tt1345836,"This movie shows that despite failure, despite your fears, despite your enemies, you can be a hero. you can use all three of those things to your advantage and become something better than you were before you encountered them. it masterfully shows and tells that ANYONE can be a hero.obviously on a technical level this film is perfect. almost the entirety of the third act is shot in beautiful imax, that's sadly only in 16:9 on 4K. just like with the previous transfers, sound and picture are great, but this is probably the best looking film to me.it may not seem like it at first, but just like ra's and joker, bane is the opposite side of the same coin for batman. tom hardy perfectly embodies bane and the darkness, and obviously he's a downgrade from joker, but that doesn't mean he's not the perfect villain for a finale.hans zimmer delivers probably my third favorite score from him, with an incredible theme for bane as well as many extensions of previous themes.this is such an underrated finale. all three films mesh together so well, they feel like one. they mean so much to me, and i'll forever thank nolan for making these films."
tt0110912,"I did like pulp fiction to a degree - that is mainly because I love the casting in it: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman.The movie is a good crime thriller that all movie lovers should watch. And in some ways the movie does live up to it's hype because the story is well written and acted out good too.But, to me, the movie is overrated. It seems that *some* of the people that loves this movie will act/talk like it's the only movie worth watching - like it is the ""King of Films"". Yes Pulp Fiction is a very good movie but there are so many great movies to enjoy watching - not just this film.7/10"
tt1345836,"I always feel like I am missing something whenever the latest BEST COMIK FILM EVAR comes along. The release of TDKR (and resulting mob mentality) is just the latest example.I enjoy Batman Begins, largely because it has quite a lot of variety in what's shown on screen. The origin story is presented nicely without dragging on. I also think they did a good job with Scarecrow and his trippy brand of terrorism.TDK was a bit of a fork in the road for me. Most people I know loved it, while I found it sloppy, pretentious, vaguely neocon, and quite ridiculous where technology was concerned. I appreciated the amount of time given to a strong Joker, though I do feel like Ledger went a bit too hammy with all the lip smacking and other mannerisms. It should be said that I am a permanent fanboy of The Wire, so complicated plots and many characters are nothing special to me (esp when you have hundreds of millions to buy the best talent in the biz). TDK delivered a pseudo version of an intellectual comic book flick, and everyone went wild (combined with Ledger's performance).By the time TDKR rolled around, I was expecting Nolan's muddy politics, pretentious writing, odd casting, and sterile visual style, yet I still came away disappointed. It's just so dull. I was invested for about 45 minutes, at which point I (like a certain someone's back) broke. Endless gum flapping ensues re: why people need heroes, why heroes need people, why cops need Batman, why Batman needs women, why Alfred needs Batman, etc.. For about an hour, I was praying for death. Then the obligatory urban terrorism finale begins. Great, we get to see ANOTHER NYC-esque city being threatened by bombs while being torn apart? Haven't people tired of this propaganda? All the resources in the world, and ANOTHER ticking timebomb is the best they could do? It made me sad when people applauded at the end, because it cemented the divide in our society. I see movies like TDKR as pure propaganda for our new, post-9/11 world. Why people eat it up is beyond me, and why they insist on calling it ""best movie ever"", ""best comic book film ever"", etc. is just baffling.If you like watching people run around dusty streets and alleyways while trying to decipher a needlessly-complicated, clich√© plot, sign right up. I'm sure it will be as awesome as you need it to be.Ugh."
tt0110912,"One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.""What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind."
tt0068646,"There are many mafia movies out there but The Godfather truly stands out among them. And it is not great just because it is one of the first movies in the crime genre but also because of it's great cinematography and outstanding storytelling .If you retell the plot to someone it will sound like it is extremely dull. It's just the story of how a son takes over his father's business. But the way the movie presents this plot (with many betrayals and deaths) makes it great and memorable.The acting is not always good. In some scenes it is extremely bad. Take the scene where Connie starts breaking utensils. The acting in this scene is so bad that when it comes up while I'm watching the movie, I just turn my head away. Of course I should metion that Marlon Brando and Al Pacino do a great job. Their acting is outstanding and deserves the pride it gets.The Godfather is truly a classic in the crime genre that must be on everyone's top movies list."
tt0361748,"Christoph Waltz and M√©lanie Laurent acted faithfully, Brad Pitt looked and acted disgustingly. All those manners of him, I cannot imagine an Apache to behave like that.US soldiers looked like they won the war being its major force? WTF? The Russians were the only reason the world had survived and hadn't become a total Jew genocide.Was this film a joke, a comedy, a drama, or a parody? I didn't get that and I didn't like that. The end of the movie was absolutely terrible as it turned into a complete joke.This film is an abomination for spoiling the history and making a mockery out of people who truly fought to save the world. Let's see ""Saving Private Ryan"" again.5/10 (just for Christoph Waltz and M√©lanie Laurent performance for the first 90% of the film)."
tt0133093,"I'm nowhere near as much of a fan of this flick as a lot of folks are, but I still love it. Some of the most impressive and enjoyable action sequences I've ever seen. I just wish I cared more for the story and imagery."
tt0114369,I thought it was a pretty good movie until Brad Pitt opened the box at the end and gave the most God awful performance I have ever seen in a movie. I watched it on DVD and shut it off (watched the end later). It's been many years later and all I can remember is that joke of a scene. They should have made him redo it.
tt0468569,"So Dean and I headed to Forest Hill Weds night to watch ""The Dark Knight"". Here's my controversial review.I'd been waiting to see this for a while, mostly because of how good ""Batman Begins"" was but also because of the rave reviews of Heath Ledger's performance, apparently his best since ""10 Things I Hate About You"". Went in expecting a truly classic cinematic performance...and i gotta say i was disappointed.The film starts out with a gripping bank robbery, done by some blokes in Joker masks. I got all excited when i saw William Fichtner as the bank manager who looked like he was going to foil the robbery, but alas his impact was minimal and he was soon dead. After his performance in ""Go"", he shouldn't be taking crummy roles like that. Anyway we're soon shown the power and craziness of the Joker and his desire to be Gotham's master criminal. Yep, the Joker is chilling but in what will be an unpopular opinion, I reckon you could have put Screech from ""Saved By The Bell"" in that make up, with those lines, and be about 80% as terrified. We're then introduced to Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, in his best role since ""Double Jeopardy"") , the District Attorney with no fear and free from any ounce of corruption and Gordon (Gary Oldman, in his finest role since ""Air Force One""), the squeaky clean cop who is hell-bent on bringing down the city's crime. The Joker realises he must take down Dent,Gordon, as well as Batman to take the city over and hatches a brilliant plan to do so. Will he succeed? See it to find out.Now it was an OK movie, but way way over-hyped eg it's listed as No.3 on IMDb.com's all time best movie list. That puts it ahead of some pretty well known and respected movies ie Pulp Fiction, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Casablanca, Psycho and Taxi Driver just to name a few. I thought it was a decent script, with an excellent cast, but the film just got to clever for itself at times, or at least for a Batman movie. Having said that I missed one or two key moments of the movie, probably due to agitation more than anything else ie that Gordon was driving the van with Dent in the back. I just thought it was weird that the driver wasn't talking and must have been a baddie. It was way too long, at least by 30mins and didn't have enough Bruce Wayne time.Solid, but I still prefer Batman Begins. Some will love it, some may think it was a tad overdone.FInally, ledger's performance was good but let's not get carried away and put it up with DeNiro as Travis Bickle, Al Pacino as ""Scarface"", Anthony Hopkins as ""Hannibal"" or Keanu Reeves as ""Johnny Utah""."
tt0109842,Something i like it was how this movie was showing stuff the are really happening in real life.
tt0816692,"""Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends time and space.""Void. Then, as the monologue continues, the void is filled with cringe. ""Oh, Nolan"", I think to myself. ""Will you ever be able not to take gigantic resources as means to tell over-complicated, spectacle-centered stories that lack emotion?"". But of course, these thoughts probably won't reach Nolan anytime soon, and my internal monologue will only be shared with you guys. Let's get into it.Interstellar is a 2014 film, directed by the beloved and critically acclaimed Christopher Nolan. The movie follows a group of astronauts on a race against time to save humanity from extinction, looking for a new home planet for our race. Apropos a race against time, time has a lot of meaning in this film - a foreboding, looming presence that you fight against, a sacrifice you make, your one-way ticket to the end of everything you know. At least, this is what the film is trying to communicate.Nolan, who has delivered great material in the past (as of the time I'm writing this review, Memento is in my top 15 films of all time) but also lacking-in-emotion, over-complicated stuff (The Prestige being a prime example of that, and I think I might've been a little soft giving score to this film). I recommend reading my review to The Prestige for more insight about the way Nolan approaches cinema, but in short, I think that Nolan's biggest problem is looking at cinema as if it was a magic trick, as if the only thing that matters is to surprise and amaze. His way of doing that is turning to spectacles, to complicated concepts with cool visuals, but by doing so he often compromises the emotional aspect of the film, and the flow of the story, too.In this case, I feel like most aspects of the film are just okay, just there to support those massive moments regarding time and space. The amount of work going into some of the visuals is truly magnificent, but I feel like I can't be moved by this film, not really. The characters are far from being three dimensional or interesting, only managing to be just a little above the bare minimum needed to sustain the plot. The dialogue is nothing more than okay - decent at its best moments, cringe-worthy at its worst.I mean, the only thing truly working here is the film's way with the most epic moments of the story, the moments that make you feel how powerless, how small humans are in comparison to the universe in general. I'll also admit that the pacing felt much worse on first watch, when so much of the film went on and on about scientific terms and laws of physics (the dialogue felt super forced here) and then tried to push this half-baked philosophy about the importance of love (which was forced, too, and definitely felt like Nolan's poor attempt in finding an excuse to this film's concept) that I felt like it just crawled sometimes. On rewatch you know what to expect, and I could let myself enjoy the more fun moments, the grand moments, easing into the spectacle as much as I could.Still - spectacle doesn't compensate for the dryness of anything else. This is maybe to worst thing about this film - it thinks it's deep or smart when it isn't, not at all. The grandest moments work best, the ""philosophical"" moments or the moments in which the film tries to outsmart the viewer...well, this is Nolan's biggest weakness as a director. It's not horrible, but it's disappointing in its utter mediocrity. I'm feeling a 5.7/10 on this one."

The film results to be a special remake to ¬®Fall of Roman Empire¬® directed by Antony Mann with Stephen Boyd , Sofia Loren and Christopher Plummer as Commodus , though is a little revisionist about characters , history and time when is developed the action . Before directing ¬®Robin Hood , Kingdom of heaven¬® films , director Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe teamed but with much bigger budget . The final product looked as although the actors learn the screenplay and decided the best issue was to take a good time and amuse themselves and both managed to stage some excellent action scenes . Great performances abound , as stalwart Russell Crowe playing an enslaved ex-general who bent on vengeance , he is very fine ; in addition , vacilating empress Connie Nielsen is memorable and attractive , she comes up the film as a valiant and obstinate woman . Special mention to gladiator owner magnetically performed by Oliver Reed and Joaquin Phoenix as evil and crazed emperor in a sensationalistic interpretation . Marvelous relationship between Maximus-Russel Crowe and an African slave-Dijimon Honsou , the deep bond lends a P.C. historicity. Ample support cast formed by notorious British secondaries as David Hemmings David Schofield , John Schrapnel and endearing Derek Jacobi . There are great action sequences including the battle against Barbarians and the final confrontation in arena at the climax of the film. Impeccable but sometimes dark cinematography by John Mathieson . Movie is shot on natural sets and interior scenarios with impressive production design by Arthur Max , but also excessive use of computer generator images . Magnificent and sensible musical score by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard , including wonderful songs .I found it fun , well-acted , in Peplum tradition and fast-paced.The motion picture packed with pomp and pageantry is lavishly produced by the prestigious Douglas Wick and David Franzoni , also screenwriter ; being glamorously directed by Ridley Scott , at his best and as stylish as ever , similarly his previous film ¬®Someone to watch over me¬® and others as ¬®Blade runner¬®, ¬®Black rain¬® , ¬®Legend¬® in which his visual style is impressive .

tt0167261,"Far less interesting than the first, and this road trip is honestly getting a wee bit long and tedious. A bunch of characters try to find each other, then they battle some and that's basically it. It goes nowhere. Gollum is almost but not quite as annoying as Jar-Jar and the talking trees are plain ridiculous. The hobbits are still charisma-less and the dwarf is way too much this time around in his desperate side-kick attempts. The last hour is worth the ticket, though. The final battle is tremendous, but the two first hours are at least one too much considering nothing really happens.Rating: 5/10"
tt0114369,"Introduction Eleven years after it's release I finally got around to seeing se7en. The movie started of well. The characters are believable, the story is intriguing and thought provoking. But then I wonder.Why is the FBI able to find that one killer amidst all the thousands upon thousands who borrow books in the library, even if the selection of books is rather exotic? Why does the killer not buy the books? He has money enough to spare and the books are easy to buy in any store? And thus he is better to erase his steps. And why does the killer name himself John Doe, which is an obvious fake name, but then is silly enough to also register his real address with the library with the obvious result that the police will find him?The library records are actually a key element in the story. The police is able to track down the killer because the FBI is able to find the address of the killer in the library register. Indeed there isn't even a list: they get the address and go straight to the killers house.There is more of this in the movie, but nothing is more far fetched than the end. The entire ending rest on the assumption that Mills does not once check upon his wife. During the many hours in which the process of justice grinds, not once does Mills call his wife. Maybe to say hello or to tell her he might be late. And thus at the end the delivery man at exact seven o'clock delivers the gruesome box in the middle of nowhere that causes Mills to shoot the killers and thus making it seven kills in all. There is no way the killer could have known the box had to be there at seven o'clock as he had no control over Mills being there. It is to much of a coincidence.My conclusion It's a nice movie and might have been a good film if the story elements had been stronger. The movie is too much based on coincidences and contrived elements and this is a pity."
tt0133093,"Insomniac computer hacker Keanu Reeves (as Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson ) lives a common and interesting life. Hugo Weaving (as Agent Smith) tells him, ""You've been living two lives.

tt0368411,"I watched this movie with no prior knowledge of plot or reviews other than what was printed on the DVD case. What early on seemed to hold a lot of promise, and some thought-provoking ideas, ended up being muddled and disappointing. Elizabeth Moss acts her heart out as Jessie, the smoking, drinking, shoplifting daughter of born-again Christians. Jessie can not conform to her family's moral dictates, or to the traditional expectations of what is or is not appropriate behavior for a young girl. She wants to be special, and she is. There are things that she ""knows"" through psychic inner vision. And when the boy she loves rapes her while she is passed out, Jessie ""knows"" that she is pregnant, but not that she had sex. Instead she ""knows"" that God told her she is carrying the next Christ. The movie then explores how Jessie, her family, and others in her circle of fellow humans deal with the situation.Some of the best scenes/ideas include: Jessie declaring that being the mother of Christ isn't special enough; being Christ is. Jessie's sister's anger because God would choose the less righteous Jessie to talk to rather than her own pious self. Jessie comforting and dancing with her grieving mother (although Robin Wright Penn really overdoes the tears and sobbing ). The way Jessie pushes those she loves away by loving them too openly and aggressively.Some of the scenes/ideas that detracted from the story: The crazy lady wailing for her lost babies turns up about five times more often than necessary. The lesbian sex scene seemed thrown in for no good reason, unless to underscore the heavy handed depiction of most all the males in the film as slimy spineless threats. The naked townsfolk gathered in a hand-holding circle in the water to celebrate a birth, was just embarrassing.Overall the movie held my interest. The pace never dragged. The camera was brutally unflattering in it's close-ups showing every wart and flaw. The production was gritty, never slick. If only the touches of feminist preachiness had been left out, it would have held together better."
tt7286456,The movie is highly overrated...the character building was spot on and so is the Joaquin phoenix's performance... Extremely low on entertainment value...a very dark movie... 5 stars for Joaquin and 2 for the makers
tt0172495,"This movie is one of the worst I've ever been forced to watch. I mean, I came out of the cinema and wondered why the sun wasn't already up. I thought it must have been at least 8 hours long. It's just so BORING! When you think about it, what happens in this movie? Tough guy kills some dudes. Tough guy talks about honour with old guy. Mean guy kills old guy. Tough guy kills some other dudes. Mean guy talks about honor with girl. Tough guy weeps for his family. Tough guy talks about honor with black guy, then kills some dudes. (Repeat last three lines until bored, and then some more). If they would have just stuck to the killing part, then it would have been a mediocre action film. But no, they had to add ""depth"" (=lots of ""philosophical"" (=clicheed) truisms, with about 30 seconds of pauses/reaction shots between sentences). Actually, the screenwriter packed the script with so many clichees he actually only missed one: Flavius (the nephew of the mean guy) is not Maximus's son. Bummer. I thought I knew everything that would happen after the first quarter of an hour.O.K. The good points: The first three fights or so ARE compelling (the other 20 or so cease to be). Ancient Rome never looked so real (Shame about the rest of the movie). The actors can act (their roles are just so clicheed the creators could have done with Muppets).One final question : Does Crowe really go from Germania to Spain in one day (Some horse that must be...), and from Spain to North Africa in another two? In a CART? I Refuse to have seen that. I must have fallen asleep for a few hours. It's possible with this movie. Zero stars."
tt0372784,"I thought this movie had an awesome trailer, so I was really excited to see it. However, the movie takes way too long to get started, has some confusing character motivation, a tacked- on love plot, a patronizing politico-economic agenda, and a climax that feels like a video game.Christian Bale is great as a tortured, wealthy man leading a violent secret life...makes sense. Katie Holmes and Liam Neeson are essentially wasted in this movie, as they exist solely to make Wayne do things--their own motives are confusing or silly. Why is the psychiatrist who becomes the Scarecrow so evil? He is by far the most entirely evil (rather than just bad or greedy) character, but this is never explained. I didn't think any of the bad guys were very memorable, certainly not in comparison to the Joker or Catwoman (in the comics).So...good effort. Nice try at atmosphere, and good acting by Bale and Caine. The bat-mobile was dumb, and will look silly in a couple of years. As will most of this movie."
tt0167260,"My comment here is merely an effort to lead the ignorant, fawning masses to the water, but I have no faith whatsoever that any of them will drink of it. The biggest bone of contention I have is with the tiresomely oft-repeated nonsense that books cannot be adapted accurately to the screen. To attempt to defend Peter Jackson and these films with this claptrap is particularly misguided. Does not a picture speak a thousand words? Has not Peter Jackson used ten hours of pictures? By that measure, he could have covered Tolkien's trilogy 300 times over! To have been given ten hours and such a huge budget, was an unprecedented opportunity but what did Jackson do with it? He made his own interpretation. He got to make these three films because *Tolkien's* The Lord of the Rings demanded it. It wasn't right to use the opportunity to spend the time and money making his own hacked-up version; to *change* the story, alter characters, omit characters, change the locations of events, *make up* various events. That he did all this was sheer hubris ‚Äì but since he's made profits, he's gotten away with it and only Tolkien's faithful are saddened and sickened. Bear in mind the money and success that Jackson has reaped by climbing on Tolkien's shoulders, having assured fans that he would remain faithful to the book.To those who really think books (let alone long books) cannot be accurately adapted to the screen, I say take a long hard look at Richard Boleslawski's Les Miserables (1935). Adapted by W.P Lipscomb, Victor Hugo's huge novel (longer than The Lord of the Rings) is faithfully covered in just 108 minutes. Peter Jackson had over five times that, so there is absolutely no excuse for altering the story in any way.I'm absolutely certain that any director in the business could have achieved movies at least as good as Jackson's given the same opportunity; and any director that had the brains to stick to the proper story would have produced *better* ones. The Lord of the Rings is apparently the second most popular book after the Holy Bible, which, I would say, suggests that Tolkien writes a story a tad better than a certain Peter who?"
tt0111161,"This is quite far from being the best movie of all time. The characters are black and white in true blockbuster tradition. Everybody is either all good or all evil, and do not at all feel real. The plot is unoriginal (although it has a surprise ending, that's hardly original scriptwriting) The film is extremely cliche-ridden, and I don't recommend it to anyone who appreciate truly great films like the three colors trilogy etc."
tt1130884,"Flamboyantly silly and long-winded psychothriller/psychodrama that tries hard to say relevant things about mental conditions, memory and trauma, but in fact is nothing more than pulp without the necessary entertainment factor.Scorsese's lamentable attempt to inject his (admittedly gorgeous) visuals with an unnerving quality falls flat, while DiCaprio has always been the least successful in striking puzzled and worried poses.In the end, all the narrative twists and impressive set-pieces prove to be ineffective due to the lack of sympathy towards the wooden characters.And about that ambiguous story-line: It doesn't matter which version is true, both are ridiculous.4 out of 10 mental breakdowns"
tt0102926,"I have seen some great movies, old or new. The Silence of the Lambs is an amazing one, while not my personal favourite of the year of 1991 it was a well deserved Best Picture win in my opinion.Jonathan Demme's direction is superb, the film is shot in a ceaselessly atmospheric manner and Demme never lets the suspense drop. The story from start to finish is enthralling, and the script is tense and thought-provoking.The Silence of the Lambs is wonderfully acted as well. Jodie Foster is the one who holds the film together and her performance here is one of her most excellent, and I mustn't forget Ted Levine who is very chillingly effective as Buffolo Bill. Anthony Hopkins however steals the film, it is his perhaps most iconic character and he proves that although he is in only a portion of the film his performance lives long in the memory.All in all, amazing. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0372784,"I've come to realize that I've attempted to watch this movie five times, and I've never made it past the first hour and fifteen minutes. I either fall asleep from sheer boredom, or I lose interest and get up. But, as a huge, massive comic book fan boy (Batman tattoos and all), I keep trying to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. But it has yet to win me over even in the slightest... Plus, who can watch Katie Homes in anything?I saw about 20 minutes of the sequel, and wasn't blown away at all. In fact, as soon as Bale put on his 'Batman' voice, my two even bigger comic fan friends, started to laugh so hard in the theater that we were asked to leave. Does anybody really find that voice cool?"
tt0848228,"this movie is pure garbage, Scarlet J is a really bad actress, you can take this movie, and leave only the battle scene, and delete the other and it will be OK. you have the same argument that transformers movie.. a cube with powers to control the universe... two sides fighting the good and the evil... the good wins...no surprises... i prefer watchmen. Capitan America is a really weak super hero, boring boring boring, i felt asleep all the first hour of the movie. I want my money back. Also the aliens(soldiers) are not so good... Iron man was OK. Nick fury, regular. The air battleship was useless i really did not understand why they don't sent that huge battleship to fight the aliens..."
tt0109830,"His name is quite clever and the writing often is too. On occasion Eric Roth will become embroiled in the wryly cognizant nature of the story, but both Zemeckis and Hanks reveal such heart that cannot be ignored."
tt0167261,"It's a movie about walking! That's it. It really is one of the worst, most boring and tiresome films I have ever seen, and I've watched loads of films! I do not know how they managed to make the film this long with not much storyline to it. I would not recommend this, there is no point to it.I can't say much more about it as it is walking, more walking and a ring. I think how they made 3 films about the same storyline is beyond me. I think the books were just as boring, and can't believe the publicity they have got of how 'good' they are, they are not. The effects, set and acting is reasonable, but that is nothing if there is no storyline."
tt0114369,"In 1995 David Fincher released a perfectly constructed modern masterpiece; Se7en. One of the most exhilarating experiences of all-time and a classic to come.A cop; Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) has just moved into the city with his wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) in hope of finally settling down. Mills will take over the job of Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) an old cop who has seven days until his retirement begins. Both are dedicated to the badge. They are put together on the case of an obesity murder, in which a man has been forced to 'eat till he bursts'. This then leads to another murder scene in which a lawyer has bled to death, although the murderer didn't actually use the knife; he made the lawyer do it. This is just the beginning of a mass murder masterpiece crafted by the insane John Doe, brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey.Whatever you do while watching it, do not see it as hollow. Se7en is far from it. Many scenes study civilisation; present civilisation. And its evil. Our society isn't a pleasant one. The film concentrates mainly on the cops search; when it comes to the mystery part in finding the killer, we discover the policemen's differences in methods, and how the most obvious one does not actually work. Of course, its Somerset, the one with the most experience who has the best way. He tries to find out why. Why some man is killing these people using a specific punishment. While Mills tries, unsuccessfully, to find out how; by studying the crime scene for clues. He ends up bored. With the help of the library, Somerset gets closer to the murderer. It may seem as though the role of Tracey is a pointless part, but she is more important than anything. She is the one who brings the men to being more personal with each other. Notice how in the dinner scene she is the one to introduce them by name. All making the climax tense and difficult.Mills is the kind of guy to pull his gun out before his torch. He has an arrogant sense of things though is 'by the book' and works. Somerset has never even fired his weapon. He sees the evil round him. And he wants to leave it. Though he is a cop so he has the permission to do something about it. But the problem is, he isn't doing anything about it. John Doe is. The reason why society is evil is because we are allowed to sin. There is now nothing stopping us. It has become a common factor of life. And there should be. That is why John Doe thinks his behaviour is OK. But the problem is he is being stopped instead of the crime out there. This is the harsh reality we live in.There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony. Greed. Sloth. Pride. Lust. Envy. Wrath. And seven ways to die.Kevin Spacey is amazing as John Doe, portraying insanity perfectly. One of the greatest supporting performances of all-time already. And he's only in it for half an hour. Brad Pitt delivers a kind of forced performance which adds to the Hollywood effect of the film though I couldn't imagine anyone else for the part. Morgan Freeman played his role with the greatest concentration. Throughout he needed a look of woe on his face. And he did just that.The writing is extraordinary. The genius, Andrew Kevin Walker took an interesting subject and created an instant classic. But most credit has to go to Fincher. Who took aspects you wouldn't even think of looking at and filming it. Together they project a deep film on our screens that no-one should miss. In one scene near the end, he makes it so when a word is spoken we cut to a character as that gives us clues to their fate. A feast for the brain. One of the most imaginative scripts of the 90s. Fincher also knows exactly how to shoot the film. Whether it be steady-cam for the slow and easy parts or the hand-held camera for the adrenalin pumping scenes.The cinematography is what makes this an excellent movie. Everything is dark. The world out there is rough, raw, grim and gritty. It does just that. The effect it makes is astounding and truly works. The sinister music that is added keeps the heart pounding throughout and keeps the audience uncomfortable, in a good way. As that's what the film tries to achieve. The opening credits are upon the greatest segment of film I have ever seen. The jumpiness makes you feel uneasy yet intrigued to keep watching. Every scene, due to the effort put in it, is masterful and is what makes the film a joy to watch and observe.Se7en reveals the best glimpse we have seen of the disturbing underworld. One of my favourites and always will be.10/10"
tt0480025,"A snippet of life in 1983- told through the eyes of an impressionable 12 year old-against the back-drop of the Falklands War.This film shows Director Shane Meadows at his best, a new generation Mike Leigh/Ken Loach. Gritty, ultra-real story telling (not least because it reflects time and events from Meadows own childhood.From the outside this movie might look like an all out ""Doom and Gloom"" exercise (akin to Nil By Mouth?), but it is so much more! It has a great sense of love and nostalgia for the time and place-not too mention the Skinhead culture. However, it also shows how the initially innocent fashion trend of the Skinhead- which came from the ""Mods"" and ""Ska"" music scene- was twisted and subverted by a racist element from within. Fashioning a striking look (near bald heads with imposing Dr Martin boots) a perfect foil for those wanting to make a clear impression of aggression for the National Front.Performances are great- Turgoose as the young fatherless lonely boy- searching for someone to lead the way. Special mention to Stephen Graham as the aggressive, neo-Nazi, Combo. He is a horribly violent man, but played with such depth by Graham, you can see he has his own issues which have destroyed him. Ultimately, he is the saddest and most tragic of all the characters in it.Graham's is an Oscar/Bafta performance if ever there was one! Summary- A brilliant slice of life from the 80's reconstructed with love , affection, humour and a dash of ""Venom""- eat your heart out ""Spideyman""!"
tt0167260,"After I have seen the first movie, when it was shown at the movies, I thought it was the best movie I ever watched. Forgive me, I was a child. Because I could not wait for the second one to be released, I read the whole trilogy. When ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"" were released, I watched them in great expectation. My thought on the second part was, that it was different from the books, but it was still great in it's own manner. But the third movie disappointed me. I could not find any sign of the Tolkien-feeling that I knew from the books and that was partially carried on by the first two films.Yes, for sure ""The Return of the King"" is the most imposing one of the trilogy, but somehow it leaks depth. To me it seemed like this movie focused/decreased only on views of great fortresses, huge marching armies and heroic battles. Unlike the previous parts, this movie left me totally cold. I was never feeling inside the happening or feeling with the characters, I never experienced something like catharsis. I can remember sitting in the cinema and being just sad. There was a lot of action, a lot of things went haywire, but somehow it seemed all far too distant. It was like eating something you haven't eaten for a long time and expecting a certain taste, but realizing that in truth it tastes totally different, much more synthetically.I think it's a pity and I hope that one day there will be a non-Hollywood adaptation of The Lord of The Rings."
tt1375666,"Repeated views to understand a movie! That is what I call a MOVIE and this one of those. If you can, just watch in theaters.Dream in a dream in a dream in a dream! Amazing concept and how they executed also marvelous.Must watch !"
tt0993846,"t is with a long due that I am writing my opinion on ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". I first wanted to inquire a bit into the opinions of my friends, and check myself whether I am missing something. Seems that I did not. I approach the issue of Wolf of Wall Street (WWS) movie with the question what was the main point of the movie? When people do or create things, they usually aim to make a point, at least 95% of the cases, excluding those that are doing things just for the sake of it. Here we talk about a movie. Here are some of the possible points WWS (in this case its director Scorsese) tried to make, and whether the means he used to make the point, actually served its purpose. Even if one does not want to moralize the story and just watch, a couple of ideas yet are hinted.According to the last part of the movie we might propose that the point was to learn how to sell a pen- first create a demand. This is I think quite a cheap point for an excessively long movie, since it is lesson 101 in each economy class. I wonder why this was depicted with the deep look in Belfort's eyes by the end of the movie when he was holding a seminar. I would have understood it as the starting point of an interesting, challenging money game that unravels throughout the movie, but this was basically it! Just make people believe they need this particular product! But hold on, this came only after he experienced personality transformation, got terribly rich by fraud and enjoyed sex, drugs and money to its fullest. Yet he has a lesson for us.Second point might be that power corrupts. But did we really need to swallow all that nudity, promiscuity, and orgies to get this point? Many movies capture this perfectly by telling a story, describing a historical event, even great fiction, but not taping semi- porn.The legal system holes. Probably movies can present realities, hence raise awareness of the issues with legislation and its paradoxes, the flourishing of corruption, and the easily corruptible heart of men (as Lord of the Rings clearly and nicely depicts). But by the sheer snugger to these facts, this movie says rather go get them than go fix them! I also wonder whether the point was to bluntly present reality of Wall Street. Then this is kind of a descriptive argument, for which I think a documentary rather then a classical movie is required. Why watch 3 hours reality of Wall Street, instead of watching a good documentary with a warning of the contaminating content it contains.Good performance of DiCaprio? Yes, he is witty, courageously teaching us directly speaking to the camera, amusing us with the Lamborghini part performance¬Ö but really, is there anyone who decided that this is this movie's take away lesson?Additionally to these murky points, this movie also puzzles its audience with absurdity rather then cleverness. Has anybody noticed how on earth the nice looking young boy, just married, with a fuse to go work, earn, build a carrier and future, just in a second turns into fraudulent, tainted mind?I also wonder whether the director at all cares about the audience of the movie. Probably not, but generally, young and ambitions people are drawn to watch the movie, learn some more about money making or find at least bits of explanations why the economic crisis happens. Of course many young boys come to see it since the trailer promises fun, young buddy enjoying girls, cars, and using his super intelligence to get rich. But I guess most thought this was simply the context of a grander narrative. Well no, this was it. And these young boys simply take away this message to be very cool!I am not demanding a light at the end of the tunnel (the movie), but I expect myself to finish watching the movie, and have either an ""aha"" moment, or at least a question mark. This time my question mark really regards the very sake of making the movie, not the content itself. In this case, the end of the tunnel was the transformed Wolf teaching people how to sell a pen. If only they knew how this little trick has broader implications for turning the business world around them upside down and build them a temple to worship their deceit! The motives but foremost the point of this movie are entirely dubious.Dear Hollywood and Scorsese, in today's culture, the last thing we needed was yet another glorification of greed- there is plenty of it, both in movies and reality. How about some counter action to the media, fashion magazines and shiny attractive starry skies of materialism? How about many many more movies on personalities that do not just grasp opportunity whatever the price, but act and strive for what is right? Even if the motive for the movie was simply depiction of Belfort's life, Scorsese and Belfort and whoever thinking the project was worthwhile, should also know that no matter how meaningless, ideas have and will have consequences. The movie sets lowers the bar of decency, and I wonder what will be coming up next out of Hollywood in this vein?"
tt0109830,"Well, leaving aside the sad memories this movie brings me - which don't have anything to do with my overall point of view, I would like to express how annoying Forrest Gump results to me. Tom Hanks is an excellent actor (I don't doubt it), but despite that I hate the movie. Not the soundtrack, which is one of the best, being Almost Famous the obvious exception.Not to offend most of people here (Whose lion' share is from the US), but this movie seems made only for them. Forrest Gump shouldn't have been premiered in the rest of the world. I don't think most of the audience outside the States certainly liked it, though it was a smash everywhere. More probably they went to see it because the word had been out that they had to.I ussually like US movies, but not the silly and patriotic like Forrest Gump. It's an annoying and stupid film whose subject matter is that in the US even a dumb bloke like him may hit the big time.Five out of ten, and that's being too fair."
tt0344727,"Eric Sykes was a popular TV comedian when TV comedians were very much at a premium.He starred in the post-50's sit-com series 'Sykes And A ...' there being some new object or scenario with which he was implicated each week. Already in early middle-age, he played a stay-at-home bachelor living with his spinster sister; she played by voluptuous Hattie Jacques. Together they occupied what looked like a typical 1930's terrace or semi, in the what-had-been-in-their-day, the 'new' suburbs. Sykes and his sister represented the lower middle-class, which the BBC seemed to consider its principal audience.Beginning on the cusp of the 60's, the program was safe, sanitised and predictable. It was quite funny in its time, and as I say - popular. Contemporary competitors were 'The Charlie Drake Show' and 'Steptoe & Son'.Richard Wattis made cameo appearances as a snooty and intolerant neighbour - a typical junior civil-servant. The show ran its course and even staggered into the 1970's, by which time it was long since out of fashion. Charlie Drake never outlived the 1960's. 'Steptoe' on the other hand has proved itself to be a much-loved classic that has crossed generations and still appeals today. It was working-class, cruder and more irreverent.Sykes was a creature of his generation. He was a nice, unassuming, amiable bloke who could be funny. But he never had the stamp of a 'professional' funny-man - not in the way that Cooper, Morecambe & Wise, or Ronnies Barker & Corbett had. Perhaps that was his appeal. But it was date-stamped - 'Early 60's Comedian'.Today, he wouldn't get a look-in."
tt0120815,"I was originally going to give this move 6 stars, but I thought hard about it and this movie had it's ups and downs for me. The start of the movie kind of made me a little annoyed I felt like I was getting sea sick watching the first part and there was too much going on all at once. I was confused a little bit too because the old man at the grave. This movie was kind of funny though towards the middle and Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors too. I know I'm saying a lot of things right now but I liked this movie though regardless of the beginning of it. I recommend this movie to people who like a lot of stuff happening all at once and also war movies."
tt0110912,"I personally find this film to be a milepost on the decline of American society.This is a film in which paid murderers are our heros, who endear themselves to us with witty banter between their bloody exploits.  It features such entrancing scenes as countless murders, S&M rape, drug overdose, and other fun things to watch (it's a wonder Six Flags hasn't opened a thrill ride to capture the whole experience).  It features all manner of completely unredemptive characters doing cruel, inhuman, or brutal things to each other.  Is this entertainment?The last straw for me was when a young man was accidentally shot dead by our irascible heroes--  the big problem posed by this is 'how will we clean out the car?'  What can you say about someone who views human life so cheaply (hit men or no)?  What can you say about someone who finds such spectacle to be entertainment?The characters here are completely dehumanized, uncaring about the horrors they inflict on one another, and ironically, much of the audience must be equally dehumanized to accept these characters as the 'good guys.' If Tarantino is the genius this film led people to believe, that would have to be his point, wouldn't it--that to enjoy this movie you would have to be, in some way, sick?"
tt0167261,"Following the masterpiece, Fellowship of the Ring, Two Towers takes the story up a notch by introducing us to interesting new characters and even raises the stakes for the ones we're more familiar with. Sure, it is a bit slower moving than Fellowship, but it's more focused on its narrative. Also, the performances are spectacular, especially coming from motion capture actor Andy Serkis, who truly serves as a scene stealer. Additionally, the Battle of Helm's Deep is debatably the best battle of the trilogy and really makes up for a few pacing issues. (as does the Special Extended Edition)"
tt0114369,"I found this movie rather tedious....it was gritty acting for Pitt, very good performance (as usual) by Freeman, and even Paltrow was good in this one. And the gory details they keep finding out at the murder scenes start to get preposterous. But, alas, it was far too L-O-N-G and could have been shortened somewhat. I think the movie went on far too long - they could have wrapped it up after the first 2 hours, but instead go on and on... And that scene where Pitt chases the suspect seems to never end...rain and all. Rather depressing...and not believable. I find it difficult to give this movie too much of a rating...my '6' is rather generous."
tt0139414,"Reasonable monster movie throwing in all the usual cliches, but tries for a comic tone which it just doesn't have the script to pull off. Someone commenting here compared it to the awesome Tremors, and the atmosphere they're aiming for is just what Tremors pulled off so well, but here despite some biggish stars and a name (TV) writer the humour isn't that funny and the tension isn't very tense. The characters are pretty cardboard, some great actors not given enough meat to build personalities onto, and as a result the scratchy, bickering relationships between them just don't seem believable, not helped by the awful, awkward dialogue strewn with badly used and at times downright weird swearing which, as many here have already pointed out, could be a result of a TV writer lacking experience writing grown up language. The few original ideas it has are squandered, and the whole thing seems too staged to suspend disbelief, a pretty important strength for a monster movie - if the setup's not made plausible, it's just not gonna be scary. Not a bad film by any means, just a little bland and uninspiring."
tt0993846,"It can have lot of display of nudity. It can show drug usage as if it gives lot of pleasure. It can use lot of foul language in the pretext that people use , and foul language in pressure or when they are in a high.but using the name of Wall St and Wolf makes one look for some details of intelligent or rather cunning manipulations of Wall St in some way, the main personality would have resorted to in a better manner, but the movie was more of all the former rather than any of the latter.I have looked at the name of the movie and then the reviews in IMDb and just by looking at these two went to the movie., but am proved wrong because the movie is not what the name suggests it to be ... i mean out of the 3 hrs in the movie less than 20% focuses on what the name suggests and hence i was disappointed."
tt7286456,"As a big Joker fan who has been waiting for this movie, the whole year. I left the theatre underwhelmed and frankly a bit bored. I really hope I will like it more with a second viewing because I love the Joker as a character. Joaquin Phoenix is unbelivably good as he is in all his movies and the cinematography is breathtaking but I just didn't feel the story. I expect this movie to be divisive once the initial excitement is gone."
tt1345836,After raising the bar so high with The Dark Knight Nolan drops said bar with nerve shattering force with The Dark Knight Rises. To say that I had high hopes for Nolans 3rd go at The Bat would be criminally understating the obvious.How could it be bad?!?!?The man had plenty of time to hash out a good script & the full support of the studio behind him.It has taken me months to bounce back from the disappointment I felt after seeing TDKR.If this movie was rushed into production a month after The Dark Knight I might have been able to excuse some of the glaring issues.Maybe.I honestly don't even know where to begin.****************SPOILERS******************** 1.Batman spends 8 years out of commission over a failed romance & no one notices that both Batman & Bruce Wayne disappeared at the same time. 2.No cartilage no problem just wear this bat bionic brace thingy & you'll be punching holes in brick walls like a champ. 3.Robin knocks on his door & says hey I know your Batman let me in & lets talk about it.OK sure come on in. 4.Catwoman has the dumbest subplot.Worse than the entire Halle Berry feature. 5.Robins name is not Robin. 6.Alfred quits?!?!?!? 7.Batman is broken in half.His spine is broken yet through the magical healing hands of a a deranged prison masseur & some push ups hes up & running in no time. 8.Somehow Bane manges to fly Bruce to the ass end of the world to drop him in a hole then fly all the way back in what 24 hours?A week?Hello continuity! 9.With no friends no money no assets somehow Bruce fully healed crawls out of Banes hole & what walks back to Gotham?Hitchhikes? Gotham is under siege & taken over by terrorists & the rest of the world just does nothing.Really?! 10.More than half of the police force charges into the sewers after Bane & are trapped which has got to be the dumbest thing I've seen on screen since Ernest escaped from jail. 11.When the trapped officers escape MONTHS later they are showered shaved & fit for an epic battle in the snowy streets of Gotham. 12.Instead of oh I don't know planning to take back Gotham they just charge at them with sticks. 13.Longest detonation time for a bomb ever! 14.The second best detective after Batman Gordon is STUNNED to find out Bruce & (SPOILER) Batman are one & the same.Nevermind that EVERYONE in Gotham seems to have figured it out. 15.Bruce kills The Bat & runs away with Catwoman leaving EVERYTHING to Robin.****************END SPOILERS********************* These are just the most glaring problems to me.There are so so many that I would be here for hours detailing every last one. This is a skilled team of film makers at work here.These plot problems continuity issues & poorly written characters should be at a minimum not at an accelerated high.Sure some of these issues I have are personal but most of them are technical.The Dark Knight Rises is a BAD movie people.This isn't the fault of the actors involved or shockingly the studio.Nolan & company have delivered a well polished turd & it seems that mostly people are very satisfied with it.Which is baffling on so many levels.Now I waited for them to release the bluray thinking maybe we would get a directors cut that at least tryed to reconcile the problems with this movie but nope.Nolan truly believes he delivered a masterpiece & thats that.I want to watch The Dark Knight Rises at least one more time with commentary.I just have to hear its creators try to skirt or justify this mighty mess of a failure.
tt0167260,"and poor characterization.As a technical achievement it's a masterpiece.  As a work of drama, it's mediocre to lame.The dialogue scenes were overwrought with drama, much like a soap opera, although instead of sappy Hammond organ music, we had the sappy orchestral score, rising and falling on practically every syllable.Jackson deserves a lot of points for his technical skills but none for his artistry."
tt0108052,"This is an amazing film in every detail. The acting is emotional powerful and extremely convincing. I believe the choice to keep the film in black and white was a great decision, as it means you are focused on the story-telling and acting rather than colours (also when on rare occasions colour does appear, it really makes those moments stand out at the time, and memorable later). The black and white almost removes the 'life' from the film, which I found to be important in the storytelling. The music by John Williams is absolutely stunning, and Itzhak Perlman's violin solo of the main theme is so moving (especially when considering the meaning behind this story and his partly Jewish roots). I am always pleased when filmmakers attempt important and moving topics that the films come out well, and Spielberg did an exceptional job on this film in all regards (from the casting, to the cinematography, to the music). I will never not cry or be moved by this film."
tt1345836,"Morgan Freeman's character goes from clever to worthless. Alfred goes on and on about what's going to happen to Bruce when we know that Alfred is always right so he's practically giving the plot away. Bane could apparently do so much with no ease you become numb and unimpressed by his character. Stronger than everyone, able to hack anything, everything. Seems to know where everything is effortlessly, where the reactor is, batmans batcave, how to hack the stock market, find 100s of thugs who have no prob committing suicide when the bomb goes off, c'mon. So far fetched. So unintelligent unlike the dark knight. Colliard's character was the most unsatisfying, not to mention unconvincing twist. I could go on and on about this movie..Jesus"
tt0167260,"I thought LOTRs couldn't get any more drawn out, with pointless scenes, I was wrong! Plus, is Gandalf actually a wizard? If so, I must have the same powers as him, because I can also point a flashlight at things that fly in the sky!"
tt0993846,"The fifth collaboration between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio, The Wolf of Wall Street tells the true story of the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio), a New York stockbroker who made it big in the wake of the financial crisis of the late '80s by shady and frequently illegal means. More interesting is what he does with his new found fortune: what follows is a heady tale of excess and debauchery based on Belfort's own memoirs.Despite the more recent financial turmoil, or perhaps because of it, the image of the '80s stockbroker has resurfaced for a new generation. Belfort's story strays into the early '90s, but the general aesthetic of the era has the same nostalgic feel, and the messages seem to be the same. Even if we openly loathe bankers, there's a voyeuristic fascination in watching their decadent lifestyle ‚Äì or what we imagine such a lifestyle to be like: high stress, fast living, dubious morality and plenty of drugs and sex to boot. The Wolf of Wall Street gives its audience a welcome window into this world.The story begins when Jordan arrives in the city as a bright eyed, newly qualified broker; having already achieved his youthful dream of working on Wall Street. After an initially unwelcome brief induction into a life of cocaine and lunchtime cocktails by his new boss Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) the rug is pulled out from under his feet, and he soon swaps blue chips for penny stocks, trading shares worth a fraction of a dollar from a Long Island brokerage on a strip mall.Upon realising that these unlisted stocks can fetch a much higher commission than blue chips, he decides to go into business with a bunch of unscrupulous buddies who know a thing or two about sales, using their silver tongues to make millions by trading them on a massive scale, all the while trying to stay one step ahead of the law. For in truth he is committing outright stock fraud ‚Äì the details of which are fairly complicated; even Belfort himself chooses not to bore us with the details with his tongue in cheek narration.The stellar cast is rounded out by players including Jonah Hill, as Belfort's toothy associate Donnie, Rob Reiner as his complicit accountant father Max Belfort, and Jon Favreau as lawyer Manny Riskin.The movie treads a thin line between satire and glorification, but Jordan is undoubtedly the hero of the piece, and the FBI agents on his trail the antagonists he must outwit. As an audience, we are invited to his party, and we witness nothing of the effects that Belfort's deceptions have had on those who were duped into buying his shares ‚Äì bearing in mind these 'customers' are average people parting with their savings, not huge companies dealing in huge sums of money. This disconnection effectively puts us in Belfort's shoes: much as they must have appeared to him, they are mere voices on the end of a phone.But Jordan is not portrayed as completely heartless. No matter how large his company grows, swelled with a never-ending number of skilled and promising applicants, his loyal gang of hometown reprobates are never left behind, and maintain high-ranking positions until the end. Even when arrested, and forced to wear a wire by the FBI, he attempts to warn Donnie, rather than let him incriminate himself.Gratuitous drug use and sexual content aside, the film's vulgarity can perhaps be summed up by its smashing of the record for the most uses of the f-word in a mainstream non-documentary film, at the rate of around three a minute. The only film scoring higher is a documentary devoted to the word.Much of the decadence is played for laughs, or at least as a showcase of extravagance, but coupled with the basic shock value of the actions themselves. One memorable sequence sees Belfort snorting cocaine to counteract the effects of a powerful sedative, paralleled with the Popeye cartoon playing on the television in the background.The film does little to condemn Belfort ‚Äì although his lifestyle unravels, and he is ultimately incarcerated, any true comeuppance is minimal. This is a reflection of the truth: Belfort's sentence was just four years, of which he served less than two, which, if the film is to be believed, were in a comfortable minimum security environment for white collar offenders.These days, he still makes a handsome living as a motivational speaker lecturing on sales technique, and of course, anyone who gets their autobiography made into a Scorsese picture starring Leonardo DiCaprio must have lucked out in the long run."
tt0120737,"J.R.R Tolkein's books are wonderful, with memorable characters, an enchanting atmosphere, strong narrative and dialogue and an epic story. Peter Jackson's trilogy mayn't be necessarily true to them, but it does have the memorable characters, the epic story and enchanting atmosphere that the books do. The Fellowship of the Ring is probably the weakest of the three, but it is a very solid start. It is I agree slower in pace to the other two, and there are some talky scenes that drag it down a tad.However, I cannot deny that this is a great film. One of the many strong assets of this picture are the visuals. The cinematography is marvellous, the costumes are splendid, the effects are great, the makeup is immaculate and the scenery is fantastic especially with Rivendell which was like a Utopia. There is also the score, what an amazing score. As much as I do like Howard Shore, his scoring for the Lord of The Rings trilogy is his most memorable for me and probably his most complex as well. There are so many beautiful and haunting parts here, sometimes even at the same time, as well as the charming Hobbits theme, the ethereal theme played while at Rivendell and the sinister bombastic sounds while at Mordor.Now I am not going to say that Peter Jackson is a bad director or an outstanding director, but he has directed some wonderful films especially Heavenly Creatures, and this is no exception, where he does a very capable job directing. The story still has its epic scope, with standouts being the confrontation between Gandalf and Sarouman, the scene in the mines with Balrok and Boromir's death scene. I also liked the pursuit of Frodo and Arwyn and Frodo with the Black Riders which was beautifully shot. Then there is the dialogue, which on the whole is excellent, Gandalf in my personal opinion gets the best of it.And the acting is very good. I do think Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here, but Elijah Wood does do a likable enough job here, while Sean Astin's bumbling yet well meaning persona suits Sam well. Cate Blanchett is a lovely Galadriel, and Liv Tyler is stunning as Arwyn. And then there is Christopher Lee, whose presence always ensures that the performance is going to be good, and indeed it was, and Ian Holm is very good as Bilbo. Sean Bean also does well with Boromir, and John Rhys Davies is a welcome presence. Aragorn like Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here, here he is more brooding and charismatic above all else. Not a bad thing really, as Viggo Mortenssen does do that very well. The standout though is Ian McKellen, who is an absolute revelation as Gandalf, the delivery to the camera, the delivery of the lines, perfectly judged. In fact the only real weak link in the cast is Orlando Bloom, yes he is dashing and handsome, but in the process he does come across as a little uncharismatic and bland.In conclusion, a great start. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0137523,I have no words about this film. This is masterpiece cult film.10 / 10.
tt0848228,"Did not live up to my expectations AT ALL. For a movie with such hype, it was very long and the picture was very dark. Too many overly dramatic lines, and the buildup music lasted for practically the whole movie. I usually love superhero movies, but this one was a letdown. I don't know why it got such great ratings. The Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, and Captain America movies were more enjoyable on their own. I thought it would be great to see all these heroes come together, but I think it really just lead to so many main characters that the audience didn't get a chance to understand any of them individually. Special effects were great, don't get me wrong, and the 3D was cool, but that wasn't enough to save the movie. Storyline was too stretched out. Underwhelming opening. The movie didn't evoke my emotions (I wasn't scared, sad, excited, relieved when I should have been). A bunch of characters that are interesting on their own plus special effects does not equal a great movie. Overall, I'm disappointed."
tt0120815,"Lame, revisionist crap. What the hell kind of squad does no recon, talks out loud, and stays bunched together? Also, many of the weapons (esp. the German M 60)are improperly, and fantastically used. How can you use a sniper scope out of the box, with no sighting in? Idiotic. Spielbergs enthusiastic portrayal of the murder of German prisoners is disturbing in the extreme."
tt0120737,"""The Lord of the Rings"", is an exceptionally complicated story. There are countless species, places and languages presented throughout this movie- yet, miraculously I found it easy to follow and super entertaining.This film is a prime example of fantasy done right. It not only captures a highly loved story but contains every element that makes a fantasy movie so fascinating. There's beautifully crafted sets, a unique and recognizable soundtrack and realistic proportions and costumes for each character.My favourite aspect of film is production design, so I might be biased...but I think the sets are what make this movie so magical. The fantasy prevalent in the sets is what allows ""The Lord of the Rings"" to be so easy to follow and enjoy. Although the movie includes so many details and information, I could rely on the sets, the colour and the style to provide insight on what was happening and where the characters were.Another artistic element that helped develop the story was the soundtrack. The music was well suited to each scene, and helped capture the emotions the characters experienced. The music included a lot of unique instruments, and had a great otherworldly sound.An aspect of this film I found very impressive was the costume and character design. I loved how different each character appeared physically. Their outfits not only gave me an idea of their background, but also their role in the story.Overall I found ""The Lord of the Rings"" very entertaining. It's an amazing example of what every fantasy film should accomplish."
tt0167260,"What a waste of time.  The lack of realism was horrible.  Why is it that everyone if raving about this director - his character relationships, etc. did not touch me in the slightest.   I can suspend reality to belive in giants, trolls, orcs, and dragons but don't paint unrealistic human relationships and expect me to believe them.So the orc army was killed by ghosts. Uh, okay. So women are killing bad ass shadowlords. So calvary can kill orc infantry+ huge animals bigger than mamoths.So a stormed castle does not fall. So 2 hobbits are barely alive and exhausted, and they're running all around.So a hobbit can kill trained warrior. So what's up with mister baggy eyes getting all that screen time again?So we have a 80 year old wizard who seems to only be a master swordsman and not a magic user. So the humans approve and cheer when an freaky elf marries their king.So what's with all these little reminesings prior to imminent death?So how many loose ends you gonna tie up?Perhaps the most annoying thing was the emphasis on the two other hobbits (although Frodo and Sam were bad also).  I actually walked out of the movie early - just as they were about to go to the 'shire'"
tt0111161,"This is indeed one of the best prison dramas I've ever seen. I've always been a fan of Tim Robbins and he doesn't let me down here. But I can't believe this is so high in the overall list (I would place it in the 150-200 range myself). Even if we just stick with Tim Robbins, 'The Player', 'Short Cuts' and 'Jacob's Ladder' are all far better films. It was the ending of the film that really disappointed me, but since I'm not allowed to talk about endings in these reviews I can't explain why! Suffice it to say that I can imagine at least two fairly obvious endings that would have been better. Maybe it's the 'American Factor', what with me being English, but the overrating of this film completely baffles me."
tt1375666,"Inception is a resplendent cinematic experience that had me hooked from the opening scene till the very end. As a viewer, I was enthralled by its intricate plot. The characters in Inception are deeply nuanced and expertly portrayed by a remarkable ensemble cast. The chemistry between the cast members is palpable.Visually, Inception is a feast for the eyes. Inception demands your full attention to grasp its intricacies; it requires active engagement and a willingness to navigate its twists and turns. Some may find its complexity overwhelming.Inception is a cinematic marvel that pushes the boundaries of storytelling. Does it qualify as what is known as a ""masterpiece?"" Yes. However, SOMETHING, just something, held me back from a 10/10 rating. I'm not quite sure what, but there's just something small missing to get it to that perfect rating.In conclusion, would I watch it a second time? Yes. Would I recommend you to watch it for the first time? Yes."
tt0167260,"I loved the first two movies. In fact, I liked Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers so much I watched them five times.Unfortunately, The Return of the King seemed a rather big overkill for me - it seemed too rushed - poorly edited - an overindulgent overkill.The scenes were all pretty epic in the book - but Jackson juiced it up too much.I didn't like the charge of the Riders of Rohan - it just looked so... fake for some reason.The scene when the Eye of Sauron topples over - was so laughable.I really wanted to like it but I just couldn't. I'm sorry.And to top it off - we get Annie Lennox singing that song at the end - I like Lennox - but I just found her version of this song lackluster. Goodness knows why ROTK scooped up all the Academy Awards. They should have given it all to FOTR instead."
tt0361748,"This is not a film that you can pleasantly enjoy, you can appreciate the technical expertise of the film but Inglourious Basterds is a juvenile and ill-judged plot.Firstly the film has a good beginning, well shot with the tension built up well and a fine introduction to Colonel Hans Landa played brilliantly by Christoph Waltz. However, after this start begins a mish-mash of genre styles which are confusing. What was with the western music? It did not at all fit with the film, and the way Inglourious is divided into chapters was odd and certainly unnecessary.Inglourious Basterds is spattered with impressive camera shots and there is no denying Tarantino's strength with dialogue. However, scenes are too lengthy and drag on. Some of these scenes are too brazen or bloodthirsty and many of the peripheral characters are largely dolloped in a comic-caricature style. Brad Pitt for this deliverance does not fit the build for Lieutenant Alan Raine, and falls short of offering a character of any vividness. However its comic exuberance does bring momentum when the film is heavily burdened and stagnated with discourse.I understand that the film was meant to have a comic-like feel, as I have implied so far but it is thwarted by its infantile development, which at times was distasteful and uncomfortable. The lengthy scenes are all embellished for the finale, and this was the worst misjudgment. The final scenes are over done, and over-cooked it is an ugly and uncomfortable end.Inglourious Basterds is technically good but the story is black and distasteful, the comedy edge is not well-judged and for all its bravado it cannot hide its fundamental flaw, being its inability to provide satisfaction from its setup to its ill-conclusion."
tt0120815,"Before I saw the film, I have read the comments. Many of You liked Spielberg's new movie. But some of You, mostly from the U.S., write things like ""proud to be an American"" or ""part of American History"" or ""every American should see this movie"".First of all, I want to say that this war must have been pure terror. National Socialism was an indescribably evil disgrace to humanity. Many of You have grandparents who fought proudly against the Germans in World War II, but I (as a 25-year old German) and others have Grandparents who were bombed out of their homes at night and could not get a whole night's sleep ever since. My parents were born during the war, their first baby-impressions were gunshots and explosions - for years! Nowadays, in Germany it still is common to find old, still explodable bombs when building a new house.Second, this is not American history, it is not German history, it is World history - Our history. It is the blackest spot ever to be found in the history of the human race.Third: I don't mean to be rude, but I think that many people have lost the connection to reality. In the first place, making a war movie has two major aspects: Making money (bad) and Reviving History for educational purposes (respectable). But then, feeling history is completely different. In my very neighbourhood, there was a Concentration Camp, only some 53 years ago. I have been to that beach in France, and let me tell You: Just seeing the sea, the sand, the dunes really scared me rigid. Talking with my grandma (she led a baby nursing home in that time), that's history. Just sitting in a movie theatre, listening to SDDS and watching Tom Hanks cry is a different experience.What I want to state here is that there is quite a difference between a movie (may it be as realistic as possible) and real history. This really happened! Millions of people were slaughtered in the most cruel ways! By other people! When I go to my University building, I see the holes in the wall which have been there since the war. They have never been repaired in order to give people something to think about. From exactly that building, Sophie Scholl and her friends threw Anit-Nazi papers into the crowd and got executed only a short time later.I think the film is quite accurate, actually. It is not the most impressive war film I have ever seen (that's  ""The Bridge"" from 1959), but it shows how the war was like. In all aspects. Anyway, how can war films be ""good"" or ""best""? ""Saving Private Ryan"" is an exceptional educational masterpiece, it should be recommended together with ""Schindler's List"", but it is only a movie. It cannot replace reality.So, I recommend this: Watch the movie, everyone! But also think about the real people of any nation that were cruelly murdered in those years, and think about those who lived through it. Even think of those who were with the regime and still walk the earth. Then, book a ticket for Europe, see the Normandie for yourself, see Berlin, see Dresden, see Munich, see the wounds of history. And see that being German is not the same as being a Nazi. After You get home to wherever You come from, I promise, You then will have a different view of reality."
tt0361748,"Very entertaining, that's for sure. Great little moments ""inspired"" by other movies. ""The Guns Of Navarone"", ""Operation Crossbow"" and a myriad of 70's B exploitation Italian movies. Tarantino is certainly clever and knows how to use the camera but then, I have to say it, nothing. The childish ""divertimento"" dressed in smart ass dialog remains there. The entertainment value is, perhaps, the most one should expect from a movie but it seems a damn shame that such a talent should be put at the service of something so one dimensional. I can't help but remember Ernst Lubitch's ""To Be Or Not To Be"" that was also a comedy with remarkable, inventive dialog but it also had so many other layers that ""To Be Or Not To Be"" after 70 years still resonates with whoever has seen it. Christoph Waltz is terrific and Brad Pitt is always great fun to watch but the experience is purely epidermic in spite of some truly gruesome moments. Am I expecting oranges from an apple tree? If that's so forget what I've just said and run to meet Tarantino's basterds."
tt0111161,"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years."
tt1853728,"My Favoriten Tarantino movie.Pro: everything
Con: Nothing."
tt1853728,"Django Unchained After rewriting history and the demise of Hitler in his last film, everyone's favorite ex video store worker turned cult film director Quentin Tarantino is back, this time he puts his own spin on the spaghetti westerns of the 60's and 70's. Those of you who have followed Tarantino since he first burst onto the scene 20 years ago with brilliant Reservoir Dogs will know that he doesn't so much as remake films but take a bunch of ideas from obscure films from all types of countries, eras and genres and mash's them together in an explosive blender and what normally emerges is a stylistic, visceral, in your face and down right entertaining film.Django is no different, the first Django film itself was made in 1966, and the original man to play Django makes a cameo in this film, throughout the film there is more than just passing nods to house of the flying daggers, Battle Royal and young guns, but like I said before none of this is a surprise and it certainly didn't affect my enjoyment of the film, my only real surprise was I didn't enjoy the film as much as I had hoped.I am not sure why I left the cinema slightly disappointed by Django, it had all the standard elements that I normally love about a Tarantino film, snappy dialogue filled with quotable sound bites, charismatic actors who really look like there are enjoying themselves, a good bit of mindless violence and a simple to follow plot which doesn't leave you scratching your head as to what is going on. I think maybe I just expected a little more, it kinda felt a bit like someone else was trying to make a Tarantino film, like a pop band doing a cover of a song that was originally done by a rock band. Maybe I am being a little harsh, I did think it was a really good film but maybe Quentin Tarantino is now a victim of his own success, he has raised the bar so high that it is impossible for him to keep up those standards.One thing that cannot be denied though is the performances his is capable of bringing out of his actors, Chistopher Waltz was once again amazing as the quirky yet deadly Dr Schltz, Leonardo DiCaprio was clearly having the time of his life playing the pantomime baddie but the guy who stole the show for me was Samuel L Jackson. He really is excellent as Stephen the Head Housekeeper of DiCaprio's plantation. Whenever he is on screen just keep an eye to him, especially when someone else is talking, his facial expressions and demeanor are both hilarious and terrifying all at the same time.So in closing I would say go and see Django, it's and entertaining way to spend 2 and a half hours, but just be aware it's probably only Tarantino's 5th best film behind Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, Kill Bill and Reservoir Dogs. Oh and if you do go see it, keep an eye out for Tarantino making his usual cameo. Is it just me or is he starting to look like Jaws from the James Bond films?"
tt0268200,"Brigham City was a good movie, with great acting.  The actors made that movie look like it was real.  They should have had it come to the east coast, because I am originally from Pennsylvania, and the only Mormon movies that came out there were ""God's Army"" and ""Other Side of Heaven.""  I recommend you show Brigham City to your friends that aren't Mormon, they should enjoy it.  It's also a perfect movie to watch late at night, the movie is an action movie and scary.  It's about some people being murdered in Brigham City Utah, and two cops played as Richard Dutcher and Matthew Brown.  You don't find out who the suspect is until the end, but there didn't seem to be enough evidence that it was who it was.  I tried to see if the suspects gun matched his or hers, but it didn't.  When it showed the suspects gun really fast it matched the sheriff's, but I'll tell you only one person the suspect wasn't, it wasn't the sheriff.  Could anyone email me and tell me some of the evidence that helps lead us to the suspect.."
tt1375666,"All of the complaints that I have seen about this movie were ones explaining how viewers did not understand the movie. Honestly, the movie is really simple to follow, if you pay attention. I've only seen it one time and I understood everything. Many are saying that they want to see it twice in order to grasp everything, but one viewing is enough if comprehension is all you want to get out of the second viewing. This being said, I would love to see this movie a second time. The acting is outstanding and the chemistry between the actors makes the movie so pleasant to watch. You instantly forget that these are actors. The chemistry between Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon Levitt is phenomenal. Also, Leonardo is unbelievable as always, and no one can look better in a suit. The topic is so engaging and I would recommend this movie to anyone. It has been my favorite movie so far this year, and I will definitely be purchasing it as soon as it comes out onto DVD. Spend the money, see the movie, pay attention, and everything will be great."
tt0133093,"Some action scenes are entertaining. Otherwise, this movie is a waste of time. Wooden acting. Fighting scenes are too long and martial arts look tedious and unnatural. Bog standard conspiracy theory story. Old idea. The ""matrix philosophy"" has been treated in superior ways in dozens of earlier films and books. But I would forgive all of that if it weren't for one of the most pathetic explanations I've come across in science fiction: That humans were kept in those cubicles for generating electric power (If the machines were so clever, why didn't they just build power plants? ... and it would have blended nicely with the story if the explanation had been that the brain's computing power is utilised). Call me petty, but that ruined it for me. There is nothing worse when going to the cinema than being taken for a fool by the directors."
tt1130884,"Either I am very clever or this was rubbish. I had the so called twist sussed within 5 mins of the film starting. It was just so painfully obvious that it had me doubting whether I had it right or not. But sadly there was no clever story writing...it really was that obvious. Don't watch this and expect a Sixth Sense ending.The editing was awful and the scenes were choppy. This movie was a blooper fest...full of scenes that just didn't join together.This is probably the hardest review I have written on IMDb because the film bored me. I just didn't care about the ending. From the very start til the end I pretty much knew I had it figured out so I didn't really care about all the pointless scenes in-between.When the end finally came I was glad I didn't care because my intelligence had been assaulted by another ""Bobby waking up in the shower"" ending mastered by the cult TV series ""Dallas"". All my watching was pointless because you were hit with a dumbed down ending that was partly explained by some poor dialogue.Some scenes were done OK (concentration camp) but some were just so green screen (rock climbing). If you are a fan of Cluedo then have a look at this but if you want a great film with a original ending then stay clear.As for the IMDb rating...another example of this website being managed by the film PR hype team. Never in a million years does this film deserve such a high rating. Probably the worst over inflated rating yet.Cant recommend...there are better things to spend your money on."
tt1130884,"Summary: This is bad movie. Don't waste your time or your money on it. There was not a single convincing, or memorable, scene in the whole two-plus hours. There was not a single character to care much about. Most egregious is that this is a suspense film with almost no suspense. The movie was full of clich√©s -- but virtually every one of them was handled without the grace that made them clich√©s in the first place. The ending was predictable. The plot was stupid. The music was not the least bit memorable. On the good side? Hmmm, I suppose the cinematography was very nice, and there was a lot of technique (mostly ineffective) with the cameras. Oh, and I liked the double-basses playing the fog-horn motif.In the elevator in the garage on the way back to my car, a couple was complaining about a movie they had just seen. ""What the h..l was THAT?"" ""I don't know dear. What a stupid movie."" ""I can't believe what a mess it was!"" and so on. I asked them what movie they had just seen: Shutter Island. We agreed with each other as they left the elevator: ""Hitchcock, except without anything good in it."" I will now do my best to pan this movie without producing any spoilers. However if you want to be *absolutely* certain to enjoy the ""suspense"" in all possible aspects then don't read any farther.Suspense? This movie certainly falls in the category of Suspense. Except, er, the movie has almost no suspense to it. There was no rhythm to the sequencing of shots, no building of tension, no small releases. The whole movie was flat, like watching a collection of skits pasted together. Alas, despite his success with Cape Fear (which was much more literal), Scorsese just seems to have no feel at all for Hitchcock-style suspense.Plot? The plot for this movie is both trite, and baroque. As narrative fiction goes it is about on the level of movies made from video games, except they don't bother to pretend. (Hey, for that matter, Silent Hill had a better plot than this movie did.) No part of this movie, not even a single one of the scenes, was believable. Most of it was just absurd. In the interest of no spoilers I have to tread lightly here. Scorsese might argue that he was trying to represent a particular plot device, but boy did THAT ever fall flat. Don't expect to make much sense, either, of the bits and pieces snatched from the real story in the original book. Plenty of scenes could have been dropped without the slightest ding to THIS mess of a plot.How trite? Nazi doctors, concentration camp memories, ""mysterious"" psychiatrists, ghostly presences, all of the most hackneyed and ineffective type. Let's see: the spiral staircase from The Haunting of Hill House, the Boogey-man from Silence of the Lambs, the shower from Psycho... need I go on? And, too bad, the list of trite / iconic references here is more interesting to ponder than the actual boring manifestations of them in the movie.Horror? I am not sure how, but Scorsese managed to make eerie, dripping, insane-asylum corridors not the least bit eerie or menacing, violent, criminally-insane killers on the loose not the least bit scary, or interesting, menacing psychiatrists with drugs in syringes not the least bit terrifying.Character? Sorry. Not a single character was convincing or interesting. There was no chemistry between DiCaprio and Ruffalo, no sparks flying between DiCaprio and Kingsly. The great love of DiCaprio for his wife was entirely cardboard. The ooky prison-guards looked great for about five seconds and then went absolutely nowhere. What a disappointment from the guy who brought us all these rich characters in, say, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, and Taxi Driver (""Stop a car at a hundred yards -- put a bullet right through the engine block!""). The actors had nothing to work with in this movie.Engagement? Hmmm. If you can't manage to involve your audience with Nazi death-camp images, and children being murdered, you've got to admit that is pretty lame. But, this bomb manages to make both of these devices and many others sterile and void of any emotion. You also don't care about the wronged do-gooders locked away in an insane asylum, the hero of the story, or his side-kick...O.K., so maybe it gets two or three stars out of ten, but the hype is just too annoying for this weak effort from an excellent director.This movie was just dumb. If you believe the hype and go to see it anyway before word gets around, don't say I didn't warn you."
tt0993846,"This film is peppered with unforgivable defects. Mr Scorsese has produced some very fine material, but this is not one of them. The word count would be about halved if the letters F U C and K were omitted. It was very offensive to me, and I have a pretty broad mind. The way women are portrayed is an insult to the modern world. And I am no feminist. My wife and I were sickened by women being treated as only worthy of being sperm receptacles for men who displayed no emotional connection. It represents all that is woeful about the American psyche - that the world revolves around 'money' and 'me, me, me'Sorry to those concerned, but it is a waste of good celluloid."
tt0133093,"With its trite Kafka-wannabe subtext and pretensions to profundity, this badly acted (Reeves is like a lump of wood, with a permanently perplexed look on his dumb face), poorly scripted, mess of a movie had me yawning and, at times, bristling with irritation. The stupid, faux philosophy about different realities was clearly ripped from a film called Dark City, which was far more chilling and unhinged, and managed to steer clear of the juvenile philosophical clap-trap that infected The Matrix (even the title is lame).Its only saving grace was some innovatory and influential action sequences and a good Don Davis score.But the action eventually seemed to contrive to divert the viewer from the paucity of original ideas exhibited, and culminated in a ridiculous, Dodge City-style shoot 'em up that had me laughing out loud. Then Neo turns into Superman: yep,s-o-o-o original. Then there's the bit where Neo is resurrected by the kiss by Trinity. It's ET and Snow White and every other now-predictable clich√© in the cannon of story telling. To top that Fishburne's character whispers in hushed awe: ""He's The One"". I would have laughed if it wasn't so pathetic.In another comment someone described this and the sci-fi benchmark for all others to follow. Excuse me?! Show some me actual science in this muddled subterranean labyrinth, then I might reconsider. I won't even comment on the ensuing two movies,with the preposterous Christ fixation that dominated the third. Horrible, style-over-content rubbish."
tt0629307,"One of the more ingenious plots, combined with an amusing assortment of minor characters (the officious elevator operator, the harebrained receptionist, the opportunistic New Jersey detective, the scheming CPA) make this as entertaining as L&O ever got.Now, sexual harassment is not a laughing matter, but it's handled in a way that's subtle yet effective, two traits that later treatments of the subject conspicuously lack. Ross brushes off the judge's remarks with aplomb (to McCoy's bemusement). Only when his handling of the case threatens to derail the trial altogether does Marks receive his comeuppance.Even the role of defendant, often an afterthought in the ""Order"" half of the show, gets genuine star treatment. Pamela Gray is excellent in this role, morphing from bewildered, grieving sibling to manipulative defendant and finally to pitiless killer."
tt0139414,"I dunno why this movie has less than 6 stars.
It's HILARIOUS. And it doesn't take itself seriously but also doesn't make a joke of itself or waste your time.Gleeson and Platt are a hilarious team. I wish they'd do more comedy together. Throughly enjoyable.Fonda's most likeable role and Pullman plays a believable character rather than some of his more ridiculous parts.The cast chemistry works... The writing is delightfully funny if a little too profane for my liking. I think they got the R for the gore and decided to take advantage with the F word... although, it's certainly not a Tarantino movie.I love it. Watch it every time it's on TV."

tt0848228,"Six (super heros) versus one nemesis!! Otherwise usually it's one against one. The fact is this film is over-hyped and doesn't live up to what it claims to be nor does it complement the critics' excitement, which is to rave the first action movie of the summer - like a ritual and to be quoted in the ads. While watching I asked myself how many times have I seen done to death special effects like a gaping hole in the sky? The aliens raining and attacking New York? Technical jargon supplemented by devices and gizmos? Some huge contraption passing for a space station floating in the sky? And so much executed and projected before that I felt fatigued! The 3D effects are absent where they should have been in your face and more - like when the black widow holds the gun at a character and the nozzle is out of the frame! The cohesive factor, and which keeps it going is the (tongue in cheek) wit, which everyone is blessed with! So much so such dialogues appear to be out of a MAD satire!

For someone who actually knows about films, it is a personal insult that the Academy Awards considered this movie to be in higher standards than...Pulp Fiction The Shawshank Redemption Quiz Show and even Four Weddings and a Funeraland how could Robert Zemeckis' (I hate that name) work be considered better than...Krzysztof Kieslowski for RED!!!!!!!!!!! Quentin Tarantino for PULP FICTION!!!!!! Woody Allen for BULLETS OVER BROADWAY!!!!!! Robert Redford for QUIZ SHOW!!!!!!! Not to mention that the Academy is such an airhead that Frank Darabont the director of The Shawshank Redemption wasn't even nominated!!!!!!Let's consider MANY important factors for this movie to be loved blindly, without a true sense of reflection and observation.Number 1: I have to much time on my hands,Number 2: It stars Tom Hanks who undoubtedly represents the white, flawless way of American Life. He is the Jimmy Stewart of today (that could not hurt). He is talented, but highly overrated. He has some excellent performances, but he always seems the same to me. He could never have the talent that actors like Gary Oldman, Ed Harris, Sean Penn, Russell Crowe or Denzel Washington have to reinvent themselves every time in a different role. He is the typical American male sweetheart, regardless everybody loves him. His star power more than his ability as an actor helped this movie to get sold and appreciated.Number 3: Stories about characters with disabilities always, and I mean always sell in Hollywood (Rainman, I am Sam, Nell, My Left Foot, Awakenings, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) not that I am saying that these great films compare to Forrest Gump, but the idea itself whether good or bad sells.Number 4: The history of the United States is taken rather lightly in this movie, all the events that take place around the character happen without his knowledge in the most unconvincing of methods. Racism, Vietnam, meeting a number of American Presidents, his unheard speech at Lincoln Memorial, the hippies, drugs, Bubba Gump shrimp, apple computers, amongst other historic events in which the character gets involved, but does not seem to grasp the magnitude of those very events. He is mentally handicaped as we are shown from the beginning, so because we are suppose to believe that he is emotionally handicap too. He never seems to get emotionally affected by anything, unless it involves Jenny, even then it does not appear to be convincing or moving in any way.Number 5: The story itself appears to me as manipulative, sappy, uncompromised and made in half measures. It touches certain issues, but never dwells on them with justice. The ingenuity of the character, his disability seems enough reason to feel that all the events are seen with a certain depth. Which they are not. It is unfair, because Hanks' charm and Gump's likeable stupidity work as a hook to entangle people's emotions. It never allows for anyone to make an effort to see beyond the  story and into the gut of what was attempted to be said.Number 6: Stupid moments, everybody loves them, Hollywood is an expert of what people like and what they want to spend their money on. Gump begins a ""marathon"" across the country for no real reason at all, half way decides he's had enough, by then the entire country was following him (as a metaphor for the movie itself). Elvis Presley the King or Rock ends up as a youngster, who knows how, in Gump's house as a visitor. Gump who has braces in his legs miraclously teaches him the dance moves that made him famous. Something that I personally cannot consider to be taken lightly is an issue like the Vietnam War, but Forrest somehow manages to run in and out the jungle in the middle war saving people left and right. Maybe Zemeckis never read a book or even watched a film (Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Casualties of War) to illustrate him on what really happened on that war. Young soldiers were getting killed by the dozen. Forrest Gump is a fairy tale based on unfounded grounds and hypocritical notions of ""reality"". Oliver Stone dedicated his film Platoon to the American soldiers in Vietnam, he went there for real and saw what happened. Zemeckis has decided to ignore all these factors and still believe that his adored character could even be immune to a experience like Vietnam (in every aspect possible).To conclude please do not let yourself be manipulated, not just because Forrest Gump won the oscar for Best Picture makes it one of the best films of the 90's. The ""sweetness"" of this movie is not even sweet, its only the a ploy, a sales pitch of the American Dream. In 20 years who will remember Forrest Gump, and more importantly who will remember that film when The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction are still in people's memories for real reasons. They are art films, Forrest Gump the oscar's favorite.And seriously folks if you haven't seen Kieslowski's RED run over to blockbuster and rent it. Its the end of the Color Trilogy. Then you'll know what we mean.thank you. VIVA EL CINE!!!!"
tt0102926,"What can one say about this movie that closed out the 20th Century and redefined a genre. This movie does a phenomenal job of translating a Thomas Harris novel into a movie. I actually like the television series with Mads Mickelson better than Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter; however, there would be no obsession with these characters if not for Hopkins' performance here. Foster is great in the role of Clarence Starling. This look at how an agent deals with her own demons and uses the skills of one serial killer to catch another is a really well done and gripping film. It took the gene seriously and redefined films of this type. It is a really good watch."
tt0508216,"This isn't the first time this series has explored the story of the lazy descendent that decides he wants to inherit a rich loved ones wealth so he decides to kill them with there stupidity coming back to get them in the end. The same applies here and we have Hurd Hatfield pretty much doing the same thing he did in the season one episode ""The Perfect Murder"", funny both actresses playing the Aunts are named Mildred to. This one isn't as good as that one, but, I enjoyed it all the same the build up is fine, but, it's the twist which is lacking in my opinion."
tt0110912,"I was instructed that I need to enter in at least four lines for my vote/comment to count.  So, I believe one word sums up Pulp Fiction: OVERRATED.  It's not that it's a bad movie, it's just that everyone needs to wake up and realize there are a ton of movies better than this one."
tt0120815,"The problem with Saving Pvt Ryan is that is is basically afraudulent portrayal of the Omaha Beach landings. Every single detail may, for all I know, be authentic for the group portrayed, which I assume was Goranson's Company C, 2nd Rangers. But that company, with one notable exception, experienced the worst that Omaha Beachdealt to the assault troops during the hours 0630-0800. Thus you get an extremely biased view of the typical experience of those landing at Omaha. For example, the entire 5th Ranger Battalion (Col Schneider) (6 companies) landed at 0740 with a cost of only 4 wounded.  It all depended on where your landing craft touched down (or allowed it to touch down - Col Schneider was supposed to land right where Hanks was , Dog Green, but had the sense to order the craft eastward), and Capt Hanks landedat the very worst spot on the entire 4 mile long landing area. And troops walked up the slopes, they didn't crawl up, inch by inch, etc. Nor where they under murderous fire ascending the slopes - very few casualties were taken during those actions. Total casualty rate for the first 14,000 or so troops that landed in the first assault waves (0630-0800)was not much over 10%, far different from what you see portrayed in Ryan. If you want to learn the history of Omaha Beach read the US Army after action reports or go the US Army Historical site. Don't bother with this movie or Ambrose's nonsensical book or The Longest Day. They are for made for entertainment purposes and only mention the disasters,etc. Beside, Ambose has been known as a plagiarist and creater of non-existent eyewitnesses.( It's worth noting that he was hired by Spielberg to ""authenticate"" the scenes. He's a very poor historian and not very knowledgeable about WWII. I found tons of errors in his books about D Day and Citizen Soldiers).Anyone who sees Pvt  Ryan comes away with zero knowledge of Operation Neptune at Omaha Beach. After the beach scenes,the rest of the story can be summed up in a single phrase : ""Call the 101st on the radio, and tell them to pull Ryan from the line."" That's all that the Army would have had to do to save Ryan.Sending a squad thru enemy lines to search a 100 square mile area for a guy named Ryan, while fighting is occurring every 100 yards is about the most preposterous idea for a story I ever heard of. But then, that's Spielberg. Anything to get the customer excited. No matter how realistic the scenes may be (I wonder about why those Rangers are moving against a prepared position all bunched together - they would never have done that ) the total picture provided the viewer is totally unrealistic. One comes away from the movies knowing practically zilch about Omaha Beach. That's a damn shame. It was an interesting story, although nowhere near as gory as Spielberg's fantasy portrait, as is obvious from the casualties taken (approximately 2000 for the 24 hours of D Day by Forces ""O"" and ""B"" (60,000 troops))."
tt0120737,"The greatest fantasy epic of all times is at last a RiffTrax! No, not Crossroads - we already did that. And not A Very Unlucky Leprechaun - which we haven't done yet but are seriously mulling over. We speak of course of Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the thrilling tale of some short guys, some slightly taller hairy guys, some thin, fey, but slightly taller guys, some grungy, somewhat beefier, slightly taller guys, and a frighteningly hairy, older, slightly taller guy with a stick, and their quest to throw something somewhere hot. Mike Nelson and special guest riffer Kevin Murphy go after the ultimate comedy prize in this very special two-part RiffTrax. This RiffTrax is only compatible with the Theatrical Release, not the extended edition. It does however, work for both the single side and doubled sided versions of the Theatrical Release. Viewing Suggestion: This RiffTrax was written and performed with the whole family in mind, so if you are comfortable with your children watching Lord of the Rings, this should be perfectly appropriate for them as well. Skip the endless reruns of The War at Home and treat your whole family to the RiffTrax experience!"
tt1853728,"I loved Pulp Fiction. 'Outstanding' and 'superb' are words that come to mind. Everything by Tarantino since, just awful.I have read some of the glowing reviews for this film, and come away completely puzzled - did we watch the same film? First thoughts that come to mind for this film; dull, plodding, contrived, and sometimes silly. And yet the plot could have been a foundation for a really good film.It started well, with one very witty section concerning a sheriff and marshal. Very witty, very clever. However, even in the early stages, it was apparent that Tarantino had bought a job lot of blood at a discount, and was going to throw buckets of the stuff around. It is not that I object to violence in movies. I forget the name now, but not so long ago watched an excellent film in which a person was sliced in half in a fight sequence. It worked, it fitted, and nothing but positives for the film (which makes the lapse of memory odd). In the case of Django, it was just clumsy violence for the sake of it, and don't say that I don't get it, that it is tongue in cheek etc. etc. No, it is just clumsy and pointless, and poorly done.There was one fight scene which was much, much better - the unarmed fight scene in the room was shocking (well done shocking) and it is probably no coincidence that this scene did not include the blood buckets.If Tarantino could do more scenes like this, there would be no stopping him. Instead, we mostly get the buckets.As for the acting, it is pretty variable. I have grown to respect Di Caprio, but this performance was just OK. Samuel L. Jackson was just unconvincing most of the time. Jamie Foxx did warm up a bit as the movie progressed, but the starting point for the warm up was at the bottom of the thermometer. Christoph Waltz was lonely on the screen as the only star performer and managed to convey some of the potential of the plot.In summary, action scenes; mostly distracted by comedy blood spatters. Cinematography; passable. Plot; plodding, dull, etc. Dialogue; plodding, dull etc. but with a few (very few) moments of sparkle. Acting; mostly routine. Oh, I nearly forgot. The titles were good.Judging by the reviews, I can only conclude that there are too many Tarantino groupies out there .....or maybe I am out on limb in thinking that upping the blood spatter content to buckets of blood is not 'witty' or 'cool'???? 'heh, look, other people use gallons of blood, but I am so cool....I use bath tubs of blood, and do it in an ironic and post-modern way.....etc.' For me it is just for shock 'schlock' and it is not ironic, post-modern, witty, clever, intelligent, challenging or any of the other excuses that are trotted out to excuse this kind of junk. It is just lazy and an ersatz form of 'creativity'.Still, at least Django is an improvement on Kill Bill, but that is not praise."
tt0167260,"I had expected to enjoy this film as much as the first two, or even more; but I felt glad when it was over, and my disappointment makes me feel ungenerous toward it. Technically it's the best of the three, less slapped-together-looking, and some parts of it succeed, finally, in capturing the authentic Tolkien atmosphere. But some parts--and sometimes the same parts--are just boring, others are just noisy, the director has begun to repeat himself, and in this culminating installment his inability to come to grips with the crux of the story becomes evident.The previous films, despite their faults, held me all the way through; this one had me wanting to leave after a few minutes. The previous films filled me with a sense of wonder, over and over; this one has it only seldom (as in the lighting of the beacons), and in some places where it might show, it's swamped by the director's overfondness for grue and beasties. I never liked his Orcs (extras in Halloween masks), and here he turns the army of the dead into the Pirates of the Caribbean. The previous films kept me in the world they created; this one kept throwing me out of it, particularly in the scenes of Minas Tirith--where, as an example, the faces, unlike those of the Shire and Rohan, included several that were joltingly contemporary (possibly belonging to friends of the director).The previous films, though of course they cut much from the books, included the essentials of the story; this one eliminates much, including everything to do with Saruman (the parley at Orthanc, the pollution of the Shire, the fates of Saruman and Wormtongue). We see Eowyn and Merry's wounding, but not their healing; we see a Palantir, but not Denethor's; we see Sam with the Ring, but not his use of it. Instead the film squanders most of its time on fighting: not only the battle scenes, which are terrific for a while but go on and on, recycling the same effects again and again, but also wrestling bouts between Sam and Gollum, Frodo and Gollum, Sam and Frodo, Sam and Shelob, etc. Then there are the scenes showing again and again--what was established upon Gollum's first appearance--that he's a treacherous villain and Sam doesn't trust him.But the main fault of the film--and of the others, though it becomes crucial here--is its relative shallowness. It fails to convey the feeling, or the moral meaning, of Frodo's struggle with the Ring. The director resorts to externals--dialogues with Gollum the fallen one, Frodo's alter ego--without ever getting inside Frodo himself. Nor do we ever understand what the Ring is and what it means.The same is true of the event from which this film takes its title. Aragorn gets his sword back, gets a crown and a good cheer, and that's it. His union with Arwen comes down in the end to a juicy kiss. And, incomprehensibly, the film omits the most important line of all, Frodo's, when he says what it's all been in aid of: ""It must often be so when things are in danger: that some people have to give them up so that others may keep them.""To be fair to the filmmakers, they may simply have butted up against the central problem which confronted them at the outset: Tolkien's books and characters aren't dramatic. Individual scenes in the films are dramatic, the actors are compelling enough personalities to put them across, and the combination makes for good theatre. But, as has been well said by the Eldar, it don't mean a thing if you ain't got that swing."

tt0993846,"The Wolf Of Wall Street details the rise and fall in real life of one Jordan Belfort who for a while was living high and wide off of other people's money. It was good while it lasted until some relentless FBI agents took him down partly because of his own hubris.Leonardo DiCaprio as he did with such other real life figures like Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover, each of who lived large in his own way with power, DiCaprio lives large with money. At first it's the realization of the American dream, DiCaprio the middle class kid wants to go on Wall Street. He goes, but then is one of thousands cast adrift by the stock market crash of the late Reagan years. DiCaprio is not about to give up his dream.He organizes his own brokerage house, similar to what is seen in the more modestly financed film The Boiler Room. But DiCaprio takes it far from a penny stock outfit. With a collection of his own ill assorted bunch of friends chief among them is Jonah Hill, these guys and I do mean it is reserved for the male of the species DiCaprio makes obscene amounts of money and spends it obscenely. That is sure to attract all kinds of law enforcement attention.I have seen very few films that have depicted the alpha male world so well. Women just do not compete in DiCaprio's world. All they serve as are sex objects. Women work on Wall Street in the more traditional brokerage houses, but not with him where being one of the boys is the first requirement. The world consists of 50% orgies and 50% piling up paper profits and later on hiding them from authorities. True of DiCaprio and true to a lesser extent of all his associates.Martin Scorsese directed this film and handled the film like he did one of his gangster epics like Goodfellas. The narration of the film is by DiCaprio and it takes you from his rise to where law enforcement has him between a rock and a hard place. Like Ray Liotta in Goodfellas a combination of drugs and hubris makes him think he's invulnerable. But in Goodfellas would not have had a scene where the wise guys just out and out dared to challenge the FBI as DiCaprio does with agent Kyle Chandler. It so reminded me of that famous incident from 1984 where presidential candidate Gary Hart dares reporters to follow him around to catch him doing anything outside his marriage. And of course they did.Five Oscar nominations went to The Wolf Of Wall Street, nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and nominations for DiCaprio and Jonah Hill as Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Hill was something of a revelation. The kind of nondescript character that you wouldn't look at twice, Hill gets taken to a world that he could only imagine in dreams wet or dry by DiCaprio. In his own Hill is almost as fascinating a story as DiCaprio.The guy who beat Leo out for Best Actor has a brief but telling role as a mentor of sorts. Matthew McConaughey plays a stockbroker who takes him under his wing and they have a great scene at a club where he's getting his first three martini lunch. McConaughey only forgets to teach DiCaprio one thing, discretion.I can understand why women would truly hate this film as they are nothing more than pawns in a male power game, but The Wolf Of Wall Street gives us a fascinating look at a man who tried to play with the big boys of the Stock Exchange and for a while, did."
tt0468569,"Having had to wait for 2 weeks before I had a chance to watch The Dark Knight, I was thrilled when the time came. After the first week of IMDb votes I kinda guessed there was some hype going on. But after 200.000 votes the grade was still 9.4. Was this still a hype or was the movie genuinely good? Also reading very positive movie reviews and hearing people go on and on about how great Heath was as the Joker, this meant the movie just had to be great, right? Well it's NOT. It's a good movie, but people who compare it to history's best cinematic productions are just out of their mind.Let me get to the first point of the hype: the Joker. I read reviews of this character being the most evil, terrifying, psychotic and creepy villain they had ever seen. I must agree that Heath does a great job of playing the Joker. But this just isn't living up to what I read and heard. The biggest problem with the Joker is that this is still an action hero movie, not a thriller or horror for that matter. What the Joker does made me laugh most of the time. I mean his opening with jamming the pencil through a guys eye may sound creepy when you hear or read it, but in this movie it's just hysterical. The Joker isn't scary or creepy at any point. He is psychotic, he is unpredictable and he is played with great depth (for a character that is flat in the script). But he can never compete with the great villains like Hannibal Lecter or even Jigsaw. Those are just out of his league. I would love to have seen the Joker develop more. The screen time for Heath is just way too low for him to carry this movie (although lot's of critics claim he already caries the movie, which would be a sad conclusion if you ask me). It's a shame Heath died.With that hype out of the way, the rest of the movie is pretty plain. It has great special effects and make-up, for which it'll surely compete for awards. But the other actors really can't deliver, even great ones like Freeman. Characters are not developed. Which brings the viewer in an awkward situation when we have to feel the pain that both Dent and Wayne feel when the lose Rachel, but we just can't feel that pain. That's just a result of poor script and poor character development.Good film, entertaining, but surely not great or superb. Get real people, look past the hype!"
tt0167261,"I have a sneaky suspicion that many, not all mind you but many, of the people going to see The Two Towers are watching it with blinders on.  Seeing only what they wish to see and not seeing what is being presented on the screen.For years we have been told that The Lord of the Rings is the defining work of fantasy fiction.  It is no doubt very thought out and well written but when you come right down to it the novels are very often quite dull and over-long and that is brought out magnificently in the second installment The Two Towers, which is itself quite dull and over-long.The Two Towers is a great looking movie and very well acted, the problem is it isn't very well paced.  Overall the movie doesn't even need to exist for all it accomplishes.  As has been pointed out it bridges the gap between the first and third films however it doesn't justify a 3 hour running time.Is The Two Towers an action picture?  I certainly hope not!  If it is the film makers need to take another look at the first two hours of the film which are only lightly peppered with action sequences and to make matters worse contain fewer pieces of important/interesting plot.  The final 45 minutes is loaded with action footage and does pick up the pace of the rest of the movie quite nicely.  The battle at Helm's Deep is a magnificent spectacle but alone cannot save the movie.  The battle of the Ents is also visually impressive but, as with the Helm's Deep battle, ends rather unsatisfyingly.  Instead of being climactic battle scenes both battles instead play as saviors to an otherwise dull movie.At 3 hours The Two Towers is over-long but even with an hour shaved off the running time I don't think this movie has what it takes to be truly ""great"". Although I do think special notice should be made of Gollum as he is very well done and the most interesting character in the movie and makes the otherwise enormously dull Frodo and Sam portions of the film worth watching.I throughly enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring but The Two Towers fails to entertain.  This, however, is not necessarily the film makers fault but due to the flaws in the source material.  When watched with blinders off The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers receives and deserves a 5 out of 10."
tt0167261,"Peter Jackson himself has admitted The Two Towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve, at least in terms of narrative structure since, unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax (Boromir's death in Fellowship was one of that film's most moving moments). It picks up exactly from where its predecessor ended: the Fellowship is split in three separate groups, all with their own problems to take care of:Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring, and find an unexpected guide in that item's previous owner, vicious creature Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reunite with the reborn Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) to save the dying kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's (Christopher Lee) evil clutch; Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have a close encounter with the Ents, ancient creatures which have unfinished business with a certain bad wizard...This second opus is less talking and more fighting: key characters are reduced to cameos (most notably Galadriel) and new people are quickly introduced so that we can be dragged into some huge battles, culminating in the 40-minute long combat at Helm's Deep, quite simply the movie's highlight. If, however, you want more insight on the characters and their motivations, get the extended cut, whose additional sequences are essential to understand pivotal moments of the third film.Helm's Deep aside, the movie's most remarkable element is the mad, schizophrenic Gollum. He's got ""ambiguity"" and ""unreliability"" written all over him, as we see him struggle with his two personas, one the good fella he once was, the other a filthy, treacherous freak who wants nothing more than his ""preccciousssss"" back (the conversation between the two personalities is one of the most beautiful scenes ever made). He makes us suspicious about his most insignificant gesture, and has us thinking the worst may happen in The Return of the King.Not as good as the previous part (at least the theatrical version, which I rate 9/10), but still a really good fantasy movie, and one of the best pictures of 2002."
tt0167260,"Okay... here goes.  I am preparing myself for another year of vicious, profanity-laden and hysterically defensive e-mails from the rabid fanatics who refuse to believe that these 'Lord of the Rings' movies aren't beloved by everyone.  I have received well in excess of five-hundred such emails, while only receiving forty or fifty in support of my views.Obviously, I am in the minority in this particular case.  Only 17.2% of IMDb users gave the first two films anything other than an 8, 9 or 10 out of 10. Four out of five people, who regularly go to the movies, really like these films.  Some are so obsessed with the film that it borders on a cult-like following.So lets dispense with the bulls**t.  To save yourself some time... if you feel like sending one of 'those' emails, just type in the word ""ditto"" and I will get the message.  Alternatively, you can be at peace with your rabid fanaticism and use your time more wisely... perhaps attending a LOTR convention dressed as your favorite character and rolling your R's when you talk to your fellow geeks.I am also going to dispense with the plot summary... Everyone has seen it anyway, and it will just feel redundant.  Frodo and Sam are walking, Aragorn and Gimli are fighting Orcs, New Zealand looks beautiful, Gandalf glows -- Yada Yada Yada.I will admit this however... 'The Return of the King' came as close to a recommendation  as any of the three.  I even toyed with the idea of pushing it over the edge just to avoid at least some of the hate-mail.The final thirty minutes of the film did enough to evoke tears from my eyes, partly from relief, partly because it was very sentimental.  If the previous ten hours of material had felt more like the final denouement, I would have given the films glorious recommendations.  Those last minutes were gentle and kind and emotionally powerful... it actually felt like Tolkien's work for a change.The best acting in the entire saga came in that final act.  The one that stood out the most was Sean Astin as Sam.  Sam acts as our 'witness' throughout the film and I got choked up watching his character in the final scenes.Like I said... I was close to giving in to this film, but I just couldn't do it.  There were too many corny scenes, too many lulls, too many overwrought speeches, too many special effects.  Don't get me wrong, some of those battle scenes were spectacular, but they also never seemed to end.  I felt more exhausted than exhilarated after having watched them.  And interspersed throughout the film were a couple of musical numbers, that felt very out of place, along with a few intended 'tender' moments that seemed awkward and melodramatic.Can I give Peter Jackson any praise at all?  Hell Yes!  He must have worked his ass off for years to make this project happen.  The amount of thought and coordination and organization that went into all of this must be mind-boggling.  I respect and admire his accomplishment, but I think he was the wrong man for the job.  He was concerned with the wrong aspects of the trilogy... the action, the adventure, the battles and the gore.  He didn't focus on the kinder and gentler aspects of the story -- the hobbits, the friendships, the beauty, the innocence, the childlike imagination... but, of course, that would not have sold as many tickets at the box office, now would it?  I think his limited and gory experience as a director hurt him in this regard.  This was ""his"" version of the trilogy... but 17.2% of us didn't really share that vision.Will this third installment win the Oscar this year?  Probably, but I certainly hope not.  I agree with Roger Ebert who said, ""That it falls a little shy of greatness is perhaps inevitable. The story is just a little too silly to carry the emotional weight of a masterpiece.""Will this third installment surpass 'Titanic's' mammoth box office tally in the US and around the globe?  No, not even close.  You could add any two of the three film's worldwide gross and their tally would not add up to that of Titanic's total alone.  LOTR is a huge box office success, but it won't change the industry in any substantial way.  Perhaps we will see a few attempts to emulate the success with more fantasy adventures... it will probably become a fad like the recent Marvel Comic adaptations.Will this trilogy go down as one of the 'All Time Greats'?  Probably not. I don't believe that this film will hold up over time, even with its strongest fans.  Movies with special effects of this nature usually seem dated after a decade or so, as technology continues to improve beyond our wildest imaginations.  There are rare exceptions of course... but even Star Wars' fanaticism is petering out slowly... and that was the most popular fantasy adventure ever made.  'Attack of the Clones' made $120 million less than 'Phantom Menace'.  I doubt that the last installment will even reach $250 million domestically.The fact is that people grow up... they grow out of this sort of thing... it fizzles away into nostalgia.  Most films that truly last and stand the test of time are based more in reality than in 'Orc-world'.  That doesn't mean that a film like this can't be a wonderful diversionary escape, a fun trip to the theatre.  But it does, in all likelihood, mean that it won't be remembered as a masterpiece of filmmaking.'The Return of the King' is the best of the three... I really liked the final scenes, the farewells, the tying of the loose ends.  But it still falls short of the Middle-Earth that I wanted to see, and thus I cannot rrrrrrrrecommend the film."

tt1853728,"This is a movie that wouldn't work with every other director other than Tarantino.
Just like all of his movies, film making top tier.
Every aspect of this film is amazing"
tt0109830,"There are movies that you can stand up while watching, go to the toilet or get another bowl of popcorn, and than there are movies, that keep you bound to your chair till the end because it's heartfelt and spectacular plot is just too good.The latter is what this movie is. There is no way, anybody would be able to take their eyes off of this masterpiece directed by Robert Zemeckis. It combines one of the most beautiful screenplays in the 20th century and a score that keeps playing in your head until you peacefully fall asleep or just die and go straight to heaven.The leading role of Forest Gump is being played by an astonishingly good Tom Hanks - such a great performance! As well portrayed is the smaller role of the mother, played by Sally Fields and Gumps big love-interest Jenny, portrayed by Robin Wright.Boots the house down, this is a must-see movie for every generation."
tt0468569,"Good movies should create ""the willing suspension of disbelief,"" meaning you forget that it's just actors and special effects. This movie failed to deliver that for me. I kept waiting for it to match the review hype but it only had random moments.The Eastwood/Devil voice of Batman needed explanation. It was too far off from his regular voice, like a crank caller. Was it just assumed to be an identity trick? It was hard to work up empathy for either Wayne or Batman. The best acting I've seen from C.B. was in ""The Machinist"" (a far more disturbing and better film than this).Excessive lesions on C.B. and M.G. were distracting in close-ups but that's not unique to this film. M.G. isn't what I would call hot, and it's unclear how she got to be the object of rich desires. She added a dowdy effect that dampened the felt urgency of certain things.Many special effects went beyond fantasy. Vehicle mass defied inertia laws in crashes; like the Bionic Man pushing a building. The bat-cycle was ludicrous in how it could blast every obstacle out of its way. The cellphone sonar was logistically absurd, if even technically possible. I like special effects with some chance of realism. The half face, half sinew thing was well done, but the sudden meanness of the D.A. seemed forced.I found the opening bank scene the most engrossing, promising part. The guy on the street corner dangling the mask had a spookiness I was expecting from the rest of the film, but it washed out. Where was all the ""darkness"" reviewers wrote of? I guess he kept kid audiences in mind. The Joker was well done but no more menacing than random creeps interrogated on C.S.I.Most importantly, the plot didn't feel naturally driven by events (see title of review). I think a rare combination of hype and the death of H.L. carried this film to a higher status than it deserved."
tt7286456,"This film is about mental illness. Specifically, a mental illness called creative diarrhoea.Seriously though, there is sooo much wrong with this movie. I won't even start with how I knew that a Joker sob story had no hope of (artistic) success, nor with why I went I went to see it anyway. I'll start by pointing out other reviewers' observation that this is not even the Joker. He's not suave, he's not witty, there are no lethal gimmicks, no morbid jokes, no anarchism, and he isn't a criminal mastermind. He's just a loser that goes off on a school shooter streak.Secondly, this is not, as I said earlier, a film about mental illness. It is a mockery of it, cashing in on the increasing awareness about mental health. There is not one concept about psychosis or other mental health problems judiciously explored in the movie (an illness which causes the sufferer to laugh in inappropriate situations? Seriously?!). All you're getting here is a downtrodden loner being subjected to beatings and injustices designed to spark indignation in the viewer, then going off on a murder spree.With regards to the much-praised acting, it's a mystery to me how anyone could have come to a judgement of Phoenix's theatrical achievement based off such an asinine script, because I can't. Not that you should devote an iota of attention to any of these positive reviews, because I'm fairly confident that there is some large-scale review rigging going on.The plot is one dimensional and juvenile, the dialogue as engaging as a monotone nursery rhyme and the character development shallow. There were goofs left right and centre, like revolvers with zero recoil and 8 bullets. Why did Arthur keep dancing? Why did we need to see Arthur fondling himself? Why is he so emaciated? Why so much smoking? I watched so many close-ups of cigarettes burn out it makes me wonder if the film was sponsored by the tobacco industry.The two positives in the movie for me were firstly, the final talk show scene, littered though it was with imperfections like the rest of the movie, which did have me sitting a little less slouched in my seat. Also, there were some interesting theories presented tying the Joker with the Batman.With the bar set so high by The Dark Knight, no director seeking artistic acclaim will go near the Joker for many years to come, maybe ever, but on the other hand, the Joker character has been rendered a boon for Hollywood opportunists, and this is the second time we've seen the character butchered in a low effort high budget money maker. This one will be forgotten quick, but I don't know how long it will be before the Joker himself recovers."
tt0111161,"It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous. There's no posturing. Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyone's lips. Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into. Finals if he so exhilarating you a high-quality music. And finding that deserves really deserve. I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way. This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars. Will remain as the best film in more than 10 years, I believe wholeheartedly sites. Definitely one of the best films in the world."
tt0167261,"Everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon that this is the greatest movie ever made.  I disagree.  First, let me say that I have read all three books in the trilogy twice, and I love this story.  However, this was too long.  It may just be that Tolkien's books are too much to try to put into a movie.  I will say that this was probably the best effort that could be made by a human.  But no movie can truly capture the feeling and human quality of the books.The battle sequences were not emotionally engaging.  And the orcs are too ""over-the-top"" scary for my taste.  I did like the sequences between Frodo, Sam and Gollum.  The portrayal of the ring's effect on Frodo was well done.All-in-all, this is a downer of a movie.  It's the book in the trilogy that is the darkest.  Hopefully, the third movie will be a good uplifting ending to this set of three."
tt1130884,"Too rarely are we offered films that are so well written (Laeta Kalogidis does a marvelous adaptation of Dennis Lahane's mesmerizing novel) that after viewing the audience is almost afraid to leave the theater or home screen for fear they may have missed some important information that will help them figure out why the story is so successfully enigmatic. Such is the case for Martin Scorsese's brilliant film, SHUTTER ISLAND. It is only in retrospect, after the shock of the film is over, that the magic of quality cinematic achievement can be appreciated. Then in rethinking the events the film portrays so well the story is as straightforward as Scorsese's vision.The film opens in 1954 nothingness - from out of the fog slowly appears a ship headed toward Shutter Island, a terrifying prison for the criminally insane, and almost incidentally we meet US Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) emetically cloistered in a ship's lavatory while his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) awkwardly waits for him on deck. The two are on a mission to investigate the escape of a female prisoner. They are greeted by curious wardens who escort them onto the terrifyingly ugly and ominous island to meet with the famous psychiatrist Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow). Curious restrictions are placed on the Marshals who decide to return to Boston because of lack of cooperation from the psychiatrists. A hurricane prevents their exit and slowly the story unwinds: Daniels is haunted by memories of his war experience in viewing the concentration camps in Dachau and delusion of his wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) in nightmares he cannot explain. The various aspects of the Marshals' investigation lead them to all of the compounds where prisoners are kept and treated and surgically altered and the terror mounts. To tell more of the story of one man's descent in to madness would distract from the viewer's own grappling with the conundrum of this tale. It must be seen to appreciate the brilliance of the story.In addition to superb performances by DiCaprio, Ruffalo, Kingsley, von Sydow, and Williams there are astonishing well crafted cameos by Patricia Clarkson, Elias Koteas, Emily Mortimer, John Carroll Lynch and a very large cast of bit players. The cinematography is superbly crafted by Robert Richardson. The music score for this moody piece is a montage of works by such brilliant composers as Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, Krzystof Penderecki, John Cage, Morton Feldman, Schnittke, Lou Harrison, John Adams and even Gustav Mahler whose rarely heard 'Quartet for Piano and Strings in A minor' plays a significant role in the film. On all accounts this is a superb film. Why it did not do well in the theatrical run is puzzling: perhaps it is a long film that is way ahead of its time. Watch it on DVD and become absorbed by all the bizarre mysteries it captures.Grady Harp"
tt0109830,"I saw this movie the night it came out in the nineties. Having no one else to base my critique on, I told the person I went with it was alright and quite forgettable. Fast forward a few weeks and the world is raving about this unrealistic, predictable movie. It was kinda like a Disney movie - probably geared towards 10 year olds.And of course once people hear a movie is great, the sheeple can no longer form their own opinions. To this day it still amazes me that the movie is considered a modern masterpiece. Oh well, remove your brain and enjoy Tom Hank's worst acting performance if it makes you happy."
tt0816692,"Overall, ""Interstellar"" was an underwhelming experience for me.The film spent too much time establishing characters and relationships that in the end just felt unconvincing and contrived.It was full of wooden dialogue. The parts in which the scientists dropped basic astrophysical knowledge in a Wikipedia-like diction were cringeworthy.The conclusions to which they jumped (aliens put the wormhole there to save the human race, love has to be the fifth dimension) rendered these characters completely unbelievable to me.The turn of events by which Cooper came to be the chosen pilot of the spacecraft, that was probably the most painfully impotent writing I have ever seen in a large budget movie.The film completely failed to show the space pioneers having any sense of awe in light of the incredible things they were witnessing. When Cooper was told about the existence of a wormhole near Saturn and the habitable planets on the other side, he took it like a boring lecture and the most obvious thing ever. This grotesquely ignorant attitude was visible throughout the whole movie. Characters only ever showed care and concern for their own families or abstract concepts like ""the human race"". I found this totally anthropocentric perspective not credible at all and highly unlikeable.However, when the spacecraft passed Saturn, it was beautiful to look at. The spheric wormhole was simply breathtaking. Although the scene was way too short, it was one of the best.The black hole and its center was also quite good.Visually, the film lacked imagination and scope in every other aspect. Most of the space scenes consisted of unexciting chamber shots inside the spacecraft. The beauty and wonder of the foreign planets wasn't explored at all. Besides a very cool tidal wave, the most exciting thing happening there was a stupid brawl between two astronauts on a rocky surface.There was also a risky docking maneuver in space that was thrilling, but depressing nonetheless. When a standard action beat such as a docking maneuver is the most exciting scene in a film about intergalactic space travel, you know the scriptwriter did something wrong.The scene where Cooper meets his daughter as an old woman was very touching and well executed. It reminded me of one of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes, ""The Long Morrow"".In my opinion, the film suffered from a weak screenplay and little imagination."
tt0114369,"A film designed to appeal to those who have a fascination with graphic cruelty and sadism. The film telegraphs it's ending from the moment in the middle of the film when Pitt, the detective, shouts after the killer: ""My name is Mills. That's spelled, M-I-L-L-S !"" It's a wonder he didn't add: ""And I live with my much loved wife at 18 Ceder Street, Apartment 3b"". (In how many of these films does the killer eventually wind up going after the hero's beloved wife or child as part of the movie's climax? It's so much of a cliche of the genre that it's become a standard closing plot element.) The most depressing part of this film experience is not that the good guys' lose and that the Jeffrey Dahlmer wannabe triumphs, it is that Hollywood will do anything for a buck - and that has to be another catagory of deadly sin not originally contemplated by Dante. I don't care how good the special effects are. If the movie sets out to use them to deliberately sicken the viewer; then it is an unimaginative misuse of the technology. A 1 out of 10, with 9 points lost for depravity and the cynical exploitation of the viewing public."
tt1345836,"The Dark Knight Rises Review 3/5The expectations were high for this film given that it was a direct follow up to The Dark Knight. With a great storyline, memorable characters, groundbreaking action scenes and a perfect performance by Heath Ledger it was easily one of the best comic book adaptations to date. But even that film had its flaws but not as much as this one. At the time of its release a lot of the critics received backlash and even death threats from the rabid fans. The fans were even worse than the Star Wars fans. Anyway The Dark Knight Rises is far from perfect but it does have some enjoyable moments throughout.Eight years have past since the events of The Dark Knight. Bruce Wayne is retired living his life in isolation, The Joker is locked away and Gotham City's crime rate is at an all time low. But the masked villainous Bane and his army are lurking in the sewers and he has a plan. After hearing about Commissioner Gordon being hospitalised and encountering a mysterious cat burglar Bruce Wayne decides to come back out of retirement. It's a real crowd pleaser when he comes back as Batman but he has to go toe to toe with his toughest opponent yet. He's not as fast as he used to be however that is what gives the film it's edge, we can finally root for Bruce Wayne because he is in a vulnerable state here. Bane is sort of like a 60s Bond villain taking the city hostage threatening to blow it up if anyone leaves.The opening plane hijack sequence is breathtaking and like the majority of the action sequences it was shot in IMAX using practical effects. From miniatures to daring stunts we see real stuntmen hang off of the dangling plane fuselage. The overall action scenes are intense accompanied by an epic music score by returning composer Hans Zimmer. Although some of them suffer from bad editing they are still enjoyable and look spectacular. It's best to watch it with surround sound speakers as the sound effects make the experience more immersive from Banes heavy breathing, the bone crunching punch ups to the extremely loud gunshots and explosions. It's the most action packed of the trilogy but it suffers from a thin plot.Christopher Nolan does a fine job directing the film but not much can be said about his screenplay. Unfortunately it's his worst writing yet making this the most implausible chapter. It's full of so many character storylines and it just gets confusing. There are a lot of things that make little to no sense. There isn't much logic to many of the scenes, there are some obvious twists throughout and a lot of things go by unexplained. Using flashbacks it harps back to previous plot lines and characters in an attempt to make it feel more connected to those films. On top of all that it runs at nearly 3 hours which is just too long considering how half baked the plot is.Aside from all of this Christian Bale gives his best performance as a more weary broken Bruce Wayne. Tom Hardy is really good in the role of Bane and every time he's on screen he is physically imposing, very intimidating and he has some great lines of dialogue. Michael Caine is only in it briefly but he gives an emotional nuanced performance as family butler Alfred. Joseph Gordon Levitt and Anne Hathaway both do serviceable jobs - However with such a big cast the film didn't really need them, they are just there for fan service and to be honest their story arcs are not very interesting. But that being said Hathaways cat suit has a cool realistic look to it which fits well within the continuity of the Nolan franchise. That's one thing you can give them credit for is they make these films as grounded in reality as possible. But with outlandish characters like Bane and Catwoman there are a lot of things they have to compromise like Selina Kyle/Catwomans backstory. She wasn't resurrected by cats like the comics, she is simply just a woman who is very good at sneaking about. Bane isn't a raging hulk who gets pumped on steroid juice he's just a conflicted man who has been through some bad stuff. Overall it's a thourouly enjoyable film but it's let down by lazy writing full and plot-holes."
tt0137523,"A lot of people I know have never even heard about this film.
Good to see the system works"
tt0816692,"As directed by Christopher Nolan, he of the pretentious, derivative, mind-bending crap-fest that was Inception and the vastly over-rated Dark Knight trilogy, I fully expected Interstellar to have plot holes you could pilot a space station through‚Äîand, with a whopping running time of 169 minutes, I figured staying awake would be a task almost as gargantuan as the film's black hole (which is actually called Gargantua‚Äîthat's just how gargantuan it is!!!).Sure enough, the preposterous pseudo-scientific plot can be picked apart with ease, but the film itself is something of an anomaly: although it is a grossly indulgent pile of pretentious hooey that stretches plausibility to breaking point, I found myself entertained throughout. Interstellar is so far up itself that it actually transcends all the laws of cinema and proves to be a rather enjoyable piece of big-budget baloney as a result.For starters, we get Matthew McConaughey's farmer Cooper, who is chosen to pilot NASA's only spacecraft, despite having spent the last decade or so growing corn. Then we get two of science-fiction's most aesthetically awkward robots in the form of A.I. units TARS and CASE. After flying through a worm-hole, Cooper lands his spacecraft in several inches of water and then surfs a massive tidal wave. We see a planet so cold that its clouds are solid ice. We have a mad scientist who rants about the human instinct for survival while head butting Cooper with his space helmet. Although Michael Caine's character spans 23 years, he doesn't look a day older than when we first see him (his voice just gets a bit hoarse, but not Batman hoarse). And Cooper enters a black hole where he ends up behind a 5-dimensional bookcase that allows him to manipulate gravity to send a message to his daughter via wristwatch!!!And that's just the stuff I can recall right now (it's waaay past my bed-time and I'm very tired).If only there had been a few ninjas, some gratuitous female nudity (perhaps a race of insatiable, sexy alien maidens with over-sized breasts), a planet of space zombies, and a laser battle, this would have been the perfect so-bad-it's-good movie.7/10: it's too wonderfully silly for me too hate on it as much as I really should."
tt0993846,"My first exposure to The Wolf of Wall Street came when I saw a trailer for the film attached to World War Z and while I certainly thought the movie looked interesting, I wasn't sold on it due to the content I was seeing so I avoided the movie when it first came out and didn't watch it until earlier this year and while I was taken aback by the sheer amount of explicit content in a few scenes, I absolutely loved the movie. From it's solid directing and fast-paced humor to its incredible acting and story, The Wolf of Wall Street is another cinematic home run for Martin Scorsese.The film starts in 1987 where a young man named Jordan Belfort gets a job working as a stockbroker for a stock company called L.F. Rothschild where he is hired to work under Mark Hanna who introduces Jordan to the drug and sex-fueled broker culture and plants the idea in Jordan's head that making money for one's self is a stockbroker's ultimate goal and that enough is never enough. With these words in mind, Belfort goes to work but following Black Monday, his career is terminated and gets a job at a small brokerage firm company. Thanks to his combative pitching style, Jordan begins to profit but soon forms his own investment broker company with a few friends called Stratton Oakmont. After posting an ad, hundreds of young brokers come flocking to Belfort's company. As a result of the business profiting, Jordan and his entourage profit handsomely from it and soon descend into a life of drugs and women with Jordan even cheating on his own wife. Meanwhile, the FBI and the SEC begin investigating Belfort's firm and start to clamp down on the corporation which leads Jordan to try and find a way to keep his firm and his money from collapsing while also dealing with his own personal issues.Given the unsubtle condemnation of the Wall Street stockbroker approach and lifestyle in Oliver Stone's 1987 movie, Wall Street, it would seem to clarify the basis of The Wolf of Wall Street, a movie that makes all of Oliver Stone's most barbarous neutering of the overindulgence on the stock exchange look like a walk in the park by comparison. Truly, the movie all but instantly endorses this in an early scene where an editorial is advertising a colossal uptick in job applications at Jordan's firm. So, with the need for the movie to go much more larger and colossal in terms of showing the decline of a character like Belfort, the movie shows him literally snorting cocaine out the body of a women and yet by some means continues to go downhill further and further until he is waist-deep in self-indulgence and extravagance. Despite the movie feeling endlessly long and overly bouncy sometimes, it's also a film that is grueling as well as intoxicating to watch and while it may feel less like an organized story and more like an almost three-hour decadence agenda, it still nonetheless carries it's own cinematic weight and gives the viewer a masterpiece of storytelling and character drama not seen since The Godfather.Martin Scorsese is easily one of the greatest directors still working today and The Wolf of Wall Street just keeps on showing us why he is such an incredible director and storyteller with an almost absurd amount of excitement and passion for the art of filmmaking. In a lot of ways, The Wolf of Wall Street feels like something of a follow-up to two of his most beloved and acclaimed movies, Casino and Goodfellas even though the movie takes place in its own universe and Jordan Belfort is a professional convict who does more harm with a pen than a gun in the film. Despite that, all three movies survive as Martin's own disembowelment of the cynicism of the American Dream and much like Goodfellas, The Wolf of Wall Street grants the viewer entry into a symbolically glittering world. Much like the casinos of Las Vegas in Casino or the Irish Mob of Boston in The Departed, Wall Street is depicted as a bona fide playground for those people with no moral high ground. Sex, drugs, and money are all here and are frequently shown on screen, sometimes even in the same scene which can be a bit unsettling for some viewers but is necessary to progress the story and the characters. Much like several of his other movies, Scorsese feels less concerned with the methods Belfort makes his money and more with how money and power can corrupt a person no matter their social background. Early on in the film, some of the characters are having a conversation about tossing short people at targets for their own delight and going through what can or can't be done in terms of entertainment. Selfishness and fraud are depicted here as wide-ranging and irresistible as Jordan's decadence is nothing short of outlandish but it also encompasses every single last inch of his company so much so that there have to be sighs in the bathrooms outlawing lovemaking and even Belfort's butler gets dragged into the cycle of sex, drugs and cash driving home the point that even the most cultured people can become contaminated by power and greed. Of course, the movie is quite honest about it's leading character, Jordan Belfort who may seem like your typical lawbreaker and scam artist but is also an erratic storyteller. The film engages interest to this continuously, most noticeably in the contrast between his interpretation of a drug-hazed drive home and what actually happened along with the ramifications of that drive. In lieu of presenting an accurate and fair depiction of Jordan's behavior, the movie cleverly allows him to give his own account of what is happening onscreen. As such, The Wolf of Wall Street gives Belfort small apologetic moments sprinkled within his flashes of harshness, antipathy, sexism, anger, and cold-bloodiness. Easily one of the best film characters ever to grace the silver screen.While The Wolf of Wall Street may feel like a heavenly accomplice to some of Scorsese's earlier movies, it's obvious with this movie and later with Silence that Martin has matured greatly as a filmmaker and a storyteller. This movie, however, feels more like a bigger step for Scorsese and company as well as a much more adventurous and unproven with Scorsese continuously pulling the viewer's leg with how phony the movie really is. Masterfully aided by Terrence Winters' wonderful screenplay, Martin crafts a hazy impression of hyper-reality around the movie's events, making it feel like something in a drug-fueled fog. Of course, Scorsese constantly pulls the viewer's attention to the fact that the movie they're watching is, in fact, a movie as the aspect ratio always seems to continuously alter as the film progresses as even the boundaries of the screen change from scene to scene which fits with the story that the film is trying to show us. Marketing also plays a high part in The Wolf of Wall Street such as when Belfort fills the viewer on the facts surrounding a crazy money laundering scam or when the FBI arrest Jordan while he's filming a commercial but the agents don't stop with just apprehending Belfort as they also process to directly interrupt the entire shot-on-camera scene making for easily one of finest apprehension scenes in film history. It's also one of the boldest and divisive storytelling ideas in the movie. Also effective in the story that The Wolf of Wall Street is telling is how Scorsese grants Dicaprio free rein over the movie's plot. At one point, Belfort's voice-over straightens out the movie over the color of his car, giving the viewer an awareness of Jordan's preferences in telling his own story through the narration rather than just explaining what is happening to us as the movie certain enough to let Belfort to show us his story unfolding on the screen rather than just dumping explanation dialog on us like some other movies have a tendency to do.At its heart, The Wolf of Wall Street is in essence penned as a cavalier endeavor at self-defense by a calculating maniac as he goes through various stages of decadence and self-indulgence as well as having to deal with the government breathing down his neck at every turn. Unlike directors like Paul Feig or Michael Bay who often insult the viewer's intelligence, Martin Scorsese trusts us enough to allow us to use our brains in order to realize that Jordan can't be trusted which might seem like a massive jump for a movie director of Scorsese's caliber but taking into account the movie has generated debates about how it portrays Belfort much like how Pulp Faction has kindled similar disputes, it would seem that Martin has misjudged filmgoers and, yet the movie never once makes any sort of sympathy pea for Jordan or even paste a convenient moralistic accusation over the end credits as it simply isn't essential for what the film is showing us. Any person watching the movie who can't even use their brain to figure out how disgraceful Jordan is, regardless of his efforts to justify his behavior, would have to be very improbable to be convinced by a corny afterthought or a condescending honest condemnation. The film is continuously harsh in its judgment of Jordan, so much so that the FBI agent that is questioning him seems to find Belfort notably repulsive due to there being no justification for his extreme excess as Jordan wasn't born into this lifestyle but rather chose to live it which in turn makes the story all the more complex and compelling.Given how the film is adapted from the book by the same name, The Wolf of Wall Street gives Jordan the freedom to create his own protection. During a pep talk scene, Belfort discusses to his employees how he gave a struggling single mother money to help her family and while the movie counts on the viewer to consider that this is a self-directed act of generosity as a counteract against his sexist demeanor over the course of the film. Jordan's firmness that he will do anything to ensure his families' safety is counterbalanced by disregard and irresponsibility and his esteem for allegiance is"
tt0146414,"Don't confuse this story and the Popeye cartoon labeled ""Aladdin And His Wonderful Lamp."" This is another early 1930s Celebrity Productions Comicolor cartoon based on a famous novel.They did a number of these takeoffs such a this one, Don Quixote, Sinbad the Sailor, Ali Baba, Jack And The Beanstalk, Robin Hood, etc.Whatever, this one doesn't measure up to any of the above cartoons. It has a few quick moments of humor but nothing memorable and it's more a ""cute"" little story than a comedy. Unfortunately, it's supposed to be the latter so I can't really recommend this one. The color is decent, especially for a cartoon so old, but it just isn't funny nor entertaining.There is a lot of action in here but not the kind that will keep you enthralled. It winds up being more noise than anything else. It's not of the company's best."
tt0372784,"This is certainly, without question the best Batman film ever made, although that isn't saying much. Christopher Nolan makes this into a very dark and brooding tale that tells more about Bruce Wayne than Batman, something the other movies would never have done. Nolan is a great director and he takes a great leap of faith by showing perhaps the most important screen superhero in such a way that the city of Gotham and its components don't feel like taken from a comic book, but from real life. Batman Begins is based more on graphic novels and the original characters by Bob Kane, so the realism and details are there without all the fluff and showboating Joel Schumacher would have put out. Christian Bale is perfect as the title character and he creates a more interesting Bruce Wayne than Batman only because we see more of Wayne in this installment. All other roles are perfectly cast, especially Liam Neeson as a mysterious yet intelligent and brutal member of the League of Shadows. Katie Holmes is nice and sweet as Wayne's childhood friend, and there will never be another Alfred as long as Michael Caine resides.Simply put, Batman Begins is worth the time and money. It pulls you into a world you would never expect to see in a Batman movie, than transports you to Gothan City, the rotting core of it mostly. When we do get a glimpse of Batman, it really is quite different than other interpretations. The action here is based more on suspense than violence and the plot moves along quite well to make this movie feel shorter than its 140 minute running time. So, if you are going to see The Dark Knight this weekend, be sure to check this out first. Indeed, if it is anything like this one, this franchise is going somewhere truly spectacular."
tt7286456,"No joke this is by far the best movie that I've ever watch in my entire life and surpassing the magnificent movie 'Seven' (1995). At first I felt bad for the protagonist Arthur Fleck but when he starting to change into becoming the Joker I felt terrified of him which is amazing that the movie accomplished that. This movie is also not for everyone because of the lack of action and always annoys me when people saying this movie is bad with the reason of ""This movie is boring"". I really recommend you who likes a good story but I do not recommend this to the people who just want action like every Marvel movie."
tt0120737,"Let me begin by saying that I'm not one of the many who are avid fans of the Lord of the Rings series. I have not read any of the books. I can not comment on how the movie compared to the book in any way. I have never seen a movie open up to more glowing praise than this one. I expected to be enthralled. Boy was this movie a letdown. Nothing but an endless battle against too numerous bad guys. Cared nothing for the characters or their quest- the movie never drew me in. When it ended, nothing but a bunch of ""That's It!"" from the audience around me. My thoughts exactly! I shuffled around in my seat for three hours, hoping something good would come along. I'll admit it was a visually stunning movie, but nothing else."
tt0137523,After watching this movie I was totally filled with enthusiasm. Fight Club is definitly Fincher's best movie even better than se7en. It's not only the story but the optics which fascinated me. When I had seen it for the second time I could see this movie with the knowledge of the conclusion which is really fascinating as you'll see Fight Club in a totally different perspective. Also great about Fight Club is its soundtrack performed by the Dust Brothers and especially the song 'Where is my mind' by the Pixies which really fit to the end of the movie. Unfortunately Fight Club didn't have much success in Germany but anyway the movie got best reviews of the German press. I also have to mention the brilliance of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt who plays best in roles in which he performs the villain. But it's quiet amazing what Edward Norton is able to do - he is just overwhelming. For that role he has to get the oscar.
tt1130884,"At the end of this movie, there are going to be only two kinds of audience: one, which will feel cheated because it watched in incredulity as one of the characters in the film shamelessly reveals the mystery flat out within the first 10 minutes, as if the director, sick with fear that the audience would feel betrayed, couldn't help himself; the second kind which would not notice the above and go on to watch the entire flick trying to assemble and reassemble the puzzle pieces, only to let out a groan in self-disgust for not having paid enough attention in the beginning.Whether you like this movie or not will depend on which of the above two categories you fall in. I watched this movie with my nephew. As the suspense was revealed, we both looked at each other and uttered almost together, ""What the hell...!?"" Movie itself is not so bad and has some decent performances and atmosphere, but it will all be meaningless if you are the first kind of audience."
tt0172495,"I kept waiting for whatever made this movie win Oscars. Never saw it. Watch ""Ben Hur."" Watch ""The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire."" Watch, above all,""Spartacus."" ""Crouching Tiger"" was ROBBED. There is no comparison. This movie took great scenes from great movies, and took the heart out of them. It added great digital imaging - but not as ground-breaking as, say, ""Matrix."" I was bored: really, truly bored. And I went in ready to love this flick. It had violence, history, even a touch of romance. And failed to make me stay awake. The biggest, most expensive bore since Liz Taylor tried Cleopatra!"
tt0111161,"In the early '80's, Stephen King read a short story by Leo Tolstoy called God sees the truth, but waits - a man falsely accused of murder is incarcerated and over the course of decades grows to be well liked and respected by the other inmates, and eventually someone shows up at the prison who can prove his innocence. Sound familiar? King promptly ripped it off and re-packaged it as Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The main difference being that in the Russian original the dude dies in prison while waiting for his release papers to be processed whereas Stephen King had to rewrite it to give it the cheap cheesy family feel-good Disney ending that Americans have been trained to expect from everything.Darabont substitutes melodrama for an actual pulse: Like the scene where Andy crawls through a quarter-mile of Diarrhea and comes out clean on the other side, oh Lordy Hallelujah all things are possible in America! (Jazz hands). And I hate to seem like nitpicking, but if you're gonna crawl through a tightly enclosed tube in a quarter-mile of s**t, you will either pass out from the unbearable fumes and drown in diarrhea, or at the very least, have your lungs filled with fecal matter and experience some severe adverse health effects, but no, Andy is perfectly fine because that's how that scenario would totally play out. Or the ending when Red is finally released from prison - ""Oh I hope I get to see my friend again oh I hope the sea is as blue as I remember"" - And then they meet on the beach and live happily ever after because that's how prison goes -- Thug Life.The movie is indistinguishable from anything else - It does nothing new - no new techniques, story structure, presentation. It is your standard, typical, by-the-book story. There is nothing to distinguish its direction - you could've replaced Darabont with Spielberg or Zemeckis and it would've come out about the same. There is nothing to distinguish it visually - You could've replaced Roger Deakins with another big name and it would've come out more or less the same. It could've been made by any director specializing in over-sentimentality, shot by nearly anyone, produced by anyone, there are no unique or distinguishable fingerprints on it."
tt0120815,"Together with ""Schindler's List (1993) and ""Platoon"" (1986), ""Saving Private Ryan"" ranks as one of the greatest war movies of all time. Like ""Platoon"" it gives the viewer an ""in the trenches"" experience.Spielberg has hit another home run with this one. The battle scenes are so realistic and gut wrenching that the viewer is left with the impression of what the real battles were actually like. Spielberg conveys the uselessness and futility of war as we follow Tom Hanks and his squad in their search for Private Ryan following a devastating battle on D-Day.Spielberg's two World War II masterpieces, Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan should be required viewing at the high school level in order to instill in our youth a sense of the sacrifices that were made over a half a century ago in order to preserve our freedom."
tt0102926,"I had read this book by Thomas Harris and thought it would make a great movie but was concerned when I heard that Jonathan Demme was making it. How wrong I was though and I was overwhelmingly surprised. It was the first film about a serial killer where it did not rely on strong elements of violence and gore but simply left it to the imagination. Obviously Hopkins and Foster get all the plaudits and rightly so but this is one of the only films that has so many superb minor characters such as Barney, Ardelia Mapp and Bill himself. I urge those who like this movie to watch the making of documentary as it is truly fascinating. A roller-coaster ride of emotions and tension which I enjoy every time I watch it."
tt1130884,"I really wish I knew who to ask to get my money back from. This was the biggest waste of time, red vines, popcorn, and human effort. If you wait until this movie comes out on cable you will still be upset that you wasted your time watching it. My girlfriend got angry at me for taking her to this awful movie. She was in such a bad mood after we saw this terrible film that we had no sex. It didn't matter though because my sex drive has been killed by looking at dead babies floating in a lake, holocaust victims, and bad acting. I have never seen an entire crowd of people exiting a theater more bummed out. If you are thinking of going to see this movie, take some money out of your wallet and throw it in the street. It will be more satisfying and take less time."
tt1130884,"I can't help but feel that if some random name was attached to this picture as director, the ratings would be a lot lower. This is a dull, plodding film that lacks both the thrills of genre and the insight of cinema. But I'm truth, I have generally found Scorcese to be sort of dull as a storyteller."
tt0137523,After watching this movie I was totally filled with enthusiasm. Fight Club is definitly Fincher's best movie even better than se7en. It's not only the story but the optics which fascinated me. When I had seen it for the second time I could see this movie with the knowledge of the conclusion which is really fascinating as you'll see Fight Club in a totally different perspective. Also great about Fight Club is its soundtrack performed by the Dust Brothers and especially the song 'Where is my mind' by the Pixies which really fit to the end of the movie. Unfortunately Fight Club didn't have much success in Germany but anyway the movie got best reviews of the German press. I also have to mention the brilliance of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt who plays best in roles in which he performs the villain. But it's quiet amazing what Edward Norton is able to do - he is just overwhelming. For that role he has to get the oscar.
tt1345836,"Didn't think this film lived up to the hype surrounding it. It was good, don't get me wrong but it didn't compare with the Dark Knight. Seemed too full of action and definitely violence, which obscured the story somewhat.However Christian Bale played a blinder again and he has definitely made the role his and his alone. Nobody would be able to compare to him. The ending was again a bit rushed and didn't really come as any surprise, and again this let down the overall film. Sets up another series, which would have to be exceptional to compare. But overall a let down and not a fitting end to this franchise. Let's hope the Man Of Steel (another DC offering) will strengthen the comic lines takings as the Green Lantern certainly didn't. Sorry, the Avengers will be the box office topper this year!"
tt0139414,"Good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.I like a crocodile movie, they don't even have to be giant-sized, they make really good ""monsters"", and the reality of their danger sits in the back of your head.The cast was great in this, though Bridget Fonda screams a lot, and I can't say it's very endearing.They do sort of a ""unlikely crew"" trope with this, but most of the movie is dedicated to trying to find the thing in one capacity or the other.I just feel they did a good job on everything all round, and while it's not phenomenal, part of me REALLY wants a re-make of this one."
tt0993846,"If this movie wasn't so outrageous mess up funny. It would be so unlikable to watch. In my opinion, should had been call, 'The Wolves of Wall Street'. Nobody has any morals balls in this movie as every character in this film is pretty greedy liars. They all felt like one-dimensional greed caricatures than human beings. Most of the character really need more well-rounded depth to them. Based on 2007's memoirs, true story of Jordan Belfort. The movie focus on Jordan (Leonardo DiCaprio) rise to a wealthy stockbroker through the use of corruption scams; while under the watchful eyes of the federal government in the 1990s. The black comedy directed by Martin Scorsese, is pretty well-made. Still, it really felt too much of a glamorization of the lifestyle, than a moral tale, in my opinion. It felt like lets show as much f*ck up things as we can for 2 hours, and then in the last few minutes, show the negative results of what happen. It was bit one-sided argument. It made the film seem a bit unrealistic, with how many crude things, these people could get away with. This movie will likely inspiring others to do the same mistakes, rather than teach them, not to do what Belfort did. After all, the real Belfort got paid for this movie, a million dollar and a cameo. Since 2013, the opening of this movie, Belfort hasn't pay enough money back to the victims of his crimes. The U.S. government is not holding Belfort in default of his payments, but it is unclear when the full amount of the mandated restitution will ever be paid by him. He's pretty much, got Scot free in his case, and that really sucks to hear, if he stole money from you. The acting is really alright. Leonardo DiCaprio can really put out the charm. He can also do the yelling, that he been known for. He wasn't afraid of going over the top with this. Still, this role wasn't anything new for him. After all, he played similar characters in both 2013's Great Gatsby and 2002's Catch Me if you can. Instead of playing it straight, he just went 100% crazy with this role with all the sex scenes and drug use. Honestly, with all the drug use, Jordan portray in the film doing, how is this guy even alive? The one person that deeply surprise me was Jonah Hill as his partner in crime, Donny Azoff. You really didn't see this type of acting coming from him. The supporting cast was pretty good for the most part. I have to say, while his premise on film is short, Matthew McConaughey as Mark Hanna, Jordan's mentor, was pretty memorable. The women characters were pretty typecast as trophy wives, money hungry girlfriends, or eye candy hookers, who mostly go around, full frontal nudity, or having sex. If they're not, doing that, they portray as bitchy gold-diggers with no sense of morals. Margot Robbie is a pretty face, but gees, she couldn't act. At the beginning of her presence, she had an Australian accent that made more sense since her aunt is British. Then,out of the blue, you hear this awful screeching New Yorker/New Jersey Guido accent that sounds like something out of Jersey Shore. She couldn't show depth in her character, if Martin Scorsese wanted to. It's really uncomfortable and offended how women were portray in the film. The only female character was somebody to root for, was Aunt Emma (Joanna Lumley), but she ain't no angel. I have to say, for men, at less, we got a counter-protagonist fighting against the antagonist Jordan in Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) who did wonderful in his role. He wasn't one-dimensional pencil pusher, Boy Scout. He was willing to go one on one with Jordan. The movie even have a somewhat moral character in Jordan's father, Max (Rob Reiner) who tries hard to get Jordan to live life, the right way, but always his son to make the mistakes, needed to grow. I love the idea, how Martin Scorsese film it, with the use of wide ends, slow motion and others to show the effects of the drugs or heavy party scenes. The movie really felt like it could had work in a 3D settling. I love how he aged the film for the infomercial sequence to make it look like something that came out in the 1990s. I love all the commercials footage used from Benihana to Steve Madden. The CGI in the film is a bit choppy. You can see, how bad, it was in the storm scenes, but there is rare mistakes made this film. Great use of establish music to set the mood of the film. The humor is a hit or miss. Some of them were really just crude like the homophobic, sexism and racism comments. While, others were pretty clever and funny. I love all the fourth wall jokes with Jordan gives lengthy explanations of Stockbroker terminology; only to drop it midway through. I love pop culture references like Moby Dick, Gordon Gekko, Freaks, James Bond, Willy Wonka and others. The movie had a cluster F-Bomb with 544 uses of the word. Some of them seem natural; while other seem oddly place. This film has the record for the most uses of the word in a fiction film. The movie is 3 hours long with its pacing. You can't really tell, with the pacing, due to not a lot of slow scenes. Still, there were few gags did go on way too much. You can cut the movie to 1hr and 30 minutes, and get the same results. I was deeply surprised, that this movie wasn't NC-17 with its strong sexual content, graphic nudity, drug use and language throughout, and for some violence. It's one of the movies that should be. Overall: Well-made movie that was kinda offended, but still watchable."
tt1375666,"Well, I didn't think it lived up to all the hype, but nonetheless it was still a pretty good film. I don't think the story came out quite the way Nolan had hoped, after working on it for over a decade. In my view the story is basically a combination of Vanilla Sky meets The Matrix, but really it ends up being less meaningful than both (A combination of the mystical waking dream and the matrix of consciousness). This is Nolan's version of Edgar Allan Poe's A Dream Within A Dream, or the like. However I don't think the film really comes across this way as well as it should, or especially, the way it was meant to.Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow- You are not wrong, who deem that my days have been a dream; Yet if hope has flown away in a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it therefore the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep- while I weep! O God! Can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! Can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream?The film overall feels forced and clunky, it lacks any kind of good rhythm. For me to see this film ranked in the top 15 films ever made according to the IMDb voters only goes to prove one thing; The IMDb top 250 list is good for nothing at all but a laugh.I thought Inception was pretty good. However pretty good is stretching it as far as I would ever go. This film is a long long way from great.7/10"
tt1375666,"""Inception"" might have been a better movie -- and would certainly have been more entertaining -- had writer/director Christopher Nolan not made his premise so complicated that the film had to spend its entire 2:25 running time explaining itself to its audience.Seriously, the exposition Never. Stops. There were literally moments during action sequences where one character would pause and explain what was going on to another character, which of course was a ham-fisted way of explaining it to us. But even with all of that aggressive exposition, the movie never does make a lot of sense. The result is a lot of busyness -- oh, there's always plenty of stuff going on -- that's nevertheless pretty boring because it's never clear what all of the busyness is for.Nolan has done this to us before. Who the hell came out of ""The Prestige"" with any clue what that movie was about? And even his more narratively coherent films (like ""The Dark Knight"") suffer from a lack of humor and a burden of philosophical pondering that the premises can't support. ""Inception"" is no exception (ha!). The movie is junk trying to disguise itself as something important and significant. How much more fun it would have been if it had just been content to be junk.Grade: C-"
tt1375666,"OK here goes. I'll prepare myself for an ass kicking.I finish watching this film thinking are you guys really watching the same film as me!!?? Does this film really deserve 9.1 out of 10??? (1st sept 2010).I found this film incredibly frustrating. So I guess at the start you learn what a cool concept the film is based on. Nice idea. Very interesting. So why take over 2hrs to get to the point!!?? I fell asleep twice whilst watching it and still managed to catch the end - not feeling that i'd missed anything important.I didn't really like the characters. In these films you tend to connect with as least ONE character but I didn't feel it here at all.So some of you like the FX?? Yeah that ONE scene they used in the trailer. The one they sold the film on.Oh yeah. The last rant....i cant stand films where they introduce rules and details that only apply in the next few scenes. It so annoying and predictable. They do that a lot in this film.So anyway. I left asking myself and the other people I saw this with why this film is so overrated and there are a lack of bad reviews about it. We concluded its one of these trendy films that are meant to be clever and intelligent. I think people will be afraid of saying bad points about this just in case it suggests that they don't understand the concept. I for one did understand it, I just didn't like it. I certainly don't think it deserves 9.1 out of 10.My suggestion....just go and rent Matrix or Minority Report or something like that. Clever, visually brilliant AND enjoyable."
tt0114369,"""Se7en"" is unique because of the extraordinary sympathy it manages to foster for its two main characters; it's unique because of its bleak, hopeless environment that serves as a symptom of civilization's general decline. It's strengthened by its brilliant performances capturing mostly decent people struggling to survive in the sewer without becoming tainted by it. The fictional John Doe would most likely agree with all these theoretical snapshots of despair - the difference comes in his psychopathic desire to come up with a plan that he thinks will solve it.Few forms of popular entertainment manage to afford the villain his say whilst still maintaining a sensible distance from his horrific acts. What I like best is the film's depressing contention that there isn't as much distinction as we think between the good guys and the bad guys. We're all affected by the distasteful aspects of society, but do we just hope that our own positive contributions will be enough to offset them - or in extreme situations, when we stare into the abyss, will the abyss stare back at us?Some may well be upset that the killer's justification contains reasoned objections. It is really only by resorting to crime that he reveals himself as a madman. Rather than be outraged, though, I prefer to celebrate good writing that allows us to see hidden facets of an issue, however unpalatable the resultant consequences of such a viewpoint may turn out to be."
tt7286456,"Great movie with a political message, and it deserves an Oscar.Great story and acting, the only downside is there's a bit of boredom at the beginning of the movie."
tt0361748,"(No spoilers.) Lawrence Bender (Tarantino's Producer since Reservoir Dogs) in an interview about Inglorious Basterds said that it had the layers of Pulp Fiction but with more maturity, because, in fairness, Quentin's had 15 years to grow, learn and develop, although his last two outings of Death Proof and Kill Bill showed little sign of the writer/Director maturing, merely stamping his mark on genres that weren't in the spotlight, and in some ways, recreating them.So, did Inglorious Basterds live up to this claim of the new and matured Quentin Tarantino? Well, yes and no. Tarantino's staple dialogue, when not pushing a story, is often crude. That, for once, is not the case with Inglorious Basterds, so perhaps that can be taken as a sign of maturity. The dialogue is excellent, as expected, but at times without the poetic rhythm that his first three pictures had in abundance. The only drawback of this is that on rare occasions you'll find that you've zoned out for a moment, but, with a Tarantino film, you can be pretty damn sure that you'll be seeing it a few times anyway and you'll be able to catch up on missed dialogue. It is dialogue heavy, which today's audience seem to shy away from, but for me personally, I love to see a film driven by its script rather than its special effects.The story is layered in true Tarantino fashion. I do feel that the Basterds themselves could have been developed more, since there are many and we get to know so few, however this isn't a small film like Reservoir Dogs, revolving around a group of Basterds as the trailer makes out, and there are plenty of wonderful characters to compensate for it.Also, as we've come to expect, the film is violent, which I didn't think would bother me, but it's the only thing that left a slightly bitter taste in my mouth. I'm pretty desensitised to violence on screen and have been for many years, but I expected the violence of Inglourious Basterds to be understandable under the topic of War. I also expected a few points to emphasise the cruelty and senseless of war, but I found that in many ways this was a glorification of war and Quentin has used it as a playing field for his imagination without considering the consequences. As Uncle Ben taught us in Spiderman, ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and when I was going into Inglourious Basterds, I felt that the uneducated audience who love Tarantino might leave this film having learnt a few things. Sadly, I don't feel that is the case, and for me that is its only downfall. It's becoming more and more obvious that Quentin Tarantino makes the films that Quentin Tarantino wants to see, and while that is precisely why they're so good, I do find that if he was a little less self indulgent he could make something just as hip, funky, violent and entertaining, but with more depth.However, as a crafted piece of work, in script, style and care, it fires on all cylinders. I do not believe that a Tarantino film will ever not live up to the standards we've come to expect and I honestly feel that he is the most reliable director in the world today, but I can't help feeling that while people are calling this a more mature piece of work, the reality is that his first two ventures on the big screen were in fact more mature and with less glorified violence than what he is making now.Be that as it may, he is one of the few Director's who I feel is really worthy of the title 'Artist', and if somebody is an Artist then they should be free to make what they want. Tarantino is fortunate enough to be able to make what he wants without being hampered by producers, and I suppose in the end, I wouldn't want it any other way.So check it out when you can and see what you think.Peace."
tt0167261,"i read the first book before i saw the film last year, and was dissapointed with ""the fellowship of the ring"" on first viewing. Then on second viewing, i found it very good, and on third viewing i became a lover of the film. I started to read the second book but like a lot of people who have tried to read them, only managed to get half way through. The book became too hard to read, with tolkien becoming more and more descriptive, and beatifully poetic, but taking an awful long time to get the story going. So i stopped reading it.Now, the film is out. And i hoped i wouldn't lose interest at the similair point in the film. Luckily i didn't. Peter Jackson intertwines each of the three different storylines well, one of which becomes a little too less focused on. And the film does take a while to gather some steam. But when it does it is damn well worth it. Yes, some of the effects are a little ""crap"" for lack of a better word. Well too be fair, only one little negative to the effects, and you'll all see it when you watch the film. And it's not gollum either. And also a scene that is unintentionally funny, which maybe us brits will only gringe at. Anyway, Gollum enters the scene, and i did groan and think oh no, it looks too fake. But after a short while, when it closes in on his character, he does look fantastic. And at times, very very funny and very very evil. And everyone is saying blah blah helms deep battle, best thing you'll ever see blah blah. It isn't the best thing you will ever see, by no means, but it is absolutely fanbloodytastic. More in the mood and the build, with the rain and the distant footsteps of the approaching army. And that is only one of three brilliantly depicted battles. All the performances are good, nothing oscar worthy, and if orlando bloom gets another nomination, i'll be so damn angry. He didn't do anything in the first film, yet ""best newcomer"", why?. Anyway, he was good, but so was everybody else. Overall, just another great part to a film that can only truly be judged when all three are on dvd."
tt0068646,"Overrated movie that romanticizes the mafia. Script is average, the performances and scenography are good, but they don't wash away the weak script. Don Vito Corleone is just a romanticized and unbelievable mob boss."
tt0102926,"... but I personally do not see why the note is above 8 and why many consider it as a classic.I watched first Red dragon and it is more interesting than this one.At times I was even a bit bored. And could not help to notice that it looked like X files and Scully...Anyway, it is not a bad movie, but nothing special for me either.I give it 6,4."
tt0109830,"I found this an entertaining movie to watch, nothing more, nothing less. I have one major reason for being negative about this film: it portrays a man who is able to attain the 'American Dream' without any intelligence. However much we can admire him for that, I'm afraid that the message being sent out is that you don't need education or smarts and that everything will come to you as if laid by a golden goose. Surely this is not what the movie makers intended but that's the way it came across on me.Besides that I must say that Tom Hanks does an excellent acting job, and for that alone the film is actually worth watching...but not a classic."
tt0120815,"Smug liberal Spielberg toggles back and forth between documentary style violence and sentimental reflections between soldiers: the Captain is revealed to be an English Lit teacher in civilian life who can instruct the novice writer character and others with idealised rhetoric about both the unique contribution each can make to the mission as well as their ability to choose at will a vision/memory of ""the good life"" back home worth fighting for: this emphasis upon individual freedom detracts from shared debate among the men about both the worthiness of the mission to save one guy, and the larger reasons for American involvement in the war. This deflates any anti- war sentiment in the film. Significantly, Ryan is the sole survivor who must, alone in the cemetery (predictably, his accompanying family are as silent as his fallen comrades), decide/hope he was ""a good man"" worthy of their sacrifice. In this emotional lynchpin of the movie, Spielberg suggestively cuts to Old Glory flapping in the wind: the link drawn between liberal pluralism/individual choice and the symbol of America remains an insidious and powerful ideological moment, equalled only by the title character in ""Schindler's List"" who had the power to choose who would live or die. Consistently in his historical revisionist pieces, Spielberg suggests this is the only kind of freedom worth fighting for, with no awareness of how it merely compounds the tragedy."
tt0137523,"David Fincher's dark, brooding assault on the senses employs much of the same style as he used in SEVEN, to great effect. This is a complex, intelligent film which, for a change, doesn't take the viewer for granted. A big streak of black comedy runs through the centre, making things a bit easier to cope with, but it's still a morose, disturbing film, a good film, yes, but not one which makes you feel good after watching it.The plot twists and turns continually, from beginning to end. Things start off on a relatively small scale to become outrageous and explosive at the film's finale. There's also one of those very-clever twists at the end, so favoured by the likes of THE USUAL SUSPECTS. There is plenty of sick humour, the highlight being the hilarious scene involving the liposuction fat - you'll know it when you see it.With a film like this, the acting has to be brilliant, and it frequently is. Edward Norton excels as the narrator of the story, caught up in all the madness, and it's a multi-faceted, psychologically-focused performance. Brad Pitt doesn't really stretch himself but he fits the bill well and isn't afraid to put off his female fans by appearing broken and bloodied in a film like this. Other actors, ranging from Meat Loaf to Jared Leto, are also very good.The violence is extremely brutal and unglamourised. Heads are knocked hard against concrete, acid is poured over flesh, teeth are knocked out, and noses are split open. This is a hard film to watch, but fascinating at the same time. Fiendishly clever and highly suspenseful, I would rate FIGHT CLUB as one of the best films of 1999 - on par with THE SIXTH SENSE, and just under my favourite, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. Buy it, rent it, steal it, but be prepared: you won't be the same afterwards."
tt0137523,"After all the discrete, awful, painful, sequences with too much blood and gore, and real buzz-kill sheet scenes where Brad Pitt, wearing boxing gloves, or surgical gloves, humping the washed-up chain-smoker. I thought there must be something more than a deus ex machina in the end, something thrilling and enlightening that somehow makes the movie worthy of the suffering.But no. Brace yourself for the catastrophic collapses near the end, it's basically the routine deus ex machina that explains everything by startling the protagonist out of reverie, things went awry when the narrator and Brad Pitt merged into one, a most implausible schizophrenic, who contradicts almost the whole plot line before this ham-fisted twist. Then this eerie double personality talked directly to the audience from David Fincher's perspective -- now it's a holy trinity of them -- ""It's called a changeover, the movie goes on and nobody in the audience has any idea.""I'd have hurled myself at the screen if I had been old enough to go and see and understand it in a cinema.Besides, I have little idea what the novel by Chuck Palahniuk is about, I tried to give it a whirl but it kinda strengthened my belief that stream of consciousness should be solidified before written down, the ill-punctuated text rendered me brain damaged."
tt0137523,"""How many nihilists does it take to change a light-bulb?"" ""-Half."" (Gettit?)Fight Club(1999) is a highly stylised hybrid--a pitch-black comedy that's hard to like unless you're male, and (possibly) clawing your way BACK from the edge of abyss.It opens with a CGI-fly-past of firing neurons under the credits, suggesting what follows is caused by misfires in the protagonist's brain. But you miss that at first for all the uncharted territory.James Uhls' impressive screen adaptation continues Chuck Palahniuk's novel attempts to revolutionize men's views of their place in first-world-societies where caveman sensibilities are literally no longer required.Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt) characterizes our generation in one of his early Fight Club welcome speeches: ""We're the middle children of history--we have no Great War"", meaning that men raised without brutality still crave it--and why so many of them eagerly join up. But Club(1999) delineates its message for just one gender, never pretending to speak for women: the narrator observes that before becoming yuppies, ""we used to read pornography"": young girls were never so inclined.Nevertheless, it's frightening how many people the film appeals to. Fans over-enthuse, saying ""this is the BEST movie EVER"". Professional critics aren't so impressed. One courageous video & DVD guide claims that ""...this appalling, grotesque, and interminable endurance-test is fairytale fiction for serial killers, imbeciles who succumb to road rage, and frustrated white guys--all the morons who seek excuses for their increasingly bad behavior and hair-trigger tempers"".This temper-thing in the psych business is called ""sham-rage"" (or ""decortication"" after the severing of the neocortex in 1948 experiments on pussycats)- www.emotion.caltech.edu/courses/ss140/April17-1.pdf. The ""misfire"" in Jack's brain depicts such a neurochemical break.But maybe Jack(Ed Norton) and Tyler(Brad Pitt) have a point. To me, the movie is saying that ""frustrated"" guys are really no good for women, because, frankly, they just don't want what women have to give. Such men might now want to bond only with each other, to satisfy ancient caveman instincts, which civilisation--and women--are trying to breed out of them.That's why Jack & Tyler's fight clubs quickly evolve into organised anarchism, and eventually nihilism--the wish to destroy all moral and social edifices: males are getting back to their roots.Having ""said"" that, Fight Club(1999) tries to throw a lifeline to the seriously disaffected; but that lifeline falls on deaf ears. (*****Spoiler: The ending depicts Jack's retaking control from his ""teacher"" by redefining his personal limits regarding violence. The protagonist successfully battles his delusion to finally regain himself. He has learnt better.*****) The ""nasty"" existentialism of anarchism/nihilism still tends to appeal to young men, despite its dead-end logic. A recent email asked me whether I thought this ""philosophy of unreason"" was a mental deficiency or a choice. I call it a deficiency, as Fight Club(1999) does; the question is only how permanent that is. It can be considered foolishness--which is unlearnable; or sociopathy--which isn't.It's nice to know even its proponents (like my email friend) think this ""unreason"" is subject to cognitive override--choice--but why would anyone choose it unless their unreason validates some physiological syndrome? Anti-establishment anarchism was last big in the 19thC, having FIRST given rise to Machiavelli. During both periods it was a might-makes-right power struggle against ruling elites. We now think of these periods as callous, brutal and primitive, certainly not part of civilisation today. We expect ""civilians"" to abide by higher universal standards of humanism. Clearly, blowing up buildings and bashing each other half to death is antithetical to that social contract.However, I do like the film's position that male bonding, with/without a sexual component, might be just what they need. During a bonding session with Tyler, as they consider Jack's heterosexual relationship, Jack admits, ""I can't get married; I'm a 30yr-old boy""--to which Tyler adds, ""We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we need"".This is gender politics; and Norton goes to great lengths on the commentary track to explain Jack's mistreatment of Marla (Helena Bonham-Carter) as symptomatic of Jack's social and mental incompetence. Misogyny itself, the male hatred of women, may be physiologically inspired in such boy-men struggling to behave civilly. Ancient reptilian brain-structures produce the primal urge to violence (ie just to feel alive), so fight-club violence might not be caused by ""social malaise"" at all.I suspect this is the movie's--and novel's--most unpalatable basis, making Fight Club(1999) seem ""irresponsible"" to its critics.We usually call reptilian brain-structures ""primitive"" because except in lizards (hence ""lizard-logic""), they're buried deep in the brain, overlain by ""higher"", mammalian brain-structures. Lifelong learning encapsulated in the neocortex of, say, pussycats, inhibits/overrides this reptilian dominance, but in some (""decorticated"" pussycats or people) the process may be faulty, or just take too long. However if graduating beyond such lizard-logic (anarchist idiocy) takes ""fight-clubbers"" most of their lifetime, then so be it--until then, such men are welcome to have s*x with each other.Fight Club(1999)'s main problem is that it stirs up the powerful philosophical issue of anarchism/nihilism, but leaves it unresolved, notably with its ending. The entire closing scene, including the bombing, is visually nebulous. Did all that happen, or was it just Jack's imagination? Comprehension is deliberately muddied by Jack's speedy recovery(!) from a fatal gunshot wound. Like many, I laughed at its absurdity.Yet the film's showmanship still wins new converts. It seems to set the benchmark for neocinema by demanding freeze-frame plus several viewings to build its enjoyment. Like Sixth Sense(1999), Club(1999) employs perception-shift for the lead character, but here it's integrated linearly to unfold the story. (In Sense(1999) the perception-shift is recursive- cf. www.cse.nd.edu/courses/cse233/www/lectures/ri.pdf OR http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node15.html.)Club(1999) further winks at us with single-frame interjections of--supposedly--Tyler's full frontals throughout Jack's narration. They serve both as alerts to Jack's insanity, and as visual ""easter-eggs"".Other clever concepts are borrowed from social philosophy, eg the politics of rich women's fat-paranoia (soapmaking): true recycling, tr√©s Soylent Green(1973).---END_OF_PART1---"
tt0108052,"It's a great movie and i recommended it to anyone who wants to see a beautiful film about the great tragedies of the holocaust. This film's only ""bad thing"" is that it's in black and white but this believe it or not gives it even more beauty. I think that this movie is suitable for kids 12 and up if they are watching it with their parents. Also remember that is film is based on a true story. Schindler was a man who helped the Nazis in many ways (suplying weapons etc)but he did not think that what was being done to the Jews was right so he helped many of them who are still alive today and many who left their children to tell the story."

tt0480025,It makes you happy it makes you sad it makes you laugh it makes you cry but you wouldn't expect anything more from Shane Meadows superb director. He has the Talent to get the right actors and I'm not giving it 10 just because the house in the film was just down the road from me.. just take a look at Dead Man's Shoes by Shane Meadows definitely would recommend
tt0108052,"a gripping story, with beautiful shots, and a direction of master himself. a story that takes you to the lane of past and force you to feel that pain and go through their journey. that's the beauty of cinema.. loved it. everything was looking so good, whether acting, music, sound, cinematography, editing. everything was so fantastic. specially the colors,and how they use the contrast of that red blazer, to show the authenticity and pain of those people, the helplessness of those. There are some of the most true and graphic scenes here ever captured on celluloid. People being shot for no particular reason, hiding in fear, stripped and gased, abused......so much so that viewers watching it for the 1st time will be deeply affected."
tt0068646,"You can't really criticize a film like ""The Godfather"", especially from a younger-type guy like me. Since its release in 1972, ""The Godfather"" has been highly praised by fans universally. It's extremely hard for a person who has never seen ""The Godfather"" without having high expectations because millions of people, maybe more have been talking about how wonderful it is. But as a film critic who has seen the movie several times and has read the novel that it was based on by Mario Puzo, this movie really deserves the credibility it gets. It really is that special. The film is a gripping epic that indulges the viewer with plenty of unsuspecting twists and a plot that works in a multitude of dimensions. The mobster's depicted here face many trials and tribulation that involve marriage, favours, family struggles, turncoats, tragic events, violence and rigor mortis.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head patriarch and kingpin of his esteemed enterprise is acquainted to at his daughter's wedding, which is a special occurrence in Italian tradition (Sicilian in particular) where the father of the bride is to refrain from offering the groom any special favours. His representatives showing their signs of respect towards the Don are featured in the opening scenes are told through their ways of personal address and greeting regimentations. The Don is to be treated with respect and dignity, a man who follows his own frame of mind to what is fair, and will likely deny any means of avenge. As an example, if anyone was to fondle with his daughter in any kind of way grounds for murder. It's not revenge, as long as your daughter's still breathing.There are also numerous facets that indicate how not so respected the Don really is. Vito comes from the old school of Mafia, and can be labeled as a ""Moustache"" Pete. For one, unlike his adversaries, he refuses to get involved with drugs or smuggling for that matter. It this is much to the chagrin of other rival mob units in the state of New York. The violence is described disturbingly as nothing personal, it's just business. The philosophy behind this organized crime is chilling, but quite convincing. The violence is creepily accepted and sometimes happens all of the sudden. Suddenly, the Corleone enterprise falls on its foundations, and it's up to the next generation to restore the family so it could be ranked as the top of the best mob families.The cast features a myriad of talented performers each playing their respective roles flawlessly. The top stars like Brando as Vito, James Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Al Pacino as the likable Michael, John Cazale as middle-sibling Fredo, Robert Duvall as mob attorney Tom Hagen, Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio and Diane Keaton as Kay Adams are what I may have expected what the characters from Puzo's book look like physically. Even the smaller roles deserve special credit. The performances were absolutely amazing. The characters in the film compliment the characters from the novel and it is mainly due to the physical structuring and the carefully planned interpretation.The novel this movie was based on by Mario Puzo deserves praise in itself. Even though this movie was a fictional, there are a lot of authentic features that make every scene and every chapter to be real. I guess people when they think of mob bosses they visualize a supreme Don, sitting in his chair with a long facial expression contemplating with endless level-headedness and leadership. ""The Godfather"" is a marvel from both the film and the novel and it is hard to determine what medium is the better of the two.If there is one thing that the book is better would be character development. Al Pacino's Michael Corleone is a more prominent character in the novel than in the movie. Michael's transformation in the movie is at times a bit rushed, while in the book it's handled more gradual. The other character Luca Brasi played by Lenny Montana was a more vital character in the novel, which while he was an ally to the Corleone clan, is marked as a threatening adversary with a dark and dreary secret. In the movie comes across as a big oaf, and not as scary. It's also nice that some of the smaller characters from the novel have engaging back stories like Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden). But that's good for the novel's sake, while the film would result in overdone detailing.Overall, ""The Godfather"" is one of the greatest films ever made. Thanks mainly to the crew for creating a well-structured setting that compliments nicely to the characters, the script and most importantly, the direction of Francis Ford Coppola. Hats off to the cinematography from Gordon Willis which is backed nicely by the elegant score from Nino Rota and Carlo Savina. This film truly defines the words ""required viewings."""
tt0313792,"In 1977, comedian Woody Allen created a masterpiece. Annie Hall is one of the few films ever made that the word 'perfection' can be accurately attributed to. Everything about the film is great, and it is most definitely the director's masterpiece. However, despite some very nice films; Allen has never managed to recapture that brilliance that lead to him creating Annie Hall, and the rest of his filmography can split into two parts; films that work and films that don't. While Anything Else doesn't change this, it fits firmly into the 'films that work' of Allen's film credits, and it's nice to see the man doing the sort of stuff that he does best. Anything Else is a film that very firmly fits into Woody Allen's familiar style, and it deals with his favourite topic - relationships, and it's set in his favourite city - Manhattan. The story follows a young New York couple, the male (Jason Briggs) of the pair being a comedy writer who becomes friends with another comedy writer (Woody Allen), 39 years his senior. We then follow the man as he makes various decisions about his life.You can always count on Woody Allen to gather up a good ensemble cast, and he hasn't disappointed here. The biggest surprise in the movie is the casting of Jason Briggs. The young actor famous for his role in the American Pie Trilogy does really well in his role; and it shows both his talent and Allen's for getting a good performance out of him. Starring alongside Briggs is Christina Ricci. Allen makes best use of her bitchy side, and she is very believable in her role. Danny DeVito appears also; he's an actor I normally like to see, and rounding off the cast, as in all great Allen flicks, is the man himself; who plays the same character that we're used to seeing. A small element of the cast that I personally very much enjoyed seeing was Erica Leerhsen. This very sexy lady only appears for about five minutes; but they're five very good minutes! The film falls down on some aspects, such as the fact that the ending feels very rushed; but on the whole, it's an interesting, funny and engaging drama with a good cast that's helmed by a man who knows how to make movies. Recommended."
tt0133093,"..I reckon it's aimed for a certain type of viewers.I love Action, Sci-fi, and so on; However, and believe me I have tried, never found that greatness that many were on about after its release.Therefore, I just cannot get all the cult movement it created afterward (black coats, tattoos, slang,...) For me it was a very original film, nice fights (although the effects were not all that) and just average interpretations from the cast with the exception of the always effective Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) and little more.I would not recommend it to those who do not have an open mind for fantasy and Sci-fi.Hope this was useful!"
tt0342804,"If not for bumping into the filmmaker at another SXSW Film Festival screening, I would have dismissed this as potentially a tear-jerker freak show.  The synopsis did not grab me.  Mr. Karsh did--he is as passionate as his subject matter.Don't make the mistake I almost made--see this and prepare to meet some of the most indelibly etched characters life has ever created on screen. HBO/Cinemax has apparently agreed to pick this up for showing in late 2003/early 2004 so you should have a chance to see it there, but I really hope it finds release on DVD.Karsh creates and incredibly moving portrait of a family like no other, built on the solid foundation of one amazing mother.  With an engaging, suspenseful dramatic arc that could not possibly have been scripted, the film shows laughter, fear, anger, rage, love, frustration and difficult resolution.  As in any family, there are no easy answers to life's daily challenges.  With unique access and a ""cast"" of dreams, it is an absolutely unforgettable slice of life that should make each of us aware of how much we have for which to be thankful.  Part documentary, part cinema verite, it is 100% engaging till the last frame.  See it and prepare to meet the Toms."
tt1375666,"It is obvious people do enjoy psychological thrillers, virtual reality, and Leonardo DiCaprio. Inception, having it all, will astonish and marvel crowds of cinema goers into thinking they are smart and profound just for getting or liking the movie. I have to say, I admire the movie's performance into tricking its viewers like that; because that's what it is, a trick. A dream within a dream, and doesn't that sound attractive...It is the kind of movie that gets nominated for Oscar just for its crowd pleasing abilities, and Oscars are born within the capitalist world and needs all the capital it can get. Just like Avatar got nominated in the ""best movie"" category... I've read some review saying Inception could be the movie of the decade; obviously, the guy didn't see that many movies in the last ten years; there are better movies in 2010 only, and a bunch of them.I'm not saying the movie is bad; it's a good movie for its genre; what I didn't like about it is the fuss it created (and that fuss will disappear like it disappeared before for other crowd adored films), but mostly its lack of authenticity, therefore its PRETENTIOUSNESS.This is not a gem - it is a pile of dust in the eyes."
tt0109830,"Forrest Gump (1994) is one of the greatest Oscar Winning Movies. It won Best Picture, Best VFX, Best Director (Robert Zemeckis), Best Actor (Tom Hanks) and Best Film Editing. It was one of the best films I have ever seen.
Forrest Gumps casted Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, Robin Wright as Jenny Curran, Gary Sinises as Lieutenant Dan Taylor and more. First of all, the acting was extremely excellent, Tom Hanks could act like a stupid guy and he actually won an Oscar for that. It was really impressive.
The story was really good. Starting the time when there was president John F. Kennedy and there was was in Vietnam (my country, it made me so proud of having Vietnam in such a good movie). It was an Alabama man with an IQ of 75. I could imagine that being Forrest Gump was the greatest thing. Bullied, called stupid is fine, many people though it would make you an outcast.
This was such a good movie that some day I want to see it again and again and again. The scenes are really unforgettable with humor and tragedy. I laughed and cried (whenn Jenny and Bubba are dead). It was the most unforgettable movie ever.
Well, I had nothing left to say. Forrest Gump is a must-see. A 9.4/10"
tt0120737,"Beautiful costumes, great set design, casting, costumes, and special effects.  It also happens to be veeeeerrry long and more than a little boring.  The second best movie ever? Not even close.  The 250 best movies at IMDB is the weirdest list I've ever seen."
tt0167260,"The expectations that were built up by the first film, and the second (allthough slowed down), really plunged down into the lava of Mnt Doom with this one. It really makes you nauseous thinking about everything that is wrong in this film (I'm not talking about the extended version, that one is a lot better - but still far from perfect) and how everything could have been.Where should I start?...... It's overly sentimental. I mean really. And I like that s*** usually - I'm a sentimental guy. But here it's really out of proportion, and out of timing. Oh, it's really sad when Faramir rides to meet the orcs when he has no chance of winning, while Pippin is singing som silly song like he's castrated and then breaks out and cries just like that. Bu-hu, this is a mythological-style heroic fantasy-tale, not... Titanic! Everybody are so overly emotional. And I don't even wanna talk about Sam and his constant speeches about bravery and not giving in, with the hand on the chest, looking out over the horizon, with the orchestra at full volume (the only thing missing is the American flag bellowing in slowmotion behind him), and Frodo and his constant twisting-your-head-like-a-puppy-and-looking-with-big-eyes-and-a-""OH-I-love-you-so-much""-smile at Sam every time he saves him or helps him to keep going... OK I'm getting carried away....I liked Braveheart for example, even though it has some major flaws. And people think THAT one is overly sentimental. But that one is at least down to earth-sentimental. RotK is up in the sky, almost gone out to space, like (I thought I'd never say this, but), it seems they (producers, crew and actors) really take the film TOO serious. Really. It's a Saga! Not true. It's a 20th-century, made up mythology-history about an IMAGINARY land. It's NOT a record of the Holocaust for Christ's sake!...I understand how they needed to cut some scenes, to save up time. but, well... First of all, they didn't succeed enough with that, the films are 2-3h long and still it feels you're rushing from one place to the next, like you're on a Middleearth-8hour-safari or... cinematic tourbus. Maybe they should've cut it even more, so we could at least get the feel of BEING someplace and not just passing by? But what's really unacceptable is when he wastes all that preciously gathered time on exploring uninteresting or unimportant scenes and scenes that don't even belong in the story! Completely made up-scenes, for no logical reason!*The ugly made-up bull/rhinoceros-beasts pulling orc-wagons (whatta F--- is up with that? I don't even know if George Lucas would accept such a badly designed creature in the Star Wars universe!)... *The really AWFUL orc liutenant/chief-guy, who's by the way made up out of thin air, who doesn't even look like an orc but more like the aliens from Peter Jackson's early lowbudget cult-films (Mr. Jackson, this is NOT the time and place to have cameos, or draw funny parallells to your Bad Taste-films, that's really... bad taste... disrespectful to the Tolkien-fans)... *The M√ªmaks are really cool, but really too big, I mean, they're not dinosaurs-beasts - hey're just big elephants! *All the small details, costumes and armour etc. are really beautiful, really more than you could ever ask for. But the White Dwarf-miniature-esthetics of Minas Tirith is really bad, cause it gives a whole synthetic-comic-book/computer-game-look to Middleearth. Where are the beautiful, classical and authentic designs of Edoras and Rivendell? And no catapult can throw rocks as big as whole houses! That too is just corny and childish like in computergames. All this, and the excessive use and naive belief in CGI-technology, turns the Battle of Pelenoor Fields, which should be the total culmination and action-peak of the film into a foney uninteresting StarWars/Warhammer40000-mess, it's nothing compared to the battle of helm's deep - and that's not right.And this CGI-trend seems to be a virus infecting everybody in the film-business. It's really sad, these films will be outdated in 10 years. But maybe that's a good thing?RotK isn't the worst of the three, technically. But with the expectations you have from the first two, the books (if you know what's gonna happen), the demands should be pretty high; and, in my opinion too, especially after the hint in 2towers that the trilogy was going downhill (just like the matrix), this is the film that disappoints the most. RotK is the greatest and heaviest of the films, the first two would completely crumble under it's weight if it didn't hold, but they could also rise with it if it really grew as strong as it could've, and that is what it should have. Anything else is unacceptable to me, and this is also why I hate it. Cause it really doesn't live up to it's potential, it doesn't even outdo the 2towers and it doesn't live up to the old exited expectations you had from the first film.I can't understand how a New Zeelander, who used to make underground films could turn this old British tale into shimmering Hollywood-cheese. It's too pretty, too pompous and sentimental and all the computer graphics gives it lika a fake sugarcoated shine or crust.It's like food, add too many ingredients and spices and they'll take out each other and the dish'll just taste bland... It's just too much of everything, and the whole film falls flat. It's still stunning, but rather tasteless, and the only profound experience you might get from it comes soely from the overwhelming magnitude of the whole thing.I still wanna congratulate P.Jackson on successfully bringing this gigantic project home. Thank him, even if he's made me more irritated than delighted, cuz I'm still glad that I'm able to watch these films. He didn't deserve all those Oscars, but he definitely deserved a few, maybe not for directing, but for Best Film - for the production. But this film should NOT be ranked as the best fantasy-film of all time! /Sebastian"
tt0993846,"Basically, a waste of time and an insult to my intelligence. One star for being in color, a second star for all the great looking girls, okay a third star for Leonardo, but offset this by a negative star for glamorizing drug addition and irresponsible wealth (yes it did!). I expect a movie to either entertain me or emotionally move me. This did neither. I know the drug usage and corruption for the sake of money was meant to be revolting, but instead it came across as being painted as desirable. Sorry to see such talent wasted on this. I'm guessing the book/script must have had more appeal than actually seeing this as a film."
tt0993846,"I'm sorry to say but for the first time, the critics were pretty spot on with this. The acting performances of both Leonardo DeCaprio and Jonah Hill were top notch and most definitely worthy of the accolades they have received, but the movie it self seemed like it was on massive quantities of drugs. It was a great story, but it was told in such a choppy manner, some of the scenes were so over the top I felt like I was watching another Tucker Maxx movie. I was really hoping for more. Great acting (Rob Reiner deserved an Oscar nomination too)...OK movie...and it was WAY too long!!! I don't know how he did it, but Scorsese managed to drag this out for almost 3 full hours. He couldn't do a 3 hour version of Goodfellas or The Departed, but managed to extend the life of this for 3 hours? Again, I was really hoping for more."
tt0361748,"I really don't like this movie. I think right now I'm rating it like a 2 or 3. I haven't seen ""Death Proof"" but I think I've seen all the other ones he's directed and this is definitely the worst. In fact his films have been getting worse all the time and the last respectable thing he did was ""Jackie Brown"" as far as I'm concerned. I'm pretty much through with him. His credit is totally gone with me. As far as I can tell he makes movies to feed the fantasies of 14 year old boys. It seems like his early movies were fun and different, even if they used a lot of stuff from older movies they put it together in a different way. But this movie and ""Kill Bill"", these are just stupid movies to me. Pornography of violence basically.There's something to be said for the old exploitation movies. I'm not entirely ignorant on this subject. He used a lot of ideas from the B-crime movies of the 50s with ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"", and then he did I guess his version of ""blaxpoloitation"" with ""Jackie Brown."" But the thing is, that movie was made with respect to black people. It's not even really a blaxploitation movie at all, just a decent modern caper movie that uses music from the 70s movies. But with this ""Inglorious Basterds"" thing, it's really like he's trying to make his own ""Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS"" movie. But he's trying to have his cake by making it ""Ilsa, She Wolf of the Jewish resistance."" And ultimately he just presents this sad tableau where every character and every scene is dehumanized and dehumanizing. If he had actually wanted to make a movie that would have entertained Hitler, he couldn't have done better.I want to give this movie points for being different, but how can you reward somebody just for being worse than others, for daring to go further into violence for the sake of violence and justifying it with some lame-arse stuff like ""oh they're all Nazis, who cares what happens to Nazis?"" It's still dehumanizing in my opinion, it debases us to be encouraged to fantasize about committing this kind of violence to anyone. Movies like this are what makes me scared for the future of America, which I love dearly. Don't try to say that the ""Basterds"" are presented in some kind of negative light, or the film is a parody of American Exceptionalism. That's just an excuse that Tarantino built into the film with a few throw-away lines like ""watching the Jew Bear bash a Nazi is the closest thing we get to a movie."" Just to be self conscious about using violence and hate as a cinematic value (like the most base and disgusting exploitation films Tarantino apparently adores in a different way than I ever could) is not to justify it, not even in an aesthetic sense."

tt0120815,"This is one of the single worst films I have ever seen.  Spielberg was, once again, intoxicated by his own sense of patriotic splendour. The first major flaw in this film struck me the first time I saw it.  I was in the theater and began to ask myself, ""How could Ryan remember the D-Day invasion when in fact he was never there?""Now, honestly, how did Spielberg expect to get away with that one? It was never explained or followed up in any way. Secondly, how did he expect to get away with portraying the Germans as mindless, blood-thirsty grunts?  ""Well they were, weren't they?"" says the blindly patriotic american.  This aspect of the film is a disgrace to Germans and more importantly to the brain-washed americans. Finally, I would just like to point out the fact that this was not a war to rescue individual men in order to preserve their family line. This film makes a mockery of WWII by completely misrepresenting it.  The only aspect that was accurately portrayed was the violence, which sadly enough drew many people to the film. Two thumbs down!"
tt0133093,"... but considering the quality of writing these days, it won't return again for awhile.  This film requires the usual sci-fi suspension of disbelief but has several things going for it:  the characters are actually developed in a detective-movie-noirish way, the hero and others struggle with decisions and THEN act, as opposed to JUST doing something, and most obviously the film has a color-and-costuming visual style that remains a bold statement throughout the production.This is a film that chronicles the style of the turn of this century in the same way that ""Georgy Girl"" caught the London of the 1960's, and that ""Laura"" captured the deco-elegant look of the 1940's."
tt0109842,"""Fresh"" has one amazingly powerful scene I had never forgotten. In it, the titular Fresh, a twelve-year-old boy who works as a drug smuggler, also has a crush on a girl called Rosie. Some men are playing basketball nearby, in which a much younger player is running rings around a young man who is getting more and more fed up. Fresh is tossing up whether or not to approach Rosie, then she approaches him - and then the aggravated young man pulls out a gun and starts shooting.Can anyone forget that scene?Besides that, the movie is pretty good, but for me it was held back by a plot that was just too hard to follow. It's one of those things where you keep hearing characters' names, but don't know which name belongs to which character.I got that Fresh becomes more calculating by the end of the movie. Is it supposed to be that everything he's been through leading up to that has hardened him? The kid that plays Fresh gives a captivating performance, but sometimes I found myself wondering how likely his behaviour is. It wasn't so much that his character developed. It was more like he stopped being believable as a character and turned into a plot device.I will say one last thing: ""Fresh"" is very different as a '90s hood movie in that it doesn't feature wall-to-wall hip hop music. That really makes it stand out."
tt7286456,"I feel like I am missing something with this film. Having heard so many plaudits I was looking forward to finally seeing it but I just feel empty after viewing it.The film touched on so many current issues but explored none in any detail. Mental health, bullying, abuse, class, anarchy but it was all barely touching the surface. Meanwhile Arthur's character I felt didn't really change much. He just went from troubled and weak to troubled but armed with a gun - so he could suddenly fight back... there was no moment of realisation when he somehow decided to be proactive or take control.That really seemed to be the character development done. We saw nothing at all of the making of a mastermind criminal. Nothing preplanned. No learning curve. No real agency in what was happening.Parts I liked, or thought well done. For example it was bleak and depressing presumably as intended, so in a way it was atmospheric - it was in that way a believable world except that every now and then something unlikely would occur (stealing a advertising board - why? Police not following up investigations, tv clips, lack of security in a dangerous world). The end result was it ceased to feel real even as the direction went for gritty.The other problem was the tropes, his (obvious) imaginary girlfriend, whose presence real or imagined made zero difference to the plot. Then the ambiguous ending - the film was already lacking in depth so the idea that what I had seen might have been imagined just makes it seem even less worthwhile.Finally the acting was in my opinion just okay. We expect the joker to have idiosyncrasies and we saw that with Phoenix's portrayal but I did not see the transition or subtlety I'd hoped for. The empathy or sympathy desired by the director for the joker was not through the acting but rather through events we know to feel sad for others about. Frankly the Lego Batman movie did a better job of exploring the motivation of the joker character and creating some ambiguity of feeling."
tt0120815,"This is truly the best war movie i've ever seen!!! Eerytime I watch it I cannot stop crying, I get goosebumps only by thinking of it; what makes it so special is that ""Private Ryan"" seems to have learned the lesson: ""EARN THIS!"", it seems that he truly respected a dying man's wish. About the scenes in the movie, I played the computer game ""Medal of Honor - Allied Assault"" and I was surprised to see a lot of the movie scenes in the game (Normandy, Sniper city - Caparzo, The bridge) or vice versa. I don't have to tell you that MOHAA is my favorite Computer game ever. All the respect to the genius of Steven Spielberg (I mean it's like he was there)Bottom line: if you haven't seen it yet, YOUR GREAT LOSS"
tt0372784,"Whether you like this version of Batman or not ultimately depends on how faithful you are to the classics. I am a huge fan of Batman the Animated series created by Bruce Timm and Paul Dini, as well as Tim Burton's Gothic interpretations, not to mention the Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.Batman to me has always been a tale of how good people fall into sin and how everyone has a dark side. The star of the show isn't Batman himself, but the supporting cast of villains, each committing acts of crime out of revenge or redemption. All of them had a heart and were once human, now trapped in a shell of a monster. The profound thing about it all, was that Batman himself was just as insane as the people he brought in, only he believed he was fighting on the right side of the law. You get none that here. All villains commit random acts of terror, determined to destroy Gotham because they think its a cesspool.But I think the thing that bugged me the most was how they fundamentally changed Bruce Wayne's character in this movie. In the animated series, he is indeed portrayed as tortured soul but he also comes across as being a highly intelligent and sophisticated man. He was able to take down guys like Superman in Dark Night Returns, simply because he was able to outsmart him and was very resourceful. A key point that they missed in this movie was the inner struggle Bruce Wayne has to want to give it all up and settle down with someone he loves. One of my favorite moments for example, is in Mask of the Phantasam where Bruce Wayne is at his parents grave in a thunder storm, begging them to release him of his vow. He is in love with Andrea and wants to spend the rest of his life with her. He cries and begs for a sign, in which Andrea then shows up and two begin crying in each others arms. Bruce was actually happy. It wasn't until Andrea left him that he accepted his fate as Batman.This Batman has none of the human qualities from above. He can't laugh at himself and is full of pure anger and rage. He's almost like Spawn. In fact, the parallels are dead similar with him scaring the crap out of his villains before taking them down. Spawn of course is cooler given that he actually gives the bad guys what they deserve by decapitating them limb by limb.Okay, so let's not compare animation and comics, let's just focus on the film instead. Does it surpass in Tim Burton's movies? Hell no. Sure, Tim Burton didn't have all of the special effects technology that we have today but his twisted imagination allowed him to create a world that was totally Gothic and true to me. I liked the idea of smiling clowns blowing fire from their mouths and monkeys armed with machine guns. The Batman of the past was actually fun to watch as he'd stuff the fiery baton down the jesters throat and pick up two mimes and knock them out by bashing their heads together. It was always the cutest of things doing the evilest of deeds, like the marching penguins in Batman Returns.Burton was also faithful to the love interests of Bruce Wayne as well. It was always set up like a Greek tragedy with the love of his life being the villain he tried to stop. I also like the old Batman costume, the old batmobile and the old batwing. Michael Keaton also played a much better Batman than Christian Bale in that he always looked cool and in control. In this movie, Bale sounds like he has a frog stuck in his throat whenever he tries to speak and the mask he wears makes his head look a bit too big.But I think the crushing blow came at the end, when they tried to reintroduce the Joker. I loved Tim Burton's version because the Joker's whole purpose in that movie was to harass Batman, being that he killed his parents and was the one villain who could outsmart him. I hated how they changed that because Batman in reality is just as responsible for putting villains in his own life as they are for fueling his drive for vengeance.Overall, I have to say that this movie was bad. The fights scenes made no sense whatsoever and were put together by a bunch of stunt men, made up of 60 different takes. It totally blew up everything I came to love and respect about the dark knight and lacked the emotion and humanity of the original series. We didn't need another movie explaining his past, Mask of the Phantasam did a much better job with a lower budget too.I understand that they want to remake Batman for the new generation of fans but if this is the best they can do, then I'm hopping of this train right now. In the meantime, I'll just stick to the classics to remember Batman in his glory days."

tt0114369,An ordinary movie atracting viewers with great performances. For me the best moment was Joe DOE's philosophical comments about criminal law and justice while being seated at back of detectives at car.
tt0848228,"After all the hype, I was expecting an entertaining movie. To me, that means a plot and story line that I can feel a part of and be interested in what happens to the characters. I pretty much became bored due to feeling no connection with the characters and nothing unexpected happening...sure there are special effects and a bunch of stuff thrown in just to see if it would stick to the wall, but none of it engaging. Then there were characters that were so shallow that I felt no interest in who they were or what part they played...did Gwineth Paltrow actually get paid for whatever it is she was doing? The Hulk seemed to be more of an after thought in this story as there was no consistency in his role. In the Hulk's first scene he's an uncontrollable force that destroys anything regardless of whether it involved resources that belonged to good or evil. The climax of the movie which involves an alien invasion, was far from exciting due to minimal effort being made to compel the viewer into wondering ""Oh my, whats going to happen now"". Instead, the feeling evoked was ""gee, that was an OK special effect""."
tt0102926,"Silence of the Lambs is one of those films in which a very formidable performance(s) overshadow the flaws and weaknesses in that film. No one questions or doubts the performance by lead actress Jodie Foster or more specifically the outworldly turn by Sir Anthony Hopkins whose Hannibal Lecter is a regular figure in pop culture. First time watching, I was so engrossed by these performances that I couldn't pay much attention to anything else, but after a rewatch, I have some troubles with this film.To start, I'd like to mention that this film has not aged very well. The truth is in nowadays woke Hollywood such a film would never be greenlighted. Considering that this film was made in 1991, I just can't shake the mipression that this film was regressive. Besides that notion, I also didn't particularly like the music utilized in here, I think this film was one of the last thrillers that used a classic orchestral score before moving forward to a more synth/techno based sound that suits much much better for such a film.I also despise the absurd fetishism with pop psychology this film represents. In reality, psycholists don't tend to eat human livers and are not spoiled narcissistics. Psychology is a term we often associate with trying to heal depression, anxiety and personality disorders, not so much about cannibalism and manslaughter.Overall, had not been for the excellence Anthony Hopkins exudes, Silience of the Lambs were already all but forgotten."
tt1375666,"There is no doubt that Nolan is a very talented director, and I like a lot of his films, but sadly I think like a number of other hugely successful directors before him (Peter Jackson springs to mind) his success has led to a detrimental degree of freedom for him to churn out his own poorly-written scripts unchecked, and make films that are about an hour longer than they need to be.I know I'm swimming against the tide of public opinion here, but while I was hugely excited about seeing Inception back when it came out, I was absolutely crushed on first viewing. I found it terribly written (the film begins with enough exposition scenes to fill a normal film's running time!), incomprehensible (editing was all over the place, action dull and repetitive), visually disappointing (all the best bits were revealed in the trailer and were all contained in the exposition scenes rather than having anything to do with the story) and with a concept that just didn't hold water (the dream sequences seemed to always resemble Matrix out-takes and were held together by a logic that just wasn't very dream-like)!Perhaps if Nolan had a studio breathing down his neck and someone to revise his shaky script this could have turned out well, but after the success of TDK he can effectively write his own ticket and is (sadly) free to churn out this kind of lazy and self-indulgent snooze-fest. The same thing happened with Peter Jackson after LOTR with King Kong (an hour too long, too much freedom etc.)Hans Zimmer's incredible score was about the only positive I took out of Inception (Zimmer's brilliant scores are increasingly the glue that holds Nolan's films together and makes them seem better than they are). Despite his obvious talents and love of film (I love him for shooting Batman stuff in IMAX 70mm!) Nolan has some very bad habits (mainly relying on his and his brother's writing) which I think really hamper his films these days. I loved TDK, but it frustrates me in almost equal measure, and though I haven't seen The Dark Knight Rises yet, I will go in with very low expectations based on his apparently dwindling form."
tt0167261,"Yes, it's true. Return of the King may have won more of the Oscars as the culmination of Peter Jackson's magnificent cinematic achievement, but history will in fact adjudge ""The Two Towers"" as the greatest of the three Rings. If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film, then Two Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter Jackson said he based it on ""Zulu""- and we can see why. It has a dramatic intensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them. TTT also has the best score Howard Shore has produced. And it has the best dialogue.The screenplay explains (with barely disguised contemporary resonance) what we are protecting in Western civilisation when we defend ourselves against those who would wish to destroy it. When Sam tells Frodo that there are ""some things worth fighting for"", when Merry tells Pippin that there ""won't be a Shire"" unless they do something about it, when King Theoden laments that ""the sun has gone down in the West"" this film could be entitled not the ""Two Towers"" but ""the Twin Towers"". It is Miltonic in its scope. It is cinema as art.Yes, one may quibble about certain Entish details, and I know that the Elves weren't supposed to be at Helm's Deem, and that Faramir is a little undeveloped, but does this matter? Not at all. The Extended version is better than the original, but does not need to make such a quantum leap as Fellowship managed with its EE. However it will be a film that is seen as a landmark in cinema. A trilogy which may never be bettered. And a reminder of what we are all here for"

tt0468569,"Normally I would give this a 7.5 out of 10 but since I cant' I'll give it a seven. How anyone could rate this title that high on IMDb.com is amazing to me. It's mostly fanboys that believe this is the best movie ever and the best thing since sliced bread but what most fanboys fail to notice because they lack objectivity is that while the movie is a good one, it is quite flawed and nowhere near as perfect as many of the fanboys have rated.A couple things I noticed when I watch this movie, the movie goes on way too long. Even my friends agreed and they are huge Batman fans. There are about 3 or 4 points in the movie where it seems like it will end but goes on for another 30 minutes. And while Heath Ledger's performance is top notch and Bale as Bruce Wayne is pulled of quite flawlessly, his Batman persona is a bit weak. The voice is annoying, and many times throughout the movie, he seemingly plays second fiddle.I can't know Eckhart's casting as Two Face but Maggie Gyllenhall just doesn't seem to fit and just seems to be a standalone piece of eye candy.There are many things I can harp about but I'm not here to knock the movie. There are good points, cinematography great, Joker and Two Face played excellently by their counterparts, mood was effective and story flowed quite well albeit a bit too long.BUT this movie doesn't even belong in mention to some of the greats and shame on many movie fans that had this movie rated higher than such classics as The Godfather. Obviously the fanboys bought way too much into the hype."
tt0167260,"and poor characterization.As a technical achievement it's a masterpiece.  As a work of drama, it's mediocre to lame.The dialogue scenes were overwrought with drama, much like a soap opera, although instead of sappy Hammond organ music, we had the sappy orchestral score, rising and falling on practically every syllable.Jackson deserves a lot of points for his technical skills but none for his artistry."
tt0120737,"...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've read ""The Lord of the Rings"" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Silmarillion"" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in ""The Hobbit"" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron.Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of 'Fellowship of the Ring' lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? I've read a reviewer saying he'd make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with 'Alvin and the Chimpmunks' kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least.Ok, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jackson's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson's, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; that's the thing with books: each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried ""ranger"". Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, he's willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the 'best friend' everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can't wait for his return.Quite frankly, I can't wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, I'll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25¬¢ novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure."
tt0993846,"Two and a half hours into the film and I was non the wiser on where I was being taken. Character and storyline development was sidestepped for a vulgar expression of the American psyche - overt sexuality, the glorification of the abuser with no reference at all to the abused, excess without meaning.Many seem to believe that this is the crowning achievement of both Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese. DiCaprio clearly lacks the depth of character that he has shown in many of his previous movies. He seems to have taken a step backwards, yelling, screaming and over-acting at every instance. As for Scorsese, more and more over time I am missing the point of his movies. They are - dull and lack the intelligent treatment of characters that he had in his early films.There are times when you seriously question why directors going off on major tangents in their careers, and why some wonderful actors continue to follow those directors. It is certainly time for DiCaprio to get out from under the shadow of Scorsese who seems to be slowly losing the plot.I did not enjoy the film in the slightest."
tt0468569,"Batman. Pause and think about that character for a minute.
""The Batman"" is a guy in a spandex bat suit going around fighting crime, a superhero character from a comic book from the 1940's for young children looking for a bit of fun and a place for their juvenile imaginations to run free. His sworn enemy is ""the Joker"", a clown with clown tricks up his sleeve who's a villain.Where the earlier Tim Burton adaptations were fun and tongue in cheek, this here takes the Batman, the guy running around in spandex in a bat suit fighting off the bad guys... and makes an attempt at a disconcertingly, utterly serious film noir with an atmosphere about as dense as a horror movie, exceeding the 2hr30 mark. It's... like a joke, it's something akin to the concept for a comedy sketch one would have. To take something a bit ridiculous and light, and reverse its momentum in making it into this piece that takes itself completely, utterly seriously. It's a very common premise for many comedy sketches or concepts.The fact it was received so absurdly well by the greater public is, sadly, testament to how empty and strayed our current times are, that the common individual looks for a hero and ideals of greatness, epic drama, and meaning, in something like a 3 hour long horror movie/thriller version of Batman directed by Christopher Nolan. And this review doesn't even take into account the film from a technical perspective: too many characters, cringy silly scenes, way too long... etc"
tt0361748,"First important thing to say is that I am a massive Tarantino fan . He is my favorite director.In general , I liked this movie too. It had some amazing , unforgetable scenes that really grab you and keep you glued to the screen like you are sitting with actors.Acting is just superb , nothing less , nothing more. A definite standout was Christoph Waltz , his performance was very believable and well written just like every other Tarantino film.Since this is a Tarantino film , the bloody fights and gore are still present however there is just too many characters in this one and no one really gets enough time to shine especially Brad Pitt.Waltz steals every scene he is in but the plot just dragged for too long losing focus on characters.I was amazed by the bar scene and everything about it but for every good moment in this movie there is at least 3 boring conversations and scenarios that are just not interesting enough because the characters are not interesting enough for me to care.Reservoir Dogs was a much shorter film but did an incredible job with character , same goes to Pulp Fiction , same goes to Jackie Brown.I am not saying this movie needed more action. It just needed more focus. For me , it was a great movie overall , I would recommend it to anyone but it is just not rewatchable in my opinion.PlatinumanYT 7.5/10."
tt0167260,"Many critics cite the 1952 film ""The Greatest Show of Earth"" as the poorest Best Picture selection in Academy history.   That dubious distinction should now go to ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,"" which makes DeMille's circus epic seem like the greatest show on earth in comparison.   It was not only the Academy, but also the once-relevant New York Film Critics Circle that chose this film as the year's best.  It's a wonder that the ghost of Pauline Kael didn't use her after-life influence with the All Mighty to strike the entire group dead.This video game-like film goes from one chase scene to the next with little in the way of plot development.  I've seen all three films and don't have a clue what the fellowship of the ring is, or the significance of the two towers, nor where the king was returning from.  Director Jackson failed to include much in the way of plot exposition in nine plus hours of film!The computer-generated Gollum was the most interesting character in the film; at least he wanted to kill off those annoying hobbits.  Ian McKellen is distinguished in his knightly role and added a touch of class to the otherwise endless stream of special effects. The female stars of the film, Tyler and Blanchett, have so little screen time that it doesn't make sense to even have them in the film.  Apparently Tyler's character is present merely to suggest that Mortensen's character is heterosexual.  Why Blanchett has such an annoying smile on her face each fifteen seconds she is on screen is a mystery to me."
tt0120815,"The movie had incredible special effects and entertaining scenes, however the movie is full of half-truths, lies and propaganda.Truths: There was a US, British and Canadian led invasion of Normandy France in June, 1944.Lies: There was no Private called Ryan who lost his two brothers, however there was a Airbourne soldier lost for 18 days behind German lines, however he rescued himself after walking into US lines, no one set out to rescue him and there was no giant battle in the fictional town of Ramelle.Propaganda: In this movie (besides the opening scene in which hundreds of US soldiers were slaughtered on Omaha Beach) the average US soldiers kills 50 German soldiers, gets shot (falls over dramatically in slow motion with stupid opera music playing), then pulls out his pistol and kills another 50 Germans and then dies dramatically saying something stupid like ""Tell my wife I love her"". In this movie a platoon of 20 US soldiers, takes out 100 German soldiers, 2 Marder IIIs and 2 Tiger tanks with improvised weapons like wet-sock bombs and Molotov cocktails.

tt0167260,"What won't be said about this over-exposed and somewhat over-glorified movie by now?It's fantastic that Jackson completed the series in tact, with great continuity, in an engaging fantasy -- staying true to much beloved books.[***SPOILERS AHEAD***]That said, Jackson arguably missed an opportunity to develop a movie that improved upon the flaws in the source books. The much-publicized never-ending story ending is just one. Making 45 minutes out of an appendix was more than a bit of a waste. And 45 minutes of crying, hugging hobbits tested my patience far too long.At the same time, I couldn't help but feel that these characters -- who had time to develop in the movie as little more than monster-bait -- made no emotional connection to me over the past 3 movies. And yet I felt wholly manipulated by 45 minutes of tears and hugging as if Jackson was trying to get an emotional response out of me that was never there to begin with. But at least it wasn't as horrid as the Star Wars Ewok conclusion...And then there's Lord Denethor -- written into the books, but a character whose self-immolation death wish for himself and his remaining son added absolutely zilch to the story and movie. But Jackson, staying true to the books, left in what was useless storyline fodder -- fodder that should have otherwise staved off my early rush to the bathroom by being left on the cutting room floor. My kingdom for an editor...That said, what's good definitely outweighs the flaws. A very good, albeit not great, movie."
tt0108052,"Schindler's list is not a bad film per se - Liam Neeson is very good as Schindler and if you edit out some of the more overblown scenes - the story is still riveting. Yet it could have been so much more if the story just told simply and if the central theme were fully understood and developed.Before the war Schindler and his friend, Goeth were boozy, flirtatious German businessmen. Both would have likely been uninspired failures had there been no war. In a kinder world, Goeth's and Schindler's moral differences might have manifested themselves in the size of the tip that they would leave the barmaid. In war, the consequences of moral choices are greatly magnified, resulting in Schindler becoming a most unlikely heroic figure, and Goeth becoming a loathed prison commandant. In the film, Spielberg elevates Schindler to sainthood status and portrays Goeth as a sadistic psychopath. By sanitizing Schindler's many faults (boozing, gambling, womanizing...) and by demonizing Goeth, Spielberg severs our connection with them and, ironically, blunts the conflict between them. Adolf Eichmann was far more chilling than Charles Manson. Unlike Manson, whom we could dismiss as psychotic, Eichmann was the faceless functionary that we have all experienced, whose defense of ""following orders"" is one that we have all heard, a defense that was used by many during the war, and one that we might see ourselves using under similar circumstances had we not Schindler's courage. By making Schindler a saint, Spielberg diminishes both his accomplishment and his inspiration to us - saints have no problems making the right decision - the rest of us do. Rather than a gaping chasm, there is but a fine moral line between Schindler and Goeth - one that we tread every day, which fortunately for us, rarely does more than determines a barmaid's salary.Spielberg does not develop this simple theme, preferring to impress us with a grandiose view of a great moral tale. Instead, he comes off as the underskilled sous-chef drowning a wonderful filet mignon in an overly rich sauce. The quality of the ingredients still shine through despite the clumsy handling but does not approach its great potential. In the end, the best thing about the film is that it reminds Americans of a monstrous event in history. It is unfortunate that this reminder is necessary and that it reduces such a timeless parable to a useful public service announcement."
tt0120737,"It took me a while to watch this film (2020), but it was the best I've ever seen, it is just fantastic, it needs no praise, I dare say that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best cinematographic work ever produced by mankind. Perfect.Film seen on August 8, 2020."
tt1130884,"Unlike many of the other reviewers, I actually thought this movie wasn't scary at all. Rats, people with scars, Nazis - this is all being used BETTER before. The movie as a horror fails. The movie as a mystery fails completely. I don't think someone will buy this story since Memento said it all.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!Please know, that I reveal the full story - incl. the ending.The story is about a guy, who was a US Marshall- married, with 3 children. He didn't pay enough attention to his wife and drank too much. His wife was unhappy and had mental problems. One day she got completely insane and murdered their 3 children. When our main character, the US Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) gets home, he found his wife completely crazy, his children murdered. So he can't take this - he shoots her, so that she doesn't have to be put away. But this whole guilt destroys him slowly. He also gets insane, paranoid and have to be put away. His guilt kills him slowly from the inside, and so he creates this imaginary world - where he is still a Marshall and he investigates a disappearance of a patient from the mental hospital. The doctors in the hospital try through the whole movie to help him, to make him face the truth. And in the end he does. But what can you do when you can't take the truth, when it is too much to bare? How can you live with all this guilt? Isn't it better to be insane and not face the reality?The movie is following the book very strictly, except the ending. THE ENDING isn't shocking, or scary. It is purely dramatic and rises moral questions.I think this movie fails completely to be scary movie, thriller or whatever Dicaprio and Scorcese intended. But I think accidentally they found something deeper, something really dramatic and interesting.The big problem is, they didn't go further with that, but basically count on cheap tricks to scary the audience, instead of make her think."
tt0120737,"This story was told very well. I felt like the narration in the beginning of the film was overdone a bit, but when the dialogue finally began, it was amazing. The characters are very original, though I would've liked to see more character development from some of the characters, there is no denying how well the actors know their characters. Elijah Wood was an excellent choice for Frodo Boggins. The world created through this film is amazing.Overall, 8/10."
tt0111161,"I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time.Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame.But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title."
tt0120815,"Saving Private Ryan is, without a doubt, the best war movie ever made and one of the best movies of all time. I wasn't sure what I would think of this movie before I saw it. I heard the gore and carnage was too much, and I heard the story and action was great.When I finally did see it, I loved it. The gore wasn't as bad, in my opinion, as everyone said it was. I thought the battles scenes were fantastically done. They were entertaining to watch, but with a certain sadness to it. I also think the moments of reflection among the soldiers was very good too. You got to hear their thoughts about the enemy, the soldiers and the war itself.The acting was great, especially by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks certainly deserved the Academy Award for best actor, even though he did not get it. Matt Damon also did a great job as Private Ryan. Watch for a great cameo-like performance by Ted Danson.The storyline was interesting. Most of all, it showed what the war was like and how horrible it was. Some of the American soldiers were killed before they even entered the battlefield, some before they could even fire back, and some went down in a blaze of glory. Either way, you felt pity for the Americans and hatred for the Nazis.The mission the soldiers were on was to find a single man, Private Ryan, and bring him home, because all of his brothers were killed and he was the last male survivor of the family. You, along with the soldiers in the movie, will always be thinking about whether it is worth it to risk eight lives to save one man. Many things happen through the film that will keep changing your mind about it.If blood, guts and gore bothers you, you really should not watch Saving Private Ryan. Otherwise, I recommend going out and buying it right away. You will not be disappointed."
tt0167260,"Ok just to clear something up. Despite the amazing amount of hype and numerous people saying these film were the best ever, I tried when I watched this and 1st film to watch them with an open mind neither being swayed to thinking there great because everyone else said this or the opposite. But come on, people. I have to say they appear just whizzy special effects lead extreme good versus dark (as in surroundings) ugly evil people (basically Star Wars). The storyline is tame and straighforward and the characters uninteresting. Star Wars is better and there massively overrated as well (if they removed those annoying 2 robots all together). Its basically a good film for kids with all this simplicity and straight good v evil, and I fail to see why so many adults like it so much. None of the three films deserve to be in the top100 if your like and competition of thoughtful, intelligent, well acted, important, sharply written films there. Maybe everyone just likes a straight forward situation of immense good vs terrible evil, so they know who there supporting, rather than the immensely complicated debatable thought provoking events of real life.I guess thats why the genre is called fantasy."
tt0993846,"Wolf is a waste unless you are a 19-year-old boy who thinks Napoleon Dynamite was funny. Sex without passion. Drugs without end. Scenes without points. Acting without entertainment. But let's go to the board.1. Sex.....tons of it. This film is pretty well soft porn. But it is also about as sexually exciting as watching a Zamboni polish an ice rink....and about as cold. 2. Drugs.....tons of it. Think of Scarface levels. Hey, drunks are funny, right? Think Cheech and Chong without the laughs. 3. Vulgarity.....worse than Bridesmaids and much less humorous.During WWII, the US 8th Air Force delivered nearly 700 thousand tons of explosives. If each one of them had had the f-word painted on them, it still would fall short of the f-bombing in this movie.But even if the pretty naked girls had been arousing, the drug quantities smaller, and the vulgarity lighter, it still would be a tremendously boring film.I am sure it will be touted as a great movie....a modern Gatsby tale. I am sure there will be rewards. I am sure Tarrentino will rip it off and be declared a genius.But none of that will change the fact that Wolf of Wall Street is a dog on the screen."
tt0120815,"the 3 points i gave this movie are all for the landing at the beach. the movie itself was just the usual Hollywood nonsense that thanks to big names (like Spielberg, Hanks and Damon) and big advertisement was successful. i admit the acting was good, but it still doesn't give this movie any importance."
tt0372784,"This has to be one of the more disappointing movies I've seen in a while. With such a top-notch cast of talent with names such as Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, and especially Gary Oldman, one could be expecting to see a high-quality piece of cinematic entertainment.Unfortunately, this was far from the case.I used to be an avid comic book collector in my youth, and while Batman was never one of my favorites, I looked past that and put that past to keep an open mind and let the movie speak for itself. It really was not well-spoken.The plot, while unlikely, is totally non-cohesive and one finds themselves constantly laughing throughout and the nonsense they are watching. The characters are weakly written (especially Gary Oldman's pathetically boring 'Good-guy' cop) and the screenplay could have been conceived of by a 12 year-old C grade student. I only watched this because it was on sale after Thanksgiving for $4.88 on DVD and I can honestly say it wasn't even worth that.If you are really in the mood for a good comic book movie, watch the first X-Men movie. You will be far less disappointed."
tt0468569,"To be honest this movie has the same plot-line played over and over again until its done till death, i liked the first new batman film more, although many people liked the pace, i thought it was actually very slow. Heath Ledger plays the Joker OK, but nothing special although the joker clips were a lot more interesting than the batman parts. I think this would have been a great movie if they had shortened it and stopped overusing that climatic building sound over and over again. I feel that the next batman movie will not be so great, and why is everyone making movies about superheros's ------------------------------------- ------------------------------------"
tt0102926,"I saw Lambs during its original release and thought it was pretty good. Having seen it again recently I did still enjoyed it but not quite to the extent I did originally. One thing that didn't hold up was Foster's performance. She still does fine but it did feel a bit forced at times. Her concerns regarding her background and the flashbacks seemed slight this time around. The wrap up regarding Buffalo Bill character seemed a little convenient here. As for the dialogue it still mostly worked but some of it did come off as trite and while not exactly dated, just ordinary. Despite some shortcomings The Silence of the Lambs is still a solid thriller worth checking out."
tt7286456,"This movie is probably about a 7.2. It is pretty enjoyable. It isn't as good as the people who are paid to post fake reviews here claim but those people are easily discovered by the fact that they rate every move 10/10.It is worse than the Dark Knight and I didn't find the Joker better than Heath's or Jack Nicholson's
This isn't an action movie so people going into it expecting that won't get it but it is a good character study which unfortunately may be boring to many people. Reminded me of There Will be Blood than Batman"
tt0468569,"Spectacular and entertaining but no more than that.Batman Begins is way better. This movie has nothing to add that movie and/or original story.Be honest! What do you remember about this movie, a week after seeing it? Just the Joker walking out the exploding hospital I guess.Nicely done but not ""Nolan proof"". Please don't make a third one Christopher (you're still one of my favorite directors).Summary: go see it for it's spectacular actions and... that's it.Nothing more! (sorry)This is the required 10th line"
tt0114369,"This is a top 250 movie?!?  Brad Pitt's acting is shallow, stereotypical, and not nuanced.  He does the California surfer-dude routine throughout the entire movie as though some uneducated simpleton dolt could wind up with his job...sorry, but I don't think so.  The plot line relies on a connect...the...dots methodology -- contrived, and largely predictable with action interspersed with banal social dialogue.  I gave this 4/10 mostly for the fine acting of Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman.  Very silly -- Brad Pitt's acting had me laughing...and not in a good way.   In defense of Mr. Pitt, I think he was badly miscast since I've seen other movies in which he does at least a respectable job."
tt0137523,"i first watched this film a week ago, and since then bought it and made my girlfriend watch it with me. the opening sequence as the camera travels thru a human body while zooming out is breathtaking. it sets the motif of the film which is looking inside of oneself. the settings really lend themselves to Jack's life and the twisted philosophy that man can only achieve happiness thru self destruction is almost believable. the film has great performances from Norton, Pitt, Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf's tits, and reaches a shocking conclusion (which is why it needs a second watching). my girlfriend didn't really like it, complaining it had no real plot (which it doesn't especially) and the only good thing is the ending. i feel this is wrong, but the ending is what we end up judging all films by, ultimately."
tt0361748,"Did the film industry ball wash this movie because of the Jewish aspect or the theater as part of the plot?????? I appreciate good movies but......a ridiculous plot with decent acting holding together what is really just another Tarantino bathroom break plot. I'm serious. I could make up a better story. It's just ridiculous. The acting job by Christopher Waltz was good. Other than that, this is the most overrated movie of all time. The movie industry enjoys giving awards to itself but they reached on this one. Tarantino has the movie industry right where he wants them. Usually the plots and acting in his films are both ridiculous and awful. I must say that at least there was a bit of good acting in this one barely giving it a 6."
tt0137523,"I'm not much into graphic violence. This film transcends that. It has wonderful direction, and, even though it is brutal, it takes things to another ledge. Edward Norton is really controlled as he realizes his power. It's too easy to throw in spoilers so I will leave things to the viewer. The search for self and the growing cult around Fight Club made me suspicious. Still, to watch what happens to the two men at the center and what they are without Fight Club is the core. One of the neat things about this film is seeing it a second town makes it even better. The mental byplay between Pitt and Norton increases tension to explosiveness. If you want to see what can happen to a story when put in masterful hands, read the book (which is outstanding), and see the movie. They show that art forms can treat the same material, each in their own ways."
tt0422272,"At last! A very good horror/thriller movie that isn't Asian. Most recent titles in Europe and USA have been quite disappointing. People get tired of failed remakes (The grudge & The ring series). The originals are the real deal. But with Fragile it's different.The movie has a very nice mood, which is a result of various factors merged perfectly to create the right ambiance. The building itself, old and making all sorts of weird noises, the music, scary enough, the dark sceneries, the vast emptiness, the solitude. Also the movie isn't the typical ""spooky"" genre... constantly trying to scare you enough so that you'll jump off your chair and scream like a girl... resulting in predictable moments. This one sets you in the right mood and gives you that strange feeling ""i don't wanna look into the dark"" afraid of what may be coming out of there. The plot itself isn't very complex and nothing new to the sort, but it is well put together so you won't be disappointed with it.Very soft, yet gripping, and very atmospheric, which is in fact it's major strength, Fragile is one I really recommend. Specially to watch during the night.8/10"
tt0167260,"This morning I was sitting in Japanese literature class, while Murakami's Novel ""A Wild Sheep Chase"" was being discussed, and a student so boldly suggested a number of parallels between it and ""The Lord of The Rings."" To my dismay a majority of the students in the class started to giggle, thinking this comment was almost a joke. What's sad about it, is that his points were valid and made perfect sense. He was comparing the Murakami novel's narrative, characters, and moral messages to LOR, and it was a most convincing comparison. Literally everything from how the characters are similar to how the plot concludes is very similar.Based on the class reaction, I have to ask, when did Lord of the Rings cease to be literature and become another Hollywood movie? 15 years ago, if the same comparison were made, people would value it and even consider it. Before LOR became a movie it was one of the most read books in the 20th century and its readership and importance in a country like Japan was present. So why couldn't this parallel exist? After all Murakami was and is heavily influenced by Western literature.Before this class, I only criticized LOR as a film in itself, and gave it credit for exposing people to a classic story. In fact, I'm pretty sure these movies will introduce millions more to the books. But now I feel differently. The lack of integrity these movies possess will pollute the books and therefore reduce their real cultural importance. When I watch these movies, I see Hollywood on a grand scale. I see little of what is in the novels and instead see an inverse effect from what I expected. Now when I consider the novel I can only picture the dumb-wit characters, so shallow and bland following the plot line like a trail of breadcrumbs. If I could go back and reverse the money and time I wasted watching these films I would. In fact, I wouldn't suggest them to anyone, because they in no way enhance the original work. I'm not critical of film adaptations of novels in many cases. Don't get me wrong. A great filmmaker can take a great novel and show you things about it that you could have never thought of yourself. He or she can interpret a work of literature as the original author originally interpreted reality itself. Italian and Japanese cinema seem to have a good track record of adaptations, but American cinema¬Ö Its %@#$! Please don't butcher anymore great works.Please.... Leave something for those who actually care about art."
tt0480025,"The serious actor loves to play the racist skinhead. It is the male equivalent of a lesbian role, as it shows their diversity. See Tim Roth stride down the corridor with a swastika tattooed on his forehead in Made in Brittan. See Russell Crowe bulk up to play a similar goon in Romper Stomper. And (to a lesser extent) see Edward Norton try and add some pathos to a fellow with ugly tattoos in American History X. This Is England is unique, in that it offers a factual origin of skinhead culture, and distinguishes between the good (nonracist, offshoot of punks and Rastas in the early '80s) and the bad (racist, National Socialist) skinheads.Shaun is a 12-year-old whom life continually shits upon. Recently having lost his father in the Falklands War, he and his mother have slipped below the poverty line. He receives grief at school for wearing flares, and is shown little sympathy from a Pakistani corner shop owner. After a particularly rough day at school, he bumps in to a group of quite affable 'good' skinheads, who take pity and include him in their activities. Once Shaun is fully inaugurated into their clique, a 'bad' skinhead enters the fray. Combo (someone who seems far too old to be hanging out with teenagers) has just been released from prison, and is seething with bitterness and hatred. He convinces Shaun and half of his 'good' skinhead pals to join the dark side. Shaun, bitter himself at what little life has left him with, takes the National Front role with great gusto. Exacting revenge on the Pakistani clerk whom gave him an earful in act one, and generally enjoying the power trip of pushing around minorities. He also finds a kind of father figure in Combo. And when Combo's bitterness gets the better of him, he loses faith, and as the back of the DVD case attests, learns that ""hate will get you nowhere"". Collective sigh, now on with the faults...From the opening montage of all that is '80s (Atari, Margaret Thatcher) there are far too many gauche attempts to make this a period piece, instead of crafting an unspoken zeitgeist. They might as well have called it ""This is The '80s"", as all the anti-Thatcher graffiti doesn't give the viewer the benefit of the doubt. Made in Brittan had the good fortune to be timely, This is England is all hazy memories.Then there are the mixed messages. Woody, the 'good' skinhead whom first includes Shaun, is genuinely likable, and has an amazing screen presence. He endears himself to Shaun, and to the audience, when he defuses Shaun's mother while she's on an angry tirade. However, when the baton is passed from Woody to Combo, the film shifts from working class empowerment, to bitter and depressing. Woody drops out of the frame completely. And when he is making excuses to leave a party once Combo arrives, I too was with the antagonists in pleading for him to stay. ""No don't leave! This movie will be depressing without you!"". It makes it difficult to fathom that Shaun would prefer the company of Combo to that of Woody, once Woody has been established as such a nice guy. It adds an ugly ""but"" to the text. ""Be proud of who you are, but not too proud"", ""go with the flow, but not if it goes in this direction"". It's too muddled and not concise enough.Shaun also romances a dimwitted girl, nicknamed Smells, who is 4 years older than him, but looks like she's a good 10 years his senior. I know this film is autobiographical, but the coupling of a little boy and a ""well versed"" teenage girl just doesn't look right. There are a few other nameless characters whom seem either far too old, or too young for the context. You would believe it in real life, but strangely, not in a movie.The ending is a spectacular misfire. A film which has traded on gritty realism throughout, suddenly tries its hand at art house symbolism in the final ten minutes. It's attempt to choke you up fails miserably through bad choice of song, and TV movie closeup. From the second act on, it is far too depressing, not warm melancholic, cold depressing. Yes, it portrays the resentment of those who had the misfortune to come of age under Thatcher, but its purpose it far from clear. It captures many moments of the lower middle, to working class lifestyle perfectly. Particularly the shoe shopping scene, which everyone who grew up without family money can relate to. And how a child can gravitate to odd social groups though simple lack of opportunity. It is the lack of concise point which hinders this film from becoming a classic. Maybe we should all stop looking for some moral high ground in skinhead films. Unfortunately for This is England, they went for atonement. A conceit to post-American sensibilities, tacked on to very British experience. Which still leaves the ambiguous Made in Brittan the best of the genre."
tt0108052,"a tremendous achievement. heartwrenching and powerful beyond words. acting is first rate. Spieldberg's best. whoever dislikes this masterpiece is either dead or knows nothing about what an amazing motion picture is all about. if you are not moved to tears watching this ""film of the '90's"", then rush out and get a heart transplant!"
tt0114369,"I don't understand why people think this is a good movie.  The plot is predictable yet not really believable, the hero is unlikeable and the villain, who is supposed to be the movie's moral foundation (go figure *that* one), ultimately pulls the rug out from underneath the movie at the end.The scene where Brad Pitt allows the killer to escape was irritatingly hard to believe.  And what was the Gynneth Paltrow character's (not to mention her unborn child) sin?  The killer was careful to choose people who (at least in his mind) deserved to die yet at the crucial climax he completely broke with his pattern in a most incredible way.And where does a ""moral"" serial killer come from?  Seems like an oxymoron, but of course in the end we see that he's not moral after all.  Still, the whole concept rings hollow and leaves one wondering what the point of the movie was anyway?  It seems like it was just a story created to give the film makers a chance to show grisly murder scenes one after another in an attempt to shock us.If you want to see a much better movie along these lines (and much more disturbing because it's believable), watch ""Henry, the Portrait of a Serial Killer.""  And be sure to give it a higher vote than this turkey."

tt0111161,"The Shawshank Redemption is an exciting and very emotional excursion. It is the best ""jail"" movie ever made, for sure. There's suspense, surprises, and more, but it's true greatness is in it's show of the human spirit triumphing over impossible odds.

You could rewrite the episode of having the Doctor and his companions meet Dorian without changing any plot turns . Like DOCTOR WHO this episode borrows from the literary world and the name of Dorian gives a very strong clue where the episode is heading and if the Gestalt creature looks familiar that's because it appeared in the 1972 DOCTOR WHO story as one of title characters in The Sea DevilsGuest actor Geoffry Burridge as Dorian gives a slightly bizarre performance that mixes benign charm and understated menace until the episode climax where his manic laughing is on the same level as a pantomime dame .

tt1375666,"I'm afraid I'm a bit confused. I saw ""Inception"" last night. I had high expectations based on miles of positive ink from reviewers and professional critics, all tripping over themselves to bestow demigod status upon Christopher Nolan. These expectations were dashed to bits within the first thirty minutes of the film, and turned to a kind of dread as I realized what folks these days will accept as ""depth"" in their entertainment. I wish I'd never seen those gushing reviews, I would've enjoyed the film much more.Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Christopher Nolan's Batman reboots ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight."" For my money, those were without a doubt the second and third most effective superhero movies to date (sorry, Raimi wins.) The man certainly knows how to keep a story moving along, and he knows how to film action. In the case of The Dark Knight, Heath Ledger provided an emotional lynchpin non-pareil in his Joker portrait, and Nolan milked it for all it was worth. There was real pathos and genuine mortal horror built into the foundation of the film's impressive structure. Also, the fact that it was based on a comic book lowered the bar and allowed the audience to suspend just enough disbelief to allow most of the dorky plot elements to slip through and do their work.Now let's discuss obvious comparisons to an earlier effort in this vein‚Äîthat is, an action movie dolled up to the nines as philosophical treatise. I'll admit that I was never a fan of The Matrix. I thought it was asinine in conception and brutish in execution, even as I admired some of the visual effects and spectacular stunt work. Comparing The Matrix's ridiculous endless ""stream-of-consciousness"" gibberish about free will with, say, Roy Batty's laconic final soliloquy in Blade Runner, is like comparing the Twilight series' moronic teen romantic angst with David Foster Wallace. Unfortunately, Inception had precisely the same effect on me, which is to say very little.Here we find the great and terrible Nolan exploring the tired territory already plundered in countless films of yore, including Hitchcock's Spellbound and 1980's genre pics such as Brain Storm, The Dead Zone, and Dreamscape. The basic premise reads like a dime store sci-fi novel's back cover: ""In the future, we can enter into each other's dreams! Feel the magic of dreams, within dreams, within dreams! Experience the thrill and wonder of miraculous ""Dream Time¬ô."" Oh Boy!"" Within twenty minutes of the film's somewhat intriguing intro, I knew not only how it would end‚ÄîI also pretty much knew how we were getting there. Nolan plays primarily to the back row, and‚Äîno offense, America‚Äîbut we've been slightly dumbed down over the past few decades, and we're much easier as a whole to entertain than we used to be. Look back at a few films of the past with vast, labyrinthine plot structures like Hawk and Faulkner's ""The Big Sleep"", or practically anything by the Coen Brothers. What's defines their deep-impact gravitas, as opposed to the flat and diffuse emotional landscape of Inception? It's character development, pure and simple. In this case, Nolan didn't have a single character ‚Äîespecially the one played with typically earnest gusto by Leo Dicaprio‚Äîwith a plausibly human fatal flaw, foible, or reason for doing¬Ö uh, whatever it was he was doing. We're simply dropped into an alternate universe with rules seemingly invented to favor nerds of any stripe ‚Äîalmost impossibly similar to the one in The Matrix‚Äîand told to hold onto our hats, because here¬Ö we¬Ö go! Except we're not actually GOING anywhere, or at least not anywhere we haven't been a thousand times before.Sorry to rain on the parade of everyone that's ready to lionize C. Nolan as the great white hope of modern blockbuster cinema, but from my vantage, there is no there there. If you want a lesson in basic existential philosophy, take a class at your local community college. You'll get more out of it, and you can keep your textbook as a souvenir. If it's great car chases you're after, rent ""The French Connection,"" or ""Ronin."" In other words, keep your high-octane action movie out of my high-concept art film. These are two tastes that do not go great together. Meanwhile, if Inception somehow does ""become a religion"" in another five years, than I'm reconsidering my continued faith in Hollywood as some kind of egalitarian oracle, where the huddled masses can go to get their myths, and feel the true power of redemption. If this is the kind of movie that will be worshipped from now on, than the god of blockbuster cinema may truly be dead."
tt0816692,"Interstellar is a interesting film that questions the time in space in our reality a film that is straight up visually impressive The story is kind of odd but it's still worth in this type of film ever since I saw this movie I've been wondering what's up in space what type of life we can live on space and how is humans can evolve it the only thing that I did not really like was the main character being very one dimensional, but other than that this has a very good premise, and they will pay the movie that has a very good set up and pay off real well the performance was very very good and direction was... well it's Christopher Nolan 8.5/10."
tt0875595,"Have seen a number of great Turkish movies, Iklimler, Gegen die Wand, Mustang, and of course the magic Winter Sleep - but found this one to be the absolute nadir of cinematic skills from the region. The acting was ultra contrived, the dialogue was wooden, there was no continuity and scenes were inserted and then not concluded but just left hanging. For the best part of two hours my partner and I were left alternatively yawning and trying to figure out why a certain clip had been inserted without any reference to the main story line, which at best was weak to almost non-existent. I might watch another offering by Demirkubuz - but I'll give it ten minutes, and if he doesn't grab my attention by then, I'd rather quit."
tt0422272,"I like horror movies. ""Fragile"" is like nowadays ""japanese-horror"" movies,  but with a bit of European soul added.  Everything's set to get you some goosebumps. An old children's hospital  that is about to being closed, moody soundtrack, great set decorations  and props and makeup, and sound effects that make you jump out of your  skin sometimes. The movie hit a bullseye for me. Hospitals and  abandoned places scare the hell out of me so watching this movie was  like my worst nightmare came true.  It was definitively scarier than The Ring. If you get the creep from  hospitals, abandoned places and stuff like that, I do recommend this  movie."
tt1375666,"An incredibly unique film which deserves its plaudits purely for the intelligent world created. Whilst extremely complex, the 'science' allowing the story to unfold is explained for the most part, although I imagine everyone loses the plot on a first viewing at some point, for me I was okay until the very final Saito scene. It keeps you engaged throughout and I think (?) you're routing for the right people, although in reality the overarching reason to undergo the entire film is a little weak, possibly skimmed over, and purely a vehicle to discover the world of dreams.Visually it cannot be faulted, and the pairing with the music works excellently as well. You're constantly drawn into the film without it ever being something that will get your heart racing, more interesting than compelling. Having said that, it is really one of a kind, at least at this level, and so everyone should see Inception, if only to appreciate the depth Nolan went into."
tt0114369,"I know that many of you will probably want to strangle me for saying this, but I fell asleep during my first attempt at watching Se7en. I really tried to stay awake, but all attempts proved to be unsuccessful. I just couldn't stay interested. In order for a thriller to satisfy me, it has to have suspense and action. Se7en was lacking in both areas. I'll admit that the whole idea of incorporating the seven deadly sins into it was clever. However, the movie was not capable of holding my attention because it did not show any of the crimes as they were happening. When I watched the movie for the second time, I managed to stay awake. Once I got toward the end of the movie when ""John Doe"" was introduced, I finally understood what was so good about it. The end was definitely praiseworthy because it was the only intense part. I don't mean to bash the acting. Pitt, and Paltrow as well as the rest were superb actors. However, the overall storyline was insufficient."
tt7286456,"This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated."
tt1130884,"This review contains a spoiler.It's always great when people find a film they like and obviously some people really liked this film. For myself I lost interest in the first fifteen minutes and by the time I got to the end nothing could save it.While it's stylishly directed, it's unfortunately mostly style and little substance. The opening is great and for a few moments you think it's going to be a great movie, but quickly the story loses any forward momentum. The main character's hallucinations quickly overshadow any plot that was beginning to develop. The script sets up a false premise that really has nowhere to go. Indeed the script is telegraphing the end right from the start giving the bulk of the film a strangely aimless feel. I am amazed anyone could find it tense or refer to it as a horror film.A good psychological thriller needs to make you believe in it, but with the director undercutting the reality every step of the way I actually found many of the scenes laughable. Truth be told it seemed many of the actors were also struggling with the script and only clicked in at the end when there was a real story to be told.Unless you're a big Scorsese fan, save your money. My guess is this will be on television before you know it."
tt7286456,"The clueless scriptwriter, director and cast are oblivious to the concept of The Joker. Clowns are the slapstick, predictable fools who do stupid things to entertain small, childlike minds. This is a story that fits nowhere and merely provides two hours of tedious boredom.
The thin plot is uninteresting, the characters are dull and the entire thing could be played out, without losing a molecule of content, within fifteen minutes.
I was annoyed that it was this bad, given the enthusiastic reviews - but I can't say I was surprised. So much poor film-making gets a rave response that that the positive reviews simply mean lots of jaded or thhughtless people liked it. That's no indication of its quality, sadly.
Oh well, another two hours of watching mediocrity mixed with boredom just so that I can appreciate a good movie when one turns up."
tt0120815,"In ""Saving Private ryan"" the characters are so stereotyped(""the brave""; ""the cute"";""the rebel"";the timid"")that the critics and audience should be ashamed of.Why we should forgive the director's mistakes just because he is ""Steven Spielberg""?even some of the gruesome scenes of the film seem stolen from a real war documentary,SPR is a lot more inferior than the deep""The thin red line"" and to give every award of the planet to Spielberg is just ridiculous and childish,you just make him more spoiled and rich!."
tt0361748,"This movie was so bad that after years of using IMDb, I finally registered purely to write this comment.Crap doesn't begin to describe it.The most compelling evidence yet as to why Hollywood should be banned from making war movies.French and German are used as if trying to give some vague impression that Tarantino isn't completely full of ""unchecked ego"" - I would think that paying more attention to the plot and actual history would have been wise if I'd wanted to retain some semblance of accuracy - otherwise, sod it - why not have all characters speak English for the US audience (let's face it, no one else will be watching this)? A bit of escapism is all well and good, but this isn't even that, just purile nonsense. I'm not even that bothered by Hollywood's usual bending/rewriting/falsification of history for it's own ends - we all expect that - American hero, European baddies (at best numpties) - but this wasn't just unresearched childish adventure rubbish, but also cinematically juvenile - no subtlety, no nuance, just clumsy - like someone handed a 12 year old a camera and said, ""Make a film about WWII - let you imagination run wild"".What is cinema coming to when people rate this rubbish?"
tt0993846,"Save yourself and avoid this one! I give this a 2 only because some of the acting is good. Scorcese is going for something here, so it's not lazy filmmaking. But I feel like I got the message about 45 minutes into the movie and it didn't go anywhere from there. In all fairness, I missed the last 20-30 minutes because I just couldn't take it anymore. Some ruthless cutting of the screenplay would have helped some, but I don't know if there's much to salvage. The experience of seeing this was rather like having a really stressful day at work where nothing actually gets accomplished. A lot of the ladies are beautiful, but the sex is ugly - demeaning to both women and men. Oh, but I guess it's really about Wall Street. And the motivational speeches to the troops go on forever. I don't think there was a scene in this film that employed any economy of storytelling whatsoever. One critic (approvingly) described this as the last half hour of Goodfellas stretched out to three hours and that's pretty true. It reminded me a bit of the single-mindedness of Raging Bull, but was much harder to sit through. I think it's a bad sign when you start hoping that some of the characters will die of an overdose just so they'll shut up."
tt0120737,"This film is long.  It goes on and on and on, and just when you think it is finished, it goes on a bit more, and then, when it finally does finish, it just stops.  Rubbish.Lovely scenery, fight scenes quite good, and that's it.I have never fallen asleep at the cinema before but I did today and it was a blessed relief as, for me, the film was only six hours long as I was asleep for the middle two.Avoid this film.  At all costs.  Even more, avoid the kind of dullard lunatics who will say this was fantastic and you must read the books. Don't read the books - they are worse.Stay at home, rent a proper movie, watch it twice, make some tea, watch it again and you will still have used up less of your short life than by watching this terrible, terrible movie.God it was bad."
tt0381429,"A beautifully filmed story, the two film comparisons that come to mind are The Virgin Suicides and Morvern Callar. All of these films feature young girls, coping with circumstances that throw them into a spiral - an internal spiral - filmed with grace, attention to detail and a good ear for the soundtrack. There are difficult moments here, where I found myself saying 'Don't do it, don't do it', but she does because inexperience and lack of confidence make for poor choices. As soon as you can place yourself in her shoes, you will find this film moving, and very clearly (and poetically) observed. I recommend this film very highly, both for its clean and original voice - and very Australian voice - and the sympathy we feel for its very real lead characters."
tt1345836,"The Dark Knight Rises fails to capture the magic of its predecessors. While it was understandable to suspend disbelief for the Joker's antic because of his volatility, the same doesn't hold true for a cold and calculated Bane. This time the nihilistic philosophical lessons come off as pretentious and worn out. Even the repeated formula of action sequences pale in comparison to the first two films. What's left is a hastily done wrap-up of a film with zero character development for the supporting cast and a shallow narrative painted over a faux black."
tt0114369,"Yet another American movie where absolutely EVERYthing is put before you. Please, leave you brain turn off, you won't need it. There is no subtelty, no inference, no need to evoke imagination. It's all vomited up for the dummest of the dumb (clearly Americans need to be spoon fed). It's about a serial killer (boring been done to death). I found the music upsetting as it meant I had to have the volume low so I didn't jump out of my skin in the scenes where the sound suddenly was fortissimo; then it was hard to hear the dialogue, so turn the volume up. Yikes. David Fincher was supposed to have filmed the entire thing in ""dim light"". Um, ok ... yet another aspect of ""dinner is dished up..."" (turn off your imaginations). The acting is superb? Really (now I really love Morgan Freeman but not in this). Brad Pitt, he was acting? Hard to say. A big dump of s_h_i_t vomited up for the lowest common denominator."
tt0137523,"One of the worst movies that I have seen in recent years.  The story is all over the place and depressing as hell.  I thought the movie was about underground fighting and betting on it.  Unfortunately, it is about an idiot's ideal of the darker side of his life.  I like Brad Pitt and Ed Norton, but I would rather watch Seven or Primal Fear over and over again than watch another minute of Fight Club."
tt0114369,"I don't really get this movie, it is met with such high acclaim,yet it doesn't really have anything to show for it.From the start i didn't like it,the tone is incessantly bland,the visuals are dull,they never even attempt to give any excitement to the audience,as if the story alone was enough to keep us entertained. The entire movie is a good concept with a disappointing realization, the series of murders influenced by the seven deadly sins and even though one or two cases do tend to shock and entertain us,altogether it's not as thrilling as it should be. As for the characters,Brad Pitt is horrible in this movie,it's like he forgot how to act,he never acts out the appropriate emotion and the last scene where he finds his wife's head in the box looked more like annoyance and disgust than shock,fear and trauma; of course,nihilism might have been the direction they were going to,another question pops in mind: ""Should a death of a loved one be a nihilistic reaction?"". Kevin Spacey's character would have been amazing if it weren't for his lack of motivation, his role was supposed to be that of an insane mastermind,but wouldn't he then have a better motive than an ""I wanna be famous"" attitude?In conclusion it's a bad movie,I see why people do tend do enjoy it for it has some noteworthy scenes,but the fact is that it mostly relies on build-up and shock,while the outcome is predictable,the atmosphere is boring and the ending is too rushed."
tt0068646,"The Godfather is arguably the most over-rated movie ever made. To be fair it is a technical feast, with impressive period design, and the music is memorable, but nothing else is. Pacino is dull, Keaton is forgettable, Duvall goes through the motions, and the script lacks the punch it probably had in 1972. Goodfellas, in one movie, tells the same rise and fall story that The Godfather has over three movies in a far more enjoyable and vivid way."
tt0167261,"I have loved Tolkien's masterpiece since I was 10 years old. I bought the calendars by Brothers Hildebrandt all through college, and I have eagerly awaited the movies since they were announced some four years ago. I just saw the Extended ""Two Towers"" last night at the Seattle Cinerama, and I was absolutely stunned by how improved it is over the earlier edit (which I saw three times in theatres). As good as ""Fellowship"" is, I feel that the restored ""Two Towers"" blows it away.****** SPOILERS ******So many things that felt half-finished in ""TTT"" now contribute to the richness of detail that makes this such an epic. The stable scene with Brego, Aragorn, and Eowyn is pivotal in setting up several later scenes. The migration of the trees of Fangorn to Helm's Deep, the flashback to Boromir in Osgiliath, and Theodred's funeral all serve to bring the story much more in line with Tolkien's vision. Even the raiding of the stores by Merry and Pippin is wonderful, injecting some of the lightheartedness of ""Fellowship"" into what is a much darker story.****** END SPOILERS ******This trilogy will stand as a singular achievement in cinema history. In an era when many big-budget films are mindless, sadistic two-hour pageants of explosions and gunplay, it is remarkable that these films were made at all, let alone with such faithfulness to very complex source material. Bravo to New Line, Peter Jackson, Howard Shore, the entire crew, and of course the magnificent cast, especially Ian McKellen."
tt0133093,"The pre-millennium sci-fi boom can trace its roots back to the one, the only, 'The Matrix.' From the minds of the Wachowskis, the Keanu Reeves juggernaut left a lasting legacy on the genre and influenced many films that followed in its footsteps.The reason 'Matrix' works so well is because it is focused, stays within the lines and has a standalone storyline. The way we are introduced to Neo and see his story arc develop over the course of the film is reminiscent of that of Luke Skywalker's - the initial confusion about who he is, learning his skills and abilities, falling in love while trying to stay focused on his mission - all of these are key character drivers for ""the One."" The film also benefits from not being aware of how cool it is - something its sequels could have taken note of.But it's not just the Keanu show. Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving all deliver with memorable performances. In fact, these four lead actors could probably carry the entire story on their shoulders if they had to. The soundtrack is also unique in a new age, euro-grunge way that screams late 90s.Yes, it's conventional wisdom, but 'The Matrix' is one of the best sci-fi films to debut in the past 25 years, and should not be looked down upon based on its far-inferior offspring."
tt0372784,"I've seen all the Batman movies. Most aren't that deeply lodged in my memory. I know that the scene stealers in most of them are the villains. This movie puts it on the strong shoulders of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The movie is about him and his ghosts and his baggage. It is about a man coming to grips with immense guilt. It goes into great detail to explain to us how Batman came to be. It has verisimilitude. The bad guys are, of course, really exaggerated in their evil plans. Everything is neatly plotted. There is fragility in both the character of Wayne and the city he and his family loved. Organized crime abounds and he must face it pretty much alone. I was quite impressed with Inspector Gordon (Gary Oldmann). He was believable and fragile, yet committed to what was right amidst a culture of evil (even on the police force). Like is so often the case, I can't speak for the people who know these comics so well that they fall into depression when a movie doesn't follow their dictates; yet, I really was involved in this. This is quite an all star cast with excellent direction with a bleakness that Tim Burton also did well. I think it was one of last year's best films."
tt0480025,"In sections this film is incredibly difficult to watch.And the reason for that is it's so accurate. The guy playing combat must have known skinheads as a kid and he's right on the mark.All the actors in this are amazing.The costumes are spot on, everyone looks authentic eighties. Shaun is like so many boys I know and I can totally relate to him (though I was a 2-tone rude boy myself, not a skinhead) I do struggle to watch certain parts as it is so close to reality.I knew people like this, I grew up with people like this. I lived on an estate like this, I went to school with people like this.It's not just close to correct, it's correct.Watch this and love it."
tt0137523,"Fight  Club  begins  with  a  promising  half  hour  and  falls  downhill from  there . Edward  Norton  gives  a  brilliant  performance  as  a depressed  office  worker  driven  by  capitalism . He  narrates  the film , guiding  us  through  his  pathetic  and  hopeless  life . I  was immediately  taken  in  by  the  movie's  slick  visual  style , and Norton's  performance  is  especially  convincing . It  is  here  the movie begins  to  crumble . Funny  how  it's  possible  to  pinpoint  the exact moment  when  it  starts  to  turn  sour . It  is  when  Norton  meets Brad Pitt's  character  on  an  airplane . He's  a  neo-facist  who  teaches self-liberation  through  violence . Norton  is  intrigued  and  joins his group  of  recruits  who  act  out  their  rage  by  pounding  on  each other  in  dark  cellars . Once  Norton  moves  in  with  Pitt  the  movie begins  to  pander  and  get  off  track . It  becomes  more  like watching a  very  bloody  remake  of  The  Odd  Couple . I  was  still  hopeful though , until  the  film  self-destructs  with  a  contrived  suprise ending  that's  totally  contradictory  to  many  of  its  earlier  events . The  suprise  endings  of  Magnolia  and  The  Sixth  Sense  worked , because  they  interlocked  with  their  themes , but  the  ending  in Fight  Club  looks  like  it  was  added  on  just  to  give  it  a  kick . Then  there's  the  final  scene ,  which  is  illogical  and  serves only as  a  cop-out , as  the  movie  ducks  responsibility  to  its  real theme , Norton's  unstable  mental  condition . The  material  was  here  for  a compelling  film , but  Fight  Club  never  explores  it . Instead , it falls  into  standard , formulized  Hollywood  mush . Seeing  Fight  Club , I  realized  you  can  have  great  ideas  for  films , but  unless  you use  them  well , and  find  just  the  right  note , great  ideas  do not necessarily  make  great  movies ."
tt0139414,"Just watched it for the 4th time since it's realise.This is called a horrer film it's fine to call it that but the comedic elements makes it both,it starts with a women sent to Maine to check out what killed someone in the lake she is joined by a sheriff and fishers and game guy(bill Pullman) I love his movies,then joined by a millionaire crock hunter (Olliver platter) who's great,they set up camp and hunt whatever is in the lake,the movie is great fun with comedy and a little gore,the ingredients are here for a film which is well worth the time to watch, Olliver platt to the sheriff I like to be candid with people your fat lol and Betty White turns in a gem for her part.8/10."
tt0110912,"Half the people I know liked the movie, the other didn't.  I'm in the latter group. I'm not sure what it was that I missed that the first group picked up on, but I was bored with it. I felt it had a lot of lengthy, boring, scenes & dialog. I was unimpressed with the acting, not that it was bad but it just didn't grab me. I won't say not see it, but rather make up your own mind.Many in this group liked it so check it out, you may be in the first half I talked about."
tt1130884,"Martin Scorcese has laid many cinematic landmarks in crime genre, and as a result, has earned a spot as one of the most influential directors to ever step foot in Hollywood. He has been met with much critical acclaim with his gritty portrayal of the gangster life in his film such as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York, and The Departed. Teaming up with his frequent collaborator Leonardo Dicaprio, Scorcese takes a more dark and surreal direction in this psychological thriller set with plenty of twists and turns. Leonardo Dicaprio plays U.S Marshal Teddy Daniels, who travels across seas to investigate a mysterious and deserted island along with his partner Chucke Aule (played by Mark Ruffalo). There lies a hospital run by Dr. Cawley (played by Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Neahring (played by Max Von Sydow) holding mentally insane prisoners, where Daniels and Aule are in search of a patient named Rachel who has mysteriously disappeared. Going further into their investigation, the two quickly turn the dark and sinister secrets behind the wretched prison of a hospital, soon to the point where Daniels deteriorating of his mental state and his identity all together.Mixing elements of neo noir and elements of pure horror, this film conveys a dark and surreal plot that unfolds to something truly shocking and well crafted in a unique way. The psychological elements conveyed throughout the story go very deep in ways that may remind those who seen films like 'Seven' or 'The Sixth Sense' as these both deal with individuals who are psychological damaged. This film paces steadily through one spine- chilling thrill after another, and as the story progresses, the tone gets more and more eerie; building up an astonishing plot twist at the end that is likely to leave you startled. Like David Fincher's 'Seven', this film never lightens up in tone, giving you the feeling of hopelessness throughout its run time, yet it's still entertaining. The plot doesn't go without its flaws however. The film has its moments where gets overly convoluted to the point I could leave you scratching your head. Ultimately, the plot picks up not to soon before it reaches its grim climax.Leonardo Dicaprio has been one of my favorite actors for as long I can remember, an actors always shows off powerful performances, yet has never landed an Oscar for his works. His performance as the main character Teddy Daniels is terrific. He is very charismatic throughout, especially when his character go through some spine-chilling changes. Mark Ruffalo who plays his partner also deserves some applause for his performance, playing his role very solid and willfully. Ruffalo is who I believe is an underrated actor and hope garners an Oscar one day (as well as Dicaprio).Shutter Island is a twisted, but stunning piece of entertainment by Martin Scorcese, complete with a terrific screenplay, powerful performances, and a strong narrative that grabs your attention. This is much different than the typical Scorcese fare. Nonetheless, it is astonishingly entertaining."
tt0108052,"The black and white film was a poor choice that eliminated the potential for any visual mastery since Spielberg isn't very good with black and white filming. There simply isn't any beautiful imagery or camera work in this film, a lot of intense set pieces (luggage stacked up, etc) but the camera glides by real quick in a hurry. It's a strange choice not to loom over the set a little longer, considering it is a 3 hour long picture.In the end it is very boring. The first hurdle is the acting level, Leem Neeson just isn't very good. Then this is emphasized by the poor accent from Ralph Finnes, the conversations between the two come across very poorly rehearsed and amateurish.What echoes the filming quality and acting quality is nearly all the scenes with extras, all seeming to be amateurs and not actors with any chops at all. I saw straight through it all, in some scenes the extras are smiling. This is supposed two be the persecution of the Jewish people from the Nazis... Why the heck are people smiling without any context? Also if they are not smiling they are just normal faced, not distressed, angry, confused, in pain or otherwise.This is mirrored by the one dimensional antagonist, who spends nearly every second on film shooting random Jews. It is extremely contrived and I don't believe a single frame of it. This is poorly researched crap made into popcorn material for the sake of pulling emotional strings. Well, it didn't work on me.If you want to see some real mastery and horror shown in this topic then I recommend 'Conspiracy', A HBO for TV movie on a secret meeting that pushes forward the plans for the death trains and concentration death camps... that will blow you away. Failing this, I would recommend Band of Brothers, a ten part mini series that covers american soldiers going to the front lines in WW2.I give this a 5/10 as an average film. Usually this rating and below I give to films I would never watch again, including this one."
tt0172495,"This is wonderful storytelling.  The opening Battle Scene simply mesmerizes, showing the brutal nature of combat for Roman conquests.  I went back to see the film again.  The first time I didn't hear anything Crowe said before the battle.  I was just too visually caught-up.  The second time I listened very closely and caught the wise yet succinct line from Maximus ""what we do in life... echoes in eternity.""  Awesome.A simple man v. an emperor.  I just loved the resilience Maximus showed throughout the movie.  I find in most movies, there is an irritatingly slow process where the character has to ""find himself,"" not so with Gladiator. Maximus does what is needed.I liked how there were only two or three issues within this film.  One was the afterlife.  Aspects of the afterlife are opened, but not overdone.  Love of family is given sizable focus. I liked the theme of love of country that we see as well, although it may not be justly deserved, it is never questioned.The visual effects were amazing.  It actually had me wanting to believe that's the way Rome actually looked in all it's glory.  The battle of Carthage reenactment was really great.The ending is just hypnotic. Intentionally or unintentionally it was simply emotional.  The music is wonderfully beautiful as if Maximus' family are telling him...you have arrived.Bottom line: magnificent.  Visually and emotionally satisfying."
tt0120737,"When I first read ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy back in the early 1970's, I recall saying to myself that the story would make a wonderful movie. ""Star Wars"" still hadn't come out yet, and realizing that the available technology could not do justice to the fantastic world presented by J.R.R. Tolkien, it was simply best left to the imagination.Well, imagination has found life in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", a truly profound epic that sets the standard for film fantasy, just as the books did for the written word. Upon first seeing it during it's initial release, I couldn't have been happier with the amount of detail it offered while remaining true to the original adventure. Everyone imagines what a story and characters look like in their own mind; it was as if Peter Jackson tapped a great cosmic consciousness to deliver a tale that captured the tone and pacing of the novel dead on.I feel that readers of the trilogy have a leg up on the characters and locations of Middle Earth, as they are revealed in the film quickly and with nominal explanation. For example, when the Black Riders appear for the first time, it's difficult to grasp what they're all about, other than the fact that they're after the ring. Strider's explanation of the Nazgul is perfect - ring wraiths who were once men, neither alive nor dead, who always feel the power of the ring. Coming to the movie with that understanding ahead of time helps the viewer have a greater appreciation of the action taking place.The real magic of the movie for me is the seamless manner in which the various races coexist and interact with each other. Though levels of unfamiliarity and distrust appear, can anyone coming out of the movie doubt that elves, dwarfs, hobbits and wizards actually exist. Even orcs and evil Uruk hai have a place in this world, for without the danger they pose there is no triumph.If the movie captures your imagination and you haven't read the trilogy or it's prequel ""The Hobbit"", you'll be doing yourself a favor to do so. There in even more exquisite detail are nuances such as Elvish poetry and additional characters that provide more depth and color to the world of Middle Earth. It's a world easy to get lost in, and makes one appreciate a writer of legendary proportion who invented a land, people, and language all of his own that can now be shared with everyone."

In the early 1600, the long ruling Ming Dynasty has been overthrown, and the Manchurian invaders from the north have taken over the sovereignty, beginning what is known as the Ching Dynasty, and a highly oppressive reign thus begins. In order to prevent rebels developing revolutionary plots, the newly set-up government immediately imposes a ruthless emergency martial law, ordering all martial art practitioners to turn in their weapons to district officials. Those who fail to do so will be considered committing a serious crime and would result to immediate execution. But soon enough, people would discover that even if they were to obey the law and turn in their weapon, their fate is equally in dire. Wind Fire, a surrendered military official from the previous dynasty, sees this as an opportunity to make a fortune for himself by helping to execute the new law. After endless massacres, Wind Fire next goal is to attack the final frontier, the village of Bowei Fortress.""Seven Swords"" is set in 17th century Western China, where the greedy Manchurian leader Fire-Wind is intent on increasing both his coffers and his power. Hence, he sends his vicious henchmen and women out to plunder and pillage any small town that they set foot in. The horses seem to snarl and heads roll, literally. Overseas fans of ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and ""House Of Flying Daggers"" will find much to enjoy here, for Hark's villains are clearly dangerous and compelling, reminiscent of bloodthirsty goth rockers. Cold weather and the real life settings of Turfan and Xianjing add to the gritty realism.Yet when Fire-Wind's men threaten Martial Village, the last outpost in Northwestern China, retired executioner Fu Zingzhu decides that he must round up some people to stop their murderous ways. He then recruits villagers Wu Yuanyin (Charlie Young) and Han Zhibeng) to travel to the mythical Mount Heaven to seek help. Once there, Chu Zhaonan, Yang Yunchong, Mulang and Xin Longzi agree to help stop Fire-Wind, and use specially made swords in their attempt. But things aren't as easy as they seem. It's seven men against Fire-Wind's army of hundreds. There are more complications for the group as one of them falls in love with the doomed Green Pearl, a beautiful Korean woman who is Fire-Wind's mistress against her will. For male viewers, Hark offers plenty of well choreographed martial arts influenced fight scenes. Females will revel in the film's epic adventurism, hints of a love story and breathtaking settings. Critics overseas are likely to praise the film as well, likening it to visual poetry which spreads itself out for nearly three hours.The casting of veteran local singer/actor Leon Lai has raised some eyebrows, as he is better known as of late for local phone commercials than he has been for his film choices. However, he fares well here as Yang Yunchong, a well intentioned but flawed hero who wishes to dethrone Fire-Wind. Equally baffling was the casting of his co-star Charlie Young, best known of late for her appearances in fitness ads. Yet as Wu Yuanyin, she too fares admirably. However, much of the film's most memorable star heat certainly belongs to Sun Hong Lei's Fire-Wind, as well as Donnie Yen and Korean actress Kim So Yuen. Collectively, the trio make the most of their conflicted personalities, and it's their actions, glances and deeds that viewers will remember long after the credits have run. High production values and beautiful mountainous settings will also warrant repeat viewings amongst particularly avid viewers.""Seven Swords"" is said to be based on Lian Yu Shen's classic book. With characters and conflicts of the time firmly entrenched by film's end, Hark has been quoted as saying that ""Seven Swords"" could be to this decade what the ""Once Upon A Time In China"" series could be to the 90s. Let's hope so. For this film is an extremely bright beacon for Hong Kong cinema in 2005."

tt7286456,"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer. This movie is terrible."
tt0114369,"Oh my god! Current rating 8.7 and # 28 on top 250 list...!! I think many of IMDb users have gone out of their mind to vote 10, 9 & 8 to such a ridiculous crap.Yes, it is a fact that i do believe in the voting system of IMDb and it is absolutely true that i consult the reviews of this site before watching most of the films. In 95% of cases my judgment gone true. On the basis of rating and reviews i got disappointed only with two films. One is Se7en and the other is Once upon a time in the West (1968).Some of the IMDb users are also claiming Se7en to be the best work of David Fincher till date. But i don't think so... Fight Club (1999) is the best work of Fincher till date. It doesn't matter to me what others think about this review of mine but this is not a classic to be rated so high.""The god inspired and ordered a person to eliminate those 7 people who are indulging themselves to the 7 deadly sins of the universe."" I do admire the insane attitude of the killer but the plot and the entire story was full of flaws. Like in most of the psychological thrillers here also the lead actors failed to read and analyze the mind of the killer. In every crime committed by the killer... he stayed two steps ahead of the detectives. And yes the climax itself was one of the worst i have ever seen.Watch it only if you are a strong fan of crime thrillers otherwise not! Self - interpretation by the viewer after watching the film is the most important thing... 4/10....I can't vote it more than that.."
tt0167260,"This movie only makes the top 250 because the average movie goer was wowed by the nice digital effects and the nice (if somewhat boring) cinematography. However, this movie had no story just as so many critics have stated about Tolkien's trilogy (please check the reception history of Tolkien's novels if you don't believe me-- I teach English). Tolkien was a mediocre writer at best and this trilogy translates into a mediocre bore-fest. I have never seen more effort put into such a boring story. Tolkien's 3 tomes could have been summed up in about five paragraphs but it seems that Peter Jackson is just as long winded as JRR. These three films have about enough story material to make an interesting short film. Jorge Luis Borges would have been horrified to see such a travesty of pointless, long-winded storytelling."
tt0068646,"Pros:
Solid from a technical level, very serviceable camerawork
Lighting is remarkably nice in some scenes
Action parts can be effectively brutal
Extras are fun to watchCons:
Approximately 100 scenes that lacked anything entertaining or worth watching
Very little diversity in characters, the range of character writing is remarkably small
Main plot is uninteresting, side plots go nowhere
Deaths aren't usually given the gravity they deserve, very little reaction from characters
Too padded for its own goodBest part: the baptism scene
Worst part: any scene in the old country, maybe the part when his wife died and he was like whatever"
tt0103103,"First I have seen True Lies, with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis, which I liked a lot. Then, reading some Magazine critiques, I have discovered that it was actually a remake of the French ""La Totale!"", and how good that one was. Because the usual situation is the following: you see a European (mostly French) movie with a great idea, original pictures and superb acting with not so known but excellent actors, then Hollywood makes a disappointing copy of it with big money and low-quality actors.Well, the original version was way under my expectations - average actors, low budget. Also, as I knew the story from before, the originality of the idea did not work here. So it was just an average French movie for me, with an entertainment level comparable to a good episode of the Knight Rider series. I believe that an action movie first of all needs budget for the big explosions, fights, car racing, which obviously was missing in the French studio. Miou-Miou, playing Helene, the wife, makes such an excellent interpretation of the stupid narrow minded wife. However, Thierry Lhermitte, as the super action hero secret agent, was miserable, no big muscles, no radiation of power, no big karate fights; and others perform even worse.So funnily, the remake, True Lies is classes better and is an excellent action movie. Probably you should forget about watching La Totale! after seeing True Lies - it can be then a major disappointment for you too, as it was for me. 5/10"
tt0109830,"Let me start out with I love Tom Hanks, and I love the simplex movies he tends to star in. I don't have any complaints about the movie, in terms of cinematography, actors, or premise/theme. This review is about a specific character. That character is Jenny.I strongly dislike Jenny and now I will go into detail.Let me start out by saying, the way they wrote her character is oddly realistic in my opinion and that's part of the reason I have any judgement about her at all. As a teen (first time I saw the movie), I didn't understand why Jenny was so reckless, but now I understand that it stems from her childhood.However, this is where it begins fumbling for me. Jenny went to college. This means that she has an understanding that hard-work and effort will bring some form of success. With that being said, it VEXES me how she treats Forest. She treats him horribly. She does not owe him anything in the first place, so her constant toxic, recurring and random appearances in his life are exactly that.After meeting so many men that treated her bad, you would think she would have given him an actual chance earlier on. Forest, although ""mentally challenged"" had about the same understanding about the world around him as any other male his age. He was well-built and attractive, and conversational. It makes sense, in an aspect, that because she was abused; she constantly searches for comfort in men that hurt or abuse her. It also doesn't, because again, she went to college. She had in her mind that she owed herself more, and then gives that away.Whether directly or indirectly, she's manipulating Forest throughout the movie and this is supported by her eventually having a child with him. Why have a child with someone you don't take seriously UNLESS you feel like they are benefitting you in some aspect? It's frustrating to watch her take advantage of his simple mind. She knows what she's doing. She's operating on a level, he can't comprehend, which is again -manipulation.She has no sense of self, and apparently no empathy either. If being abused has caused her to seek negative partners, behave dangerously, and more; then why would she constantly push her way into Forest's life at random times? And if she's behaving unconsciously, with no intentions (or unknowingly) because she was abused, then why is she able to spend time with other people and give them her quality time?Jenny is a careless, and a bit of a heartless individual, and her character irritates me off."
tt0120737,"I watched the extended version of a meager 3.5 hours. Having seen snippets of the movie when it came out on DVD and friends were watching it, I couldn't be bothered. I had read so many fantasy books over the years, and generally I tended to be disappointed by any novel that was made into a movie, for instance most of the adapted masterpieces written by Stephen King are mediocre at best; Only later I was able to enjoy adaptations, first one that comes to mind is Birdy with Nicholas Cage.Back to Fantasy, I had given Tolkien a try when I was too young, collapsing under its' volume. Later I reread it and loved it, so given the effort I put into it, I didnt wat it to be tainted by a sub par undertaking. And yes the raving reviews were pretty much in my face, but when time goes on, well, you know... That.So now, in 2022 I took the time to watch it, be it in parts as I don't have 3.5 hours to spare anymore unfortunately, and it was overwhelmingly beautiful! It is so long and there is so much to tell, that it borders on tedious at times, but the investment is so big you have to finish, you can't let it go! And the payoff is massive, and I have to say the most human among the fellowship, the human played by Sean Bean, brought tears to my eyes. I even had to gasp for air, what a performance! Amazingly well done.Over 20 years later, and the movie is still rock solid, nothing waned, not the visual effects, not the vision of all the different worlds, nothing looks out of whack, but spot on and suspending disbelief is not a thing at all, throughout the entire length of the movie. You are there, with them.I have to tip my hat to Peter Jackson, and curse him at the same time. If the other two parts are as well done, I'm afraid I will have a massive sleep deprivation issue once done."
tt1853728,"This is a movie that wouldn't work with every other director other than Tarantino.
Just like all of his movies, film making top tier.
Every aspect of this film is amazing"
tt0848228,"The score, the CGI, the writing, the humor, all of it is just top notch!Especially the legendary scene where Tony Stark falls out of the building and the suit activates and builds around him, not a scene to forget. The scenes where he lands at the Stark Tower landing pad and the machines automatically took off his suit is also unforgettable. How all of the agents have different plans, and how this will create conflict, but at the end, when they defeat Loki, they are together again. This movie also serves a major purpose as all of these people have met each other for the first time.If you have watched all of the other Avengers movies, it is pretty funny to see how they have grown with each other. The theme song, composed by Alan Silvestri took this movie to a whole new level. And how this theme song evolved in the later Avengers movies. Even hearing it now gives me chills."
tt1345836,"The problems with this mess of a movie are endless. Mainly, it's just boring and completely unbelievable...and way too long. There's not nearly enough Batman and, when he is on screen, he mostly gets his ass kicked. Meanwhile the villains are capable of doing everything successfully. As a result, Batman just comes off as tired and lame. The movie's war scenes smack more of Iron Man than Dark Knight. The movie desperately tries to prove how bad-ass Bane is, but he's just...not. Truly, I expected a scene with Bane loading cancer surviving, crippled grandmas into a bus and blowing them up. It was that silly. All the subplots slow things down: I could care less about the backstory of the chick with the accent, Robin (gee, I didn't see that coming two hours before it happened), the corporate stuff, Alfred's blubbering. Dull, dull, dull. Lastly, the sound is amateur. Everything is pushed up front, so it's often difficult to understand dialogue. Just a disorganized mess."
tt0468569,"I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.*Runs*The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it?We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reason¬óbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips?Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the ""yang"" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the ""yin""; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them¬Ö) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven."
tt1853728,"Last week I managed to watch Django Unchained and I have to say that I am a little disappointed about what on the screen happened. I expected an outstanding movie which presents well done dialogs, awesome screenplay and compelling atmosphere.In my opinion none of the points above were fulfilled. This was Tarantinos worst done movie. Just too cheesy and low for being nominated for an academy award. Compared to the previous movies, Django Unchained is a boring nearly 3 hour torture. Everybody in my environment is keen about Django, but I can not understand why. Hopefully Kill Bill 3 will be better than Django Unchained! Sorry Django, 4/10"
tt0167260,"I'm very much a fan of the books, but I feel the movie must stand on it's own.  And in this case, I feel the movie didn't quite succeed.To make a movie based on a book, the writer/director must take liberties with the story.  They must cut back drastically to fit the time constraints and sometimes will add to fill in gaps or to make the story more accessible for the current audience.  I've no problem with either.  The movie is not the book.  The movie must be judged not by how it much it supplements or is faithful to the book but on it's own merit.  And knowledge of the book should not be used to gloss over problems with the movie.My main problem with this movie is in the number of major storylines (according to the movie!) that are not sufficiently fleshed out.  Some examples:** BEGIN SPOILERS **Denethor.  Ok...he's crazy...I guess.  But based upon what we learn FROM THE MOVIE we haven't a clue way.  Maybe there was a line by Gandolf somewhere that hinted at it, but good story-telling provides stronger revelations than another character saying why things are they way they are.  And what was with his love for Boromir instead of Faramir?  The movie didn't explain it to me, so I never really got it.Faramir.  We see a lot of him, and we actually are given reasons to care about him.  So why doesn't the movie give us a more satisfying resolution to his story than a 1 second pan across him in a crowd with Eowyn...who also deserved a better resolution.  We get 30 minutes of post-ring endings. Couldn't they get maybe 20-30 seconds?  And did I miss something?  When did they even meet?Eowyn.  She gives Aragorn some food at an encampment and thinks they're dating?  Maybe I forgot something from TTT, but I never really saw Aragorn give her much more than the time of day, so she must be delusional to think there's something between them.  And Aragorn broke up with her even though he never really liked her?  Huh?** END SPOILERS **My second problem with this movie is the ending.  I blame Lucas for what I call ""the Stars Wars ending"".  After the climax, show a group photo with everyone standing around smiling at each other without any dialog.  And for greater impact, add a large mass of people who are watching!  This is the cinematic equivalent to ""...and they lived happily ever after"".  It's cheap and meaningless.  It may work for Snow White and Cinderella (and even Stars Wars : A New Hope), but not for anything with more substance than that. Good storytelling doesn't resort to cheap tricks like this.** BEGIN SPOILERS **An epic of this magnitude requires a much more satisfying ending.  We became involved with a number of characters and want to know how things ended for them.  In response, it appears that RotK gives us at least three Stars Wars endings (the bed, the coronation, the bar) before giving us something real. Cut the sugar-sappy Star Wars endings and jump right to the Shire and the departure of Frodo and Bilbo and it'd clean up the movie tremendously.(Good storytelling can also choose to NOT resolve storylines...leaving it up to the viewer to ponder.  For that, this movie would have ended with Frodo/Sam stranded on Mt Doom after destruction of the ring.  I usually prefer endings like that, but it wouldn't work for this story.)** END SPOILERS **30 minutes is a short period of time to give us closure on all the storylines, so use the time wisely.  Maybe even cut 10 minutes out of the battle (GASP!) and resolve ALL the storylines for us.I rate the movie 6.5/10 : 1 point off for incomplete major storylines, 1 point for cheapening the movie with multiple Star Wars endings, half a point for the whole Agent Elrond character (ala Matrix), half a point for non-imaginative Stars Wars knock-off battle scenes (including the Daredevil/Legolas acrobatics), half a point for some other miscellaneous gaffs too numerous and varied to elaborate on each.Final conclusion: Eye-candy can't substitute for real story telling. Skip the theatrical release and wait for the Extended Edition DVD.  Maybe then they'll get it right."
tt0816692,"The first 80-90% of ""Interstellar"" I absolutely loved and was prepared to give this movie a 10. Sadly, the ending inexplicably had an ending that didn't make a lot of sense and only seemed there in order to tack on a nice Hollywood ending and wrap everything up perfectly. It's sad, but apparently the public embraced this sort of ending...so who am I to complain?!As for the film, there are a bazillion reviews so I will be brief. The film has incredible special effects and is a film best seen in the movie theater. On a HUGE screen at home, it would still lose something. Like the wonderful ""Gravity"", it just needs the big screen...trust me with this. The story is exceptional and offers many wonderful twists (up until the disappointing ending that is) and there are a lot of wonderful performances. Overall, the good certainly outweighs the bad and it's a film to see. But as for me, an ending with more sadness and vagueness would have been okay."
tt0068646,"In the spring of 1968, Paramount Pictures bought Mario Puzo's novel treatment ""The Godfather"" for $12,500 against $75,000 if it became a finished book. When filming of it began three years later, the relatively unknown Francis Ford Coppola was hired to direct. Coppola had just made the box-office failure ""The Rain People"", so Paramount counted on him to be malleable and work for a fairly low salary.The movie opens in New York City in the late 1940s. The youngest son of a powerful Mafia boss returns from service in the war to find himself slowly being drawn into the family's brutal business.Unfortunately Coppola and Paramount fell out with each other immediately. The director wanted Marlon Brando as the Mafia boss, but the movie company firmly opposed that choice. They meant that the actor was hopelessly pass√© and that he also was extremely difficult to work with. But, after being threatened with dismissal several times, Coppola finally got his way and was able to hire Brando.The row flared up again when Coppola explained that he intended to travel to Sicily to shoot the scenes where Michael Corleone is in Italy. Paramount Pictures responded by contacting veteran director Elia Kazan, asking him to take over the film. The situation didn't calm down until Coppola showed the executives at Paramount some of his beautiful and exciting rushes from the Mediterranean island.The movie opened in five theaters in the New York area before moving to over 300 theaters nationwide. And it was breaking records everywhere. Later the same year the film overtook the previous all-time box office champion, ""Gone With the Wind"". In 1998, the American Film Institute then named ""The Godfather"" one of the greatest American movies ever made, testifying to its enduring artistic legacy. Francis Ford Coppola's triumph was complete."

tt0372784,"It's been a long time since I've seen the Tim Burton Batman films, heck, it's been a long time since I've seen this one when it first came out. But after seeing all three of the Dark Knight incarnations under Christopher Nolan, I'd have to say that his vision best defines the comic book character that evolved over the past decade. I never cared for the campy Adam West version of the mid-Sixties TV series, and even looking back at the early comic book stories, the appeal of the character was always geared more toward a kid's eye view of good guys triumphing over bad guys. With ""Batman Begins"" the character enters the adult world as a complex hero/anti-hero with conflicting emotions and a motivation in precarious balance between justice and revenge.Before the film came out I didn't know much about Christian Bale, and upon first viewing he didn't seem right for the Batman role, but watching today I think he fits it rather well. The only thing is, I'm put off somewhat by the look of the cowl that covers Batman's face. It's the one thing that hearkens back to a cartoony feel about the character and it's somewhat distracting for me. In fact, the whole idea of a rubberized Batman suit seems antithetical to the the early comic stories where the look of the character appeared more natural. One has to wonder how a real person would be able to move around in something like that.But when it comes to super-heroes, I enjoy origin stories and this one does it right. Beginning with the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents right up through his training under Ra's al Ghul, one gains an appreciation for the dedication and determination required to become a skilled warrior. Not to mention the mental and physical conditioning required to block out pain and exhaustion, an important element in creating the character.In addition to Bale, I found the supporting cast to be quite effective in their roles. Particularly intriguing was Cillian Murphy as Dr. Crane. He didn't have as much screen time as some of the other players, but that crazed gleam in his eye made him believable as the founder of Arkham Asylum. Katie Holmes looked a bit young to be portraying the assistant DA of a major city like Gotham, but that could just be me. I liked Michael Caine as Alfred, a worthy collaborator in the Batman mystique and a trusted friend and adviser. All the rest were good too, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, and Rutger Hauer - all exceedingly competent and well cast for their characters."
tt0816692,"It's difficult to put into words how powerful this film is. In fact, I'd go as far to say as this is so much more than just a film. After watching this, you somehow feel as if you've experienced a whole lifetime in a mere 3 hours. There isn't a single moment that goes unwasted; everything is purposeful.This is a sci-fi film in which the 'fi' part enables the film to convery so many powerful messages. It puts just the right amout of focus on science without trying too hard to explain or prove itself. To me, one of the most powerful effects this film has left me with is the concept of impermanence. Our time on this world is finite and we should cherish and embrace it as much as we can. The film also fiddles with the concept of time and uses it as an integral part of the plot. But perhaps the most powerful message of this film is of the human condition. Yes, as humans we have our shortcomings. But we can also show remarkable empathy, dedication and ingenuity.I would be lying if I said I wasn't highly emotional while watching this film. In fact, I found myself breaking into tears several times throughout the film. I know this review wasn't very analytical - I will say the following though: this film is so immersive and well done that you forget you're watching a film. The acting is simply superb and believable at all times. Reviewing this without talking about the audio and the music would be a great disservice. The film is accompanied by one of the most brilliant soundtracks. From a composition perspective, it might seem that there isn't a lot going on in the music. But the power of the soundtrack is in its simplicity and the emotions it manages to evoke.I will end this review by saying that I truly think this film has made me a better person in some sense. It reminded me of how powerful humans can be, and how we should use our finite time on this planet to care and be empathic towards each other and our planet."
tt0110912,"I just had to take a minute and comment on this film. I think it was shockingly bad. I really like Tarantino's other films/True Romance is a masterpiece. then he goes and makes this disjointed piece of crap? I guess people get bored telling a good, simple story like. Uma Thurman stole every scene she was in. John Travolta was revolting and I was embarrassed for him trying so hard to act so cool throughout this thing. give me a break!! the whole thing with the rape defines gratuitous violence for the sake of what? trying to prove how tough someone can be? yeah, OK. the whole movie had this trying-desperately-hard-to-be-ultra-cool. all I can say is this film is OVERKILL in a big way. some scenes are OK but most of it should have been scraped. that people like this film as much as they do is a sad commentary on good film making and what people now a days will call brilliant. it's all a.d.d./mtv-pandering to those with the attention span of a gnat."
tt0133093,"You walk into this film not knowing what the Matrix is. You take your seat and watch the trailers. The green Warner Brothers (green? you ask) trademark comes up, and without warning you are thrust into the Wachowski brothers grand vision. 2 hours of excitement later, you stumble out of the cinema, knowing what the Matrix is.This is one great movie. Keanu Reeves is cooler than cool as Neo. The Wachowski brothers skilful direction is brilliant. The special effects sequences will blow you away, did I mention the government lobby scene?The film starts off with a 'what is real?' first half, and then the first kung-fu sequence makes way for an action- packed, John Woo-esque second half with slomo and style cranked up all the way to the top. Did I mention the government lobby scene?Keanu becomes Cool Keanu, Carrie-Anne Moss is a real find and Hugo Weaving is perfect in his against typecasting role as the evil Agent Smith.You may notice in this review that I have not revealed what the Matrix is. Like the trailer says, 'You have to see it for yourself.'Excellent. Best film of '99. 9/10."
tt0816692,"'Memento' and 'Inception' had some problems, but their ideas stretched the imagination. 'Interstellar' only delivers the bombastic silliness one would expect if a puffed-up Batman director thought he could eclipse Kubrick's '2001' with a puerile adventure story. Christopher Nolan's new film begins badly and steadily declines as its long-winded prologue introduces the stereotypical elements of a Steven Spielberg/Norman Rockwell Sci-Fi co-production - a widowed ex-astronaut farmer, his chiseled jaw, a feisty daughter, a crusty grandpa, a dying Earth, dust storms, paranormal activity, baseball, cornfields - and lots of corn.After about an hour - which seems like two - a valiant crew lifts off in search of a planet to save humanity. Once they've journeyed through an intergalactic wormhole, the implausibility dimension expands to cosmic levels. Scientific hocus-pocus is stirred into the sentimental sludge as gigantic tsunamis, deranged astronauts, spaceship chases, time travel tomfoolery and black hole baloney eventually lead to a schmaltzy Hallmark-style climax. The visual effects are above average, but far short of awesome. When all is said and done, the film's self-importance and mawkishness leave one rooting for humanity's extinction."
tt0133093,"... I don't know how long.  Probably that's why it didn't do as well as big, dumb, lumbering things like ""Independence Day"" and ""The Phantom Menace"", and a dozen or so films I didn't bother to watch.Much of what you will have heard about this film is false.  You will have heard that the premise is that we're all prisoners in a virtual reality world; but the premise is not that WE are prisoners in a virtual reality world - it's a good deal more interesting than that.  You will have heard that it's hip and cynical; but thankfully, it's neither.  You will have heard the word ""cyberpunk"" being used, with the odd allusion to films like ""The Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Blade Runner""; but it's NOT pretentious, deep-breathing, tawdry angst of that kind at all.  It's really quite charming once you get to know it.  Beneath all the up-to-the-minute computer gimcracks lies a gentle and trusting heart.The central character is played by Keanu Reeves, and I retract my claim that there's no use for the man.  Indeed he acts rather well.  Admittedly he plays a character who spends most of the film, and indeed most of his life, with the air of someone who (in the words of another character) isn't worried because he expects to wake up soon; but being able to do this well is being able to do something well.  Besides, we spend the opening half being at least half as bewildered as he is - even if we've read the plot synopsis.  When the set-up is revealed in all its glory I admit that one or two details are a bit far fetched.  But I never felt that my intelligence was insulted in the way things had been revealed to me.Special effects are marvellous.  I don't think I've ever seen computer-generated images look this convincing - usually they disfigure a movie - and there are several reasons why they work so well.  A dark (but attractively dark) style of lighting shows them at their best. Psychological tricks - well-chosen camera angles, misdirection - are used to make us believe in what we see: no-one makes the assumption that George Lucas made in ""The Phantom Menace"", that software alone will do the trick. And more to the point, a story has been chosen where the kind of technology favoured by Hollywood these days is not out of place.  The air of vague phoniness that computer effects impart, the sense that something is deeply wrong, is exactly what we want in a story where something really IS deeply wrong.Only two things let the film down: the last couple of minutes (and after two fantastic hours I can forgive a little fumble at the end), and a HORRIBLY synthetic musical score, which seems to be there only to make us glad when it stops.  Luckily it stops often enough and it only succeeds in ruining one or two scenes.  I don't know - maybe this kind of musical pollution has been around for a while, and I only noticed it now because ""The Matrix"", unlike the brainless action movies surrounding us on all sides, deserves better."
tt0068646,"This movie alongside Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Godfather:part II, The Third Man and Lawrence Of Arabia is my absolutely favorite film. Some scenes you just can't forget. Vito's character is one of the best played roles in movies history (done by Marlon Brando). This story about Corleone family (together with part 2 and 3) is the greatest movie epic ever made."
tt0133093,"I think this movie will be forgotten pretty fast. The first time I saw it, I was stunned by the bullet time and the ""real-ish"" combat. But all in all, it's a very shallow film. Neo is about as interesting a character as a dead fish (not counting Finding Nemo, which probably could have contained a dead fish more interesting than the character Neo), an Morpheus, Smith, Trinity, all of them, Switch and.. oh, did I mention all the characters? They are boring. And the story is very silly. Come on - humans as batteries, programs with families?? Who designed this matrix-thing anyways? It must have been an idiot! The plot barely survives the first time 'round - second time you watch it - it fails.The sad part is that this film is being dragged down in the mud with the two sequels that have been made for the sake of sequels with a combined narrative of about a minute. Worse examples of ""and then""-scripts are only found in Steven Seagal-movies. (except the action which is very amusing - Neo beating up a couple of Smiths with a Smith..)"
tt0102926,"I recently watched the acclaimed movie after hearing many positive comments about it. The storyline was beautifully composed and kept me interested through all of its length. I loved how each character contributed to the overall story line, as well as the way they were portrayed in their own unique moments throughout the movie. There was suspense, action, intrigue, horror, investigation and more. I just learned that there are five movies that follow this story (Hannibal Rising, Manhunter, Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal) and I cannot wait to watch them all. I would highly recommend this movie to be added to everyone's ""must see"" list!"
tt0108052,"This Movie was sensational. It was a piece of art along with being informational. It told people about the holocaust, and it also told people about the human spirit. It shows how people can just triumph over anything with just some help from one person The things that Spielberg did with the movie was incredible too. The black and white was genius, and how he had the little girl in red and the fire was phenuminal. I have never seen anything like it, Schindler's List is beyond all words."
tt7286456,They might have won awards but this is basically the director telling an actor to act crazy and we will film it. It's so fake right down to his stupid laugh. At least when Heath Ledger played Joker he had a storyline and a script that was good to follow. This movie doesn't make any sense and has no real story. They make a movie about how they think a crazy person thinks and acts. HORRIBLE MOVIE!!!
tt0120737,Focus on the fantastic artistic synthesis of concerning hobbits and the founding of the fellowship in a post 9/11 world.Exquisite in every way. Important. And treated with respect and seriousness.There is not one scene in the extended edition that I would remove and that doesn't feel appropriately sandwiched.
tt0848228,"OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!!!!!! I AM SOOOO BLOWN AWAY! THAT MOVIE WAS PERFECT! Sound familiar? Of course it does. Everyone seems to be in love with this movie. I don't know why, though.The action was nearly flawless, I will admit that. It looked very real and must have been among one of the most expensive movies of all time. However, action is not enough to convince me to be in love with a movie. What's number 1 on IMDb.com's top 250 movies of all time list? The Shawshank Redemption. Why is that movie so good? (Sorry if you aren't a huge fan of that movie). It was good because of the story line. The great acting. The great cast. There is not one action scene in that movie. Yet it is so good. I feel as though people like and/or love The Avengers for the opposite reason. The story wasn't exactly BAD or anything but I can't find anything special about it.Right from the very beginning- BOOM! Loki just happens to appear from Lord knows where. I love the idea of assembling a team of Super Powered People (super heroes) to form The Avengers. Great. I just feel like I could have predicted the entire movie. I expected Loki to appear, wreak havoc. The Avengers to assemble, all of them having lots of disagreements. Then in the blink of an eye they would work together and beat Loki in a huge battle. And where will this battle take place? NEW YORK!!!! How original!The acting was good, except I just can't stand Loki, or Tom Hiddleston, or both, I don't even know. I just think he is very annoying and not even close to a good villain. I find myself so unafraid of Loki while guys like The Joker or Bane or Venom scare me to death if I were ever to encounter them in real life (if they were real people).It was just very bland to me, there were some very funny moments and some moments that were very good action scenes. Doesn't mean I give this movie a 10 it doesn't deserve like other people. The fact that it is somewhere along the lines of an 8.2 just disappoints me big time. I would've expected like a 7.5-7.8. I don't think it deserves a spot among the top 250.I do like this movie, you can see I gave it 7 stars. As I said the acting, cast, and action is very good. But that doesn't mean the story line, predictability or the main villain is any good at all.All I can say is I've seen better hero movies."
tt0068646,"I don't understand why this movie is on top of the list, i din't find any thing in this movie to top the list with highest ratings. The cast did very good acting though but story not deserve to be on top of best 250. This is one of those rubbish old mafia films This movies always fence around the gangster family about there revenge story sucks, ridiculously overrated in the end all you found that you wasted 3 good hours of your day, its a goddamn crap its annoying. soooooo boring! whatever the reviews and rating says i hate this crap and I won't recommend any one to see this it will only disappoint you from what you expected from ""The Godfather"" Don Out."
tt0108052,This film to me was just over hyped and so long it just got boring to me
tt0133093,"The Matrix took everybody by surprise back in 1999 but after the initial euphoria there was very little left to say about this movie which is, I believe, way over-rated. True, the special effects had a new look but that's pretty much all there is to it. Now those SFX are clich√© and close to ridiculous. Look at Terminator II, now over twelve years old, the SFX are still ahead of today's standards.The story is basically a cross-over between the Terminator plot (also Blade Runner and a lot more sci-fi movies with the mankind overrun by machine and artificial intelligence idea) and the Dark City setting and ambiance (trench coats, an artificial city). This lack of originality is why, in my humble opinion, the movie's sequels didn't do as well. The acting is OK but far from good and the directing is the same as most 'hollywoodian' movies from the last ten years (IE lacking personal style. Seriously, what's the difference between a Wachowski bros. flick and a Roland Emmerich one?).I've tried to watch it again on several occasions but usually I end up fast forwarding to the main action scene and then turning the movie off and then I get the feeling that that scene resumes the entire movie; a lot of noise about nothing."
tt0167260,"Nothing but plot armor. Even the freaking earth caving from underneath only the orcs was outrageous. Frodo had a dopey grin and did nothing but disappoint and NOT throw the ring in. Samewise was the only redeeming character.
Gandalf didn't use magic ONCE. Very lame.
Also the girl killed the guy on the dragon... I love feminism being thrown in my face.
Doctor who has better effects.
I loved the elephants and the totally-not-cliche African looking people riding them.
Also, elves and orcs aren't even real. Guess I'll play pretend because that's the only way all the main characters got out of that alive.
Good movie though. :)"
tt0120737,"A true masterpiece.I am on a quest to finish all this saga, and understand more about this world.My mom actually is the one responsible for dragging me into this, and I loved that she did so!What a great movie, and to imagine that all the CGI effects, and the unquestionable responsibility towards all the details determines this film as one of best fictional stories ever made.The story itself is also very interesting, and makes me curious about everything in this world.Ps: I watched the extended version, and its the best way to enjoy this experience."
tt1375666,"Went to see this film recently and was very disappointed. I was expecting something amazing given the extremely high IMDb rating - couldn't have been more disappointed with this movie.The special effects were good, but apart from that, I think the film didn't work particularly well and it's totally over-rated.The acting was nothing amazing and the story is not as clever as it pretends to be. I agree with some other reviewers on here, that this film passes itself off as being very intelligent and clever but only for people who don't have any intelligence and are easily pleased.I like Nolan's other work - Dark Knight was excellent, however, this movie is nowhere near as good and felt pretty lame.I think a lot of people who don't even understand this movie, just gave it a high rating assuming it was a clever movie when it actually wasn't that good at all.This movie is certainly 'not' a masterpiece or anything even close. It felt like a Matrix wannabe, but I have to say The Matrix blows this movie out of the water by a huge margin.As I write this review, this movie is currently in the top 3 movies of all time?? I've never been more shocked - get real people. It seems the film companies are paying people to vote on here and boost their films - there can be no other explanation. Very disappointing and was expecting so much more from this movie. Don't bother paying to see it in the cinema as you will feel let down."
tt0422272,"This movie is really bad. The acting is so out of focus. I was bored to tears watching it, and couldn't help but laugh during the ¬´ tense ¬ª moments. That's what you get when a horror movie is trying too hard. Or simply think it can. Poor Calista Flockhart looks goofier than she did on Ally McBeal, and it obviously wasn't supposed to be comedic... I can't honestly suggest it, not even to fans of the actress. Or the genre, because it's done poorly with too many misplaced claims. It is so predictable, you even guess the ¬´ big twist ¬ª before the screen turns black."
tt1375666,"I'd like to keep my review rather to the point.Pros: 1. its theme - dream is a fascinating topic to say the least. There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld.2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns.3. its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next, still you feel jumpy about it when it does.4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it's hard to keep up, even after watching it several times.5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe.6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.Cons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you ask me.2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused.3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I'm afraid, Inception overused this trick.In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement.I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks, if you dig this kind of flicks.Cheers!"
tt0109830,"Conventional wisdom back in 1994 stated that one must either be a huge fan of Oscar nominee Pulp Fiction (which purportedly signified the new cinema) or of its polar opposite, Oscar winner Forrest Gump (which signified old school film). Truthfully, I am a fan of neither film and of the Best Picture nominees for that year, I would most assuredly have picked The Shawshank Redemption over both without hesitation.Forrest Gump is a simple story about a simple man - expanded over an arrogant nearly 3 hour running time. A Southern man of low I.Q., whose good intentions and well-meaning heart allow him to triumph over the obstacles and adversities life throws his way. The film opens with Forrest sitting on a park bench regaling others with his exploits, such as his outrunning bullies and becoming a football hero, his tour in Vietnam which led to a successful shrimping business and his enduring love for his childhood friend, Jenny.Director Robert Zemeckis can be a great director and the first hour of Forrest Gump is very good. It establishes a tone of bemused whimsy that the material requires. Unfortunately, bemused whimsy is a hard tone to maintain, especially when your film has such a slight plot, a running time that would be a strain with the best material, and a central character that is, let's face it, not particularly fascinating. By the midway section, the film starts to stumble and then completely implodes right around the time that Forrest starts running back and forth from coast to coast for no apparent reason.For comedic measure and a degree of relevance, the story tries to shoehorn Forrest in with historic figures, fads and events, some of which work well and some not at all. The tie-in with Watergate and Forrest showing his wound to Nixon are amusing, but his scene on the National Mall at an anti-war protest where the microphone cuts out so the crowd can remain clueless that he is an imbecile is ridiculously coy. And the sequence with John Lennon, where it is obvious the words do not match the lip movements is downright embarrassing. The Oscar for special effects here is a real stretch.Tom Hanks can be a great everyman actor (like James Stewart). He can also be overrated and it is to his misfortune that the two films for which he won back to back Oscars are two of his most overrated efforts. One can see politically in Oscar circles why he would win for Philadelphia, but the win for Forrest Gump the next year is most puzzling. Forrest has very little range emotionally or intellectually, and he largely reacts to everything the same way.Sally Field seems oddly miscast as Forrest's mother, who apparently gifted her son with his low-rent fortune cookie advice. Gary Sinise provides the film's only really great performance as Forrest's Vietnam superior and later friend - providing some of the grit and emotion that the remainder of the film lacks.In the pivotal role of Jenny - the girl who Forrest has loved since childhood - Robin Wright is a complete wash-out. The film keeps returning to her character, who has become an embittered drug addict and it founders every time it does. Jenny may have her reasons for her addictions, but she is often played as a shrewish selfish person, who takes Forrest's help when convenient, and shuns him when she is finished with him. Hanks and Wright have no chemistry together and because of her shoddy treatment of Forrest, I cannot imagine anyone rooting for them as a couple. A foolishly lengthy mid-film sequence with Jenny on a ledge contemplating suicide actually had one witty film-goer in my audience begging her to jump - I concur. Her final moments in the film are especially absurd - as she once again shows up to prey on Forrest's good will - this time announcing that she is dying from some mystery illness which seems to be AIDS although the filmmakers refuse to say and she wants Forrest to care for her son, which she assures him is his (although we as an audience are not really sure given the characters chronic dishonesty). This strange disease seems to have been borrowed from Love Story, as Wright's only major symptom seems to be that she gets more luminous and has better lighting the closer to death she gets.The final hour of the film is near unendurable. The whimsy has been lost and the events surrounding Forrest just seem to get sillier and more pointless. As a character on which to hang a film, Forrest is largely a slow-witted blank. He ends the film almost exactly as he starts it. He has had no great epiphanies or insights or much in way of growth - he has been largely a passive passenger riding the wave of life. The film's meme that good-hearted people will always get what's coming to them is beyond naive and a tad insulting - as there are many good-hearted people who have the opposite happen. Ironically, we never get to see the expressions or reactions of the people Forrest victimizes with his tales, which may be intentional since they may have run screaming from the park bench or just passed out in bored apathy."
tt0114369,"My expectations from this film were nil until I saw 'Directed by David Fincher' appear on screen. that's when my expectations skyrocketed. But did he live up to them? no, sir, I'm afraid not. You see, the minute I saw Gwyneth Paltrow I knew she'd die. Because what else is she doing in a film about two detectives trying to catch a serial killer. And I knew the writers of a David Fincher film would not place a female lead attached to the protagonist just to be his wife. And it didn't look like she was providing any moral support nor cause an epiphany in the male lead which would enable to solve the case. So she had to go. Also because, that's what happens in every single Tamil film on earth. I sorely hoped fincher would do better than that. But what does he do? He goes a step further and kills her while she's pregnant. because what's better than killing the hero's wife? Killing her while she was pregnant and him not even knowing that until after she's dead. Obviously. That's some below the belt stuff man. Not cool, man. In the last few minutes of the film, I was laughing at myself for how seriously I was taking something that would stop if I closed my phone. Well, thank god Fincher grew up and made some breathtaking stuff like Mindhunter, otherwise I would never forgive him."
tt7286456,Heath Ledger occupies the screen for a fraction of the time that Joaquin Phoenix does but is by far the finest villain in at least Batman but I'd say one of the best performances ever. I just don't get why laughing hysterically and randomly at anything requires an Oscar. Batman is and loved by people without having to tell the story of the joker.
tt0313792,"Jerry Falk (Jason Biggs) is an aspiring writer in New York City. David Dobel (Woody Allen) is his mentor and fellow writer. Life with his girlfriend Amanda Chase (Christina Ricci) is running into rough patches. She has issues and her mother Paula Chase (Stockard Channing) is moving in. His agent Harvey Wexler (Danny DeVito) is hopeless. In flashback, he's living with girlfriend Brooke (KaDee Strickland) when he runs into Bob (Jimmy Fallon) who is dating Amanda.Christina Ricci starts wacky and has some fun. Woody is not funny and is kind of annoying. The flashback drains the movie of early momentum. The psychiatrist bit bored me to tears. Stockard Channing turns into the wacky character of the apartment and the couple loses any humor. The movie just couldn't survive all its' problems."
tt0120737,"Biggest disappointment of the year! It started alright, nice scenery shots and a bunch of happy little creatures. But the moment you get used to the surroundings and creatures, you start to notice that it is one simple and utterly predictable story in which the good prevails over everything! The apotheosis is that after three hours of boredom there is now ending!"
tt1853728,"Waltz and Jackson were great. The story should have ended shortly after Dr. Shultz loses in a cheap buy for Django's wife. Good story to that point, but from there it turns to fantasy.Ten lines needed to complete--okay. At the end Django hides behind a body and shoots who knows how many rifle and pistol shooters. These shooters can only hit the body he is hiding behind. These are shooters who are used to firearms, but they can't hit the Django--what B.S. After the Candie episode, It should have been cut short without all the fantasy at the end. I thought Shultz should have shook hands and ended the film shortly thereafter. I guess I got hyped into going to a theater to see this movie as I expected more from Tarantino in his editing abilities."
tt0108052,"I really don't understand the over the top praise for this film. The lockdown has meant I've had the time to watch longer films, and this is one I wanted to be able to sit down and fully concentrate on.So, lights off and here we go. Three hours fifteen minutes later, was that it? This is what people have raved about?Competent all round yes, but a work of genius? No.I've seen it once and will never feel the need to revisit it."
tt1130884,"I purposely did not read the book prior to seeing this movie because I didn't want to know the plot or be disappointed by the film version. Well I should have saved my money and just read the book. I had the plot figured out less than a third of the way into the movie.I love suspenseful movies but this movie offered very little suspense. Any 'suspenseful' scenes were predictable.Some of the film techniques were good. Like the contrast of the shades of gray during many scenes. However, many of the film techniques were very poor. It was very obvious which scenes were filmed in front of a green screen with the background added later. That's ridiculous with today's technology.Save your money and just read the book."
tt0167261,Great movie I really enjoyed watching and better than the first part
tt0172495,"Was really just a disappointment overall.  What was even more of a disappointment was the fact that it won the academy award for best picture! Was the academy high on crack that year?  Aside from two spectacular battle scenes, everything else was reminiscent of braveheart, which was significantly better then this.  This film's plot was mediocre at best and was a true disappointment."
tt0372784,"The name of David Goyer among the writing credits made me fear the worse. After all those Zig Zag and Blades appallingness you can hardly blame me. So, you may imagine my surprise to discover that Batman Begins is not only better than the previous Batmans but much better. The genesis of the character as well as inedited insights into the seven mystery years in the life of Bruce Wayne makes the whole enterprise engaging even thrilling. Christian Bale is an American Psycho Batman, pouty lips and unexpected sexual presence. Katie Holmes is lovely, with a sharp intelligence and a riveting imperfect beauty. Michael Caine fills the shoes of the butler with wit and charm. Gary Oldman, looking more Oldman than Gary, adds another surprising characterization to his already impressive gallery. So, very nice. There is still hope in hopeless trends. Who knew."
tt1853728,"Many of us have grown up with Tarantino and in this film as others we can see he does some things well but in other areas he has not made any progress.He is excellent at creating scenes of tension, in setting up a story where we see the main players with their conflicting interests and a genuine sense of tension. He did it back in Reservoir Dogs with an undercover cop, in Inglourious Basterds with a Jew-sheltering farmer and performs the same feat again in Django Unchained. What we have right up until the big reveal is a very good movie with a varied cast of individuals each with their own motivations. Lovely. But then it looks like Tarantino cannot get out of the knot he has tied himself. Maybe because he works alone he doesn't have the option of going to other scriptwriters to help him, and maybe there is no-one in the Tarantino camp who can be honest enough with him to tell him when it's not good enough, but right at the moment that Christoph Waltz shoots Leonardo Di Caprio the whole film falls apart.It is almost as if Tarantino is saying ""I can't think of a way out of this, I can't be bothered to work at an answer so here is an implausible gore-fest shootout to close the film.""The first half of the film is an 8, the second half is a 4. Quentin you need to get some people around you who are not in awe of you to the extent they can't tell you when bad is bad."
tt0110912,"It's not a film it's a experience. The characters are very memorable The story of nonlinear dialogue and action no the whole movie is fast and fun there's no down time or anything boring the movie is long. There's more then 10 memorable scenes that is referenced in any type of media. I like to think of pulp fiction as resvoir dogs another film by the genius tarrintino as a better version of it. I thought resvoir dogs had the coffe scene at the start and mr white hurting the police officer. I thought the movie was stretched out more then it needed to and the ending gave me such a poor taste in my mouth. I still like it, like I would get a poster or t shirt of resvoir dogs to show my opinion. There did you see that I lost focus that's what pulp fiction does it makes you forget about the world but remember about the experience. The scene where butch reclaims himself in the eyes of walleces is a redemption story in itself about how we can all get together without fighting and being greedy. The part where 2 scenes ( tiny bit of a spoiler but watch Pulp fiction now if you haven't) where somehow at point blank range a revolver didn't shoot Jules and vincent and somehow Vincent shoots one of the guys in the head on accident. Thats a message life is like a box of chocolates the things you never expect will happen. Another part of the idea is the violence and sex violence plays a big part in this movie these are horrible people that everyone loves when I see this film I feel like it's a LEGO set controlled by tarrintino everything goes together like cause and effect yet while still being random sex is not that big in the film expect for the epic scene where butch remdeems himself and when butch is making out with his girlfriend but that scene was still great because he had to find his watch holy crap. This movie has dialogue lots of it and that's fantastic he is known for dialogue the tarrintino himself said that dialogue is a major component in his films and it shows, other films have such poopy dialogue where all they do is talk about nothing like get on with it. Pulp fiction is the story of 3 as 1 and should be hands down the number 1 film of the millennium ."
tt0372784,"The concept here was great-the execution, not so much. It had been ~15 years since I'd seen this movie so it was essentially a first watch for me.I'll start with the good:
The origin story in and of itself is compelling and builds a strong foundation from the very start. I love having context for how exactly Bruce Wayne becomes Batman.The storyline flows quite naturally and builds upon itself, avoiding any drastic leaps or plot holes.The character arc of Bruce Wayne is enjoyable to watch and you feel satisfied as he faces his past and conquers his fears. I also think Christian Bale fits the mold of the Bruce Wayne character they were going for here.Unfortunately, I thought the production quality and direction of the film detracted from the conceptual value.The bad:
Portrayal of Bruce's early years is well-written but the acting is quite poor and the setting doesn't age consistently with Bruce's growing from adolescence to adulthood (this is admittedly pretty nit-picky). The sequences during Bruce's stint in Bhutan and the League of Shadows are corny and shallow, and I have no idea why Liam Neeson was chosen for the role of Ra's al Ghul-just seemed so out of place to me. In fact, there really wasn't a single acting job that stood out as above average in this movie. A few were good, but most were mediocre at best.I didn't find the villains to be effective at all either-Cilian Murphy wearing a knapsack mask and spraying gas into peoples faces? Not my cup of tea.Finally, there were numerous scenes where the dialogue just didn't come across very well, and I think the writing was to blame rather than the actual delivery. Would've expected a little higher quality from Christopher Nolan.Overall, a good origin story that was hampered by poor execution."
tt0372784,"And so the story begins. Well, according to 'Batman Begins' anyway. This is a very long film, but if offers a detailed account of Bruce Wayne's life, and for the first time in the franchise we really get to know the character. We know where he comes from, what motivates him, and understand why he becomes Batman. Bruce becoming Batman is shown in detail, and I enjoyed that.Despite being fantasy, the clever storytelling makes it feel realistic. I liked the idea that Bruce failed on numerous accounts. This showed that - behind the mask and cape - he was still just human, and not an actual superhero with powers. He is vulnerable, he hurts, he falls, and picks himself up again. None of the other Batman films so effectively illustrated the character as a human being. Bruce overcoming his fear is also well done.'Batman Begins' is visually stunning, with a great production design, and incredible action sequences. As with all the other Batman movies, there are more than one antagonist. The first antagonist is crime lord Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). He is then dethroned by antagonist Crane (Cillian Murphy), who - in my opinion - is the film's main antagonist. Then we also have Ducard (Liam Neeson), and even Earle (Rutger Hauer) turns out to be a villain. Too many antagonists for one film? Surprisingly, here, it works well.Batman must stop Crane, who dumps toxins into Gotham City's water supply, and Ducard, who wants to destroy Gotham City. The result is an action-packed thriller that delivers! The film also features a great score by Hans Zimmer."
tt0111161,"The good points of this movie have already been stated in the other posts, so I will stick to the points I feel detracted from the movie. This movie never gripped me, I never really felt all that emotionally involved with the characters.  Even though 19 years passed in the story, I never got the sense of time passing as I have in other movies that have storylines that span decades.  All the characters who weren't prisoners were very one-dimensional.  Overall, it was a pretty good movie, but I don't think it belongs in the top 250."
tt0468569,"Yes, the special effects were amazing. In some ways it's the modern day's Star Trek: The Motion Picture.The plot was predictable,boring, and extremely long. I saw it in theatres and had to force myself to stay to the end. Yes, Heath Ledger was good. A playful psycho. But the film itself is something I'd have to be tied down to see again.So much of the accolades this film had seems based on Heath Ledger's death. It would be interesting to know how the reviews would be if not for that tragedy.I suspect the next generation would look back on this film and say ""boring""."
tt0167260,"I am less enamored with this one then I was with the previous two films (particularly Two Towers, which is my favorite), though I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and say that had I seen this film on it's own without the previous prequels, I may have given it a higher rating.No doubt about it, these films are revolutionary and the pinnacle of fantasy film making, but I just found this one a little tiring. You more or less generally know how it's going to turn out anyway (good guys will get their butts kicked a few times, but will prevail after many long, tedious battles later), so I guess I can't blame the film for delivering exactly what I expected in a final chapter, but I guess I found the journey to get there (first two movies) far more interesting than the end result. After a while, all the eye candy of CGI-created battles gets a bit tiring to look at.So I'll give it a 10 for craftsmanship and artistry, but a 7 for holding my interest."
tt0167261,"I must admit that I did enjoy the first film and although it perhaps was a little slow in setting up the story it still remains a fairly compelling watch overall. Sadly I didn't get that same feeling when watching this second instalment for the following reasons...Firstly, splitting all of the characters up and trying to show the story from various different perspectives is a risky strategy. If it's done wrong then it can make the film feel unfocused and not particularly interesting and sadly this second instalment falls into this very trap.The film flits about from character to character, story arc to story arc without giving any particular character or story arc chance to develop or grow properly. It doesn't help that sometimes there can be long gaps from one story arc to another meaning that you may have forgotten what was going on in the previous story arc? I got the feeling that Jackson was trying to weave the stories together, but it seems that this isn't one of his strengths.The second thing that bothered me slightly about this film was the character of Gollum - for some reason I felt that we were being teased in the first film that he was an interesting character that's shrouded in mystery. Whilst his character is fun for a bit, his repetitive rantings and antics do start to grate after a while.I was also disappointed that Gandalf and Saruman weren't given much screen time here - the former seemed to just drift in and out of the story and the latter was only really featured towards the end. Although their absences were perhaps necessary to the story I found them to be the most compelling characters and was a bit annoyed that they both weren't in the film more often.The final battle sequences are nicely staged and once again the performances from the principal cast were excellent - Bernard Hill's superb performance helped the film greatly when McKellen and Lee weren't on screen. John Rhys Davies also provided some excellent comic relief which again helped to improve my overall opinion of this film.The Two Towers is still a worthy film that's relatively enjoyable, but I just felt that by splitting the characters up and in establishing separate story arcs that it felt a little disjointed and lacked the smooth and more simplistic flowing of the story in the first film."
tt0120737,"I don't understand how anyone who has read the book can like this film. Acting is awful and the film is full of pointless sadistic violence. It is insane that this film is shown to really young kids. This is not a Tolkien movie, it is a TERMINATOR movie without Arnold. And the body count is bigger. It is plain to see that everything is made with calculator to maximize the profit. Violence sells. Most of the Tolkien magic from the book is gone. All that is left is an empty shell that is used to stage a massacre. It is sad to see that this kind of rubbish is enough for so many people. Of course if you are used to see only this kind of stuff you are not expecting any better. Tolkien must be rolling in his grave."
tt0068646,"The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for ""gangster movies"", but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every ""organized crime film"" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply ""influential"" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as ""a movie about gangsters"". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his ""innocence"" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an expos√© of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends."
tt1345836,"Christopher Nolan has finished up the Batman series in remarkable style. Where Batman Begins was about conquering fears and the Dark Knight was about traversing the fine line between order and madness; the Dark Knight Rises seems to be a movie about compromise and acceptance.It has been eight years since the death of Harvey Dent and Gotham has settled down into some semblance of peace. The main instigators of this crime-free age, however, have many scars for their trouble. Bruce Wayne ( Christian Bale ) is a reclusive cripple- with shot knees and scar tissue riddling his body. Commissioner Gordon ( Gary Oldman ) has found his career is now burdened by the lie that he and Batman wove to keep Harvey Dent's reputation spotless- so much so that he is separated from his family. Alfred ( Michael Caine ) despairs about Bruce Wayne's welfare- fearing that his master wants little more than a grand death. And Lucius Fox ( Morgan Freeman ) is attempting to stave Wayne Enterprises from bankruptcy thanks to all the money that Wayne has invested into Miranda Tate's ( newcomer Marion Cotillard ) renewable energy source.However a new threat emerges in the guise of Bane ( Tom Hardy )- a massive masked mercenary who has a connection to Batman's past. He claims to want a new Gotham where the 'have-nots' can rule over the 'haves' and bring true justice to the rich and corrupt. Alongside him is Selina Kyle ( Anne Hathaway ) a cat burglar who motives are enigmatic at best. It is therefore up to the old guard as well as idealistic cop John Blake ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) to try and hold Gotham together.Nolan has gone for bigger is better in his third movie of the trilogy and it certainly comes off as an sweeping, epic movie. Christian Bale probably gives his best performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman and the scenes he has with Caine's Alfred are particularly moving. Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are both very good also- with the scenes between Oldman and Gordon-Levitt ( probably the best of the newcomers ) nice to watch.But as good as the film is...it doesn't really seem to cover much more new ground. This isn't really helped by their choice of villain. Hardy does a good job as Bane, but he isn't helped by his breathing mask which makes him, at times, hard to understand. Furthermore, while Bane is shown to be dangerous, Nolan seems to be forcing the viewer to show how dangerous he is. Without the personal and affable menace of Neeson's Ra's Al Ghul or the twisted and frightening charisma of Ledger's Joker, Bane's most menacing moments come before the real action kicks off. Furthermore, it's difficult to see why anyone would want to follow him- utopia or not.As for Catwoman, Hathaway is very good in the role, but her character seems to be frustrating at times- seeming to just sit on the fence for the heck of it. Cotilliard's Miranda Tate is a fairly bland character that doesn't add much to the proceedings either.Furthermore, while the movie is indeed epic in scope, it sometimes gets lost in its own arcs in a way that the Dark Knight never did. The twists and turns that would have been seen as remarkable in the Dark Knight in this movie came across as almost unnecessary.Begins was a tight film that revolved around a single plot arc and holds together well. The Dark Knight was the true noir epic- a sweeping tale about morality and order in a insane city. The Dark Knight Rises is a flawed masterpiece- it's achievements not quite living up to the ambitions that it perhaps had. However, any Batman movie directed by Christopher Nolan is probably a good one. This is no exception."
tt0480025,I decided to give this movie a watch last night after hearing nothing but positive reviews off this site and once again it shows the reviews cant be trusted this movie is terrible. The acting is OK but the story makes absolutely no sense. Its about a group of skinheads...yes skinheads who are apparently poser skinheads I don't know? They are nice non racists who don't believe in any of the skinhead ideaology. So my guess is these guys just think they are cool and dress up as skinheads...get this one of the skinheads is black....This movie is so stupid and unrealistic...The acting was OK but thats about it. The writing was terrible the main kid was terrible and hard on the eyes. This movie had about one good part and for a skinhead movie I thought it would have a bunch. Seriously if you know anything about skinheads don't watch this movie...
tt0114369,"Se7en is one of my favorite movies. I guess that says a lot about me. I can't pass it by when flicking through my cable guide. Every time I watch it I see or hear something new. Morgan Freeman is superb as a tired and emotionally beaten down cop getting ready to retire. Brad Pitt is very convincing as a young new detective running his first serial killer investigation with all the nerves and ambitious recklessness you'd expect from having to partner with a veteran on his last case before retirement. The duo face a witty killer who kills based on the seven deadly sins. The real stars of this movie are the writer, director and set designers for presenting incredibly intricate and graphic murder scenes and making all the characters likable. The writing is deep and you have to pay attention to every detail. As the bodies mount you find yourself counting down each deadly sin to the incredible climax and shocking but truly awesome ending. You can't go wrong with the cast assembled in Se7en. It's a great movie for whodunit fans that like a little more tension and voyeurism in their crime dramas. It will not disappoint."
tt1853728,Tarantino is unpredictable. You never know what to expect in the next scene. And that's make the movie interesting. The music is also excellent. Only this blood is too much for me. So I give 8.

Nostalgia. Researching brings you to your best memories as boy. Craving for heroism with the ultimate man: Maximus Decimus Meridius, Russel crowe and the Spaniard. Over the top, but that is what you need in this type of movie for a boy of 12. That woman though. Just to much...."
tt0102926,"This movie is just a mess from beginning to end. First of all, actors and actresses have a tendency to overact, so writers and directors will always try to throw realism out the window so that they can indulge themselves! While the character of Dr. Lecter is not technically impossible, it is highly unlikely. Sociopaths in real life are much more likely to be low functioning, impulsive, and not very good book learners. So this movie starts off with a bad premise. I'm not a very big fan of Jodie Foster movies to begin with, and her character is very annoying to me. The best part of the entire film is the Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) scenes. The idea that Lecter would give Starling such highly intellectualized clues is improbable, but I suppose I am being overly critical here. This is still less annoying than Manhunter, but not by much!!"
tt0133093,"I hated The Matrix. Saw it when it first came out, in a multiplex where I also saw The Corrupter with Chow Yun-fat, which I loved. Two different eras and styles of movie making. The new and the old. Special effects and thematic BS vs a real story with believable characters.I know, I know, I'm old-fashioned. So be it. When Keanu Reeves is dodging bullets in hyper-space and goofy-time, I felt like dodging out the door. I always tell my friends that when people in the movie start flying through the air, I start flying out the door.I have a friend I love dearly who started a discussion group about whether we all live in a matrix, whether the life we think we know is all fake. Oh, Lordy, what a colossal waste of time. To me. Not to her and not to modern audiences.Oh, well, time marches on. Onward into the matrix, friends and neighbors. Think I'll stay right here, in good old-fashioned reality, whatever that is."

Not only did it fail miserably in development of character and storyline, it was a mistake to have Gimley being a joking dwarf? Who wants to hear one line jokes every other 10 mins. And WTF with Gollum being half of a jar jar binks? Gollum Binks is not what I was looking for? The score was almost unbearable and compared to the first score I can't believe that this one was so Muted and desperate in searching for the right moment. I just got home from the engagement of the 11:59 Pm show on 12-17-02. My friend and I are Ring Die hards and decided to get a first look at the much anticipated sequel.... We are both in a state of shock over how it never got into the flow of any thing near what the Fellowship had accomplished. I was saying I know at the Opening Premiere for the cast at the end they all went....""UH OH"" inside there heads. And then proceeded to try and trick themselves into believing it was a work of art. Horrible follow up and one of the biggest all time single failures in sequels. You will see what I'am saying when you see it.It was better than most movies out but for the fact that Jackson and crew did such an astonishing job on the first I thought since they filmed them all together he was on to something with a special vibe he had created with this mystical bond? Nope........... Big Let Down......."

tt0361748,"Well what can i say... When i went to watch this movie in the cinema i was excited. The start is great.But then the peace slows down and the movie turns into boring and frustrating hybrid. Yes there are good scenes which are even funny (well considered the brutality,not always ). But then again there are very few and very rare moments which deserve higher rating. This movie is a hit & miss. Some people will comment positive just because they like Tarantino. But for others who seek a good movie,this just isn't it!I don't really like the way the movie tries to tell you a story which just isn't there.The plot is plain and very few actors took it seriously it seems.The movie isn't the worst but nothing special and for me it was just a waste of time...4/10"
tt0167260,"After finishing my 100th (give or take) time watching the entire trilogy I'd figured a review was long overdue. There are no words for what i feel about this trilogy. It's beyond anything i can explain. The closest word would be perfection, but that doesn't even do it justice.I was 11 when the first movie came out, and i fell in love with the franchise immediately. Everything i did revolved around the fantasy universe as this franchise was the first big thing i truly fell in love with. I have pictures of elves on my walls and dragon statues on my shelfs. I have Sting hanging on my wall and my key chain for my car keys is the One Ring. My wife has the evening star and she wore it at our wedding. Lord of the rings has made me to who i am today and i feel privileged to have such a masterpiece be created in my short span on this earth!I love Fellowship of the Ring and Two Towers, but Return of the King is the final piece that brings everything together. I'm usually a pretty tough guy, and i rarely get emotional but the last hour is hard for me to sit through without shedding a tear. No matter how many times i watch the franchise i always get emotional. ""My friends. You bow to no one!"" gets me every time!The last thing I'd like to ad is that i feel like I'm a part of the journey. I feel sorta empty after watching it. I feel like all of the hobbits when they come back home and drinks their first pints at The Green Dragon. It's one of the movies where i sit through the end credits and just think. This is a good thing. You know a movie is extraordinary if it makes you empty after you've watched it!"
tt1130884,"***********************SPOILERS++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ The movie starts off seeming to be a ""creepy"" thriller about the escape of an insane killer from an island fortress, somewhere off the shores of Boston. It's standard stuff for the first 45 minutes or so, with the usual attempt to make the criminally insane look scary. Mood is everything here, but as the movies have been down this path so many times, and as-in my case-I know that the insane are not particularly scary, it's a question of wondering why Scorsese is going down this trite path.When he shifts the plot to a ""conspiracy"" plot it gets even triter. And then it shifts ponderously to a ""fooled you"" ending. The story tries to confuse with it's shifts, but underneath it all it's all sturm and very little drang. When the ultimate plot line is revealed it's a big let down. It's ""spellbound"" rehashed.The big problems for me were that it continues to trot out the usual myths about mental illness; it's symptoms, it's causes, and it's cures."
tt0167260,"All the threads of Tolkien's magnum opus come together in the most elegant of fashions in the final part of Peter Jackson's adaptation. Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.""Return of the King"" is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.The cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien's creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect.Now that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for.A masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own. Well deserving of all the high praise thrown at it, and then some..."
tt0287336,"""The Big Heist"" is a small time flick about a small time mob boss (Sutherland) and his crew.  Whether this tv film for A&E was based on a true story is irrelevant. It isn't gonna get any better than a low budget schlock flick either way. This marginally interesting story, which can't be taken seriously, wanders between comedy and drama as it fiddles around with boring details then sprints to its anticlimactic conclusion before running out of gas. Mediocre fodder for sofa spuds into mob stories. (C)"
tt0468569,"There's a villain, full of colour, takes to the stage, a double crossing trickster seeks to enrage, a Mafioso kind of broker, it's the one and only Joker, hands of torment, turmoil, torture's what he'll rage. A triumvirate of Gotham forms a cordon, The Batman, Harvey Dent, Lieutenant Gordon, but they're seduced by the performance, limited by laws conformance, the playmaker relishing, all the destruction. It's not too long before their weaknesses are found, as hostages are taken to compound, ultimatums are presented, prominent profiles are demented, and our hero runs for cover, goes underground."
tt1345836,"The Dark Knight Rises. The most anticipated film of the decade so far, and the finisher to an epic trilogy. Only perfection will do, it seems.Unfortunately, perfection is something that has arguably never been achieved in film, so asking that of Nolan may be a bit much. What should be asked of Nolan, however, is cohesion. And it is this which drags the film from an intelligent and deep thriller down to an average summer blockbuster.The lack of cohesion manifests itself in each element of the film, as sporadic directing hampers an ambitious story. When dealing with a story of this scale, intimacy is the key balance that must be applied; but intimacy is hard to find. We are given stacks of characters with their own branching stories, but none of them feel particularly fulfilled. Bane's history is lightly explored, and a dire lack of information is regards to Selina Kyle brings down what is otherwise a respectable performance from Anne Hathaway.Our titular hero is also handled bizarrely, being followed religiously by the story at the beginning of the film, only to be lost in a sea of scenarios by the second half.The reason the Dark Knight was so compelling was that it was focused - The Joker and Batman were polar opposites, and flowed seamlessly along the story line. But with Rises, the lines are blurred; as characters swap sides and back-stab with seemingly no reason or motive. Such flippant and fickle disregard can only be tolerated by the audience for so long.Overall, the film is a mixed bag of jarring ideas and contrived messages; but when stripped to it's core, it's an exciting and menacing spectacle. It's just a shame that its predecessor's integrity wasn't kept intact."
tt0114369,"Se7en was an interesting concept, i loved the idea. Too bad David Fincher occasionally leaves out a little thing called logic. Too many plot holes, unanswered questions and preposterous character choices all around.

tt0422272,"Wow as I got this in a triple pack box-set I was not expecting such a great horror flick, now what usually makes me scared are the shock horror jumpy moments, this really didn't have many yet I was still shocked and quite scared by the appearance of Charlotte in the end. The ""mechanical girl"" phrase was used to good use to lay out the plot, I especially liked it because its what a young girl or boy would call her and it really plays tricks on your mind. The acting was brilliant , and it holds onto one of the greatest plots in modern horror, think a remake should be made , and i think it should be made into one of the extreme horrors of nowadays , well one of the horror films were it really pushes the boundaries. Now that would be an amazing film.Its an amazing film and will certainly scare you a lot , this film doesn't need cheap scares or jumps , its a whole new world."
tt0108052,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."
tt1130884,"Shutter Island. The story starts you off with a strong suspense of something really wrong in the so called island. It then develops a very subtle intrigue to the story, which keeps us assuming and guessing repeatedly on what the actual truth is. When the story progresses, just when you've received the pieces of the puzzle to actually delve the story, you then realize that you've been working on the right pieces, but in the wrong puzzle.The acting was very good and well coordinated. You could feel the dramatization of the characters and subtle elements that will keep your mind moving. They also arranged the sound well, with a simple yet chilling heavy bass orchestra to psyche up the moment, and at the same time complete silence to pique in your senses. I was a bit disappointed with some parts of the editing, but these small bricks didn't affect any major enjoyment of the movie.This movie should be watched with great attention to detail, to give yourself a satisfying outcome once all the mysteries unwind itself, leaving you with a repeating portrait of the story in your mind."
tt0372784,"I really wanted to like this film.I didn't.Here's why: The first thirty-forty minutes of the film: totally useless. We've already seen Batman's origins in the first film, albeit a coincidental double-murder at the beginning of the film, and we've seen all this martial-arts rigmarole in Kill Bill and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. You can take away the entire first segment of the film, and nothing is lost.The film doesn't really start until Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham. At this point, I was thrilled that the movie had moved along. The thrill was short-lived.I found the mobster angle to be interesting: Bruce Wayne/Batman was in a corruptible network that had become incorruptible by virtue (or vice) of its own corruption. Fine.Batman catches the Kingpin of one gang, and all of the sudden, everything is better.Hokum.If that had actually happened, there would be a mob war that Batman would find almost impossible to handle by himself.Then, there is the obligatory being-chased-by-the-cops angle. (Oooh, is he good or bad? I just don't know!!!) In the third act, Bruce Wayne/Batman is chased down by the ghosts (?) of the ""Legion Of Shadows"" and they are threatening to destroy Gotham via the poisoning of the water system.First of all, martial arts have nothing to do with the Batman myth, unless we are just talking about one of the graphic novels. Even so, it doesn't advance the plot at all: In fact, it delays the plot by about thirty-forty minutes.Secondly, one Mafia kingpin going down does not mean that all crime in Gotham ends. Yes, I know his underling (please, this sleaze is the second-in-command?) is still running free, but there would be plenty of other mob families waiting to take control.Finally, these non-entities from the beginning of the film show up again, and terrorize the city with poison in the water? Why was this film made? To make money, obviously. I certainly coughed up my five-and-a-half bucks.I guess my main problem with the film is the intent of the film, which the director has made clear is to make a ""serious"" Batman film.You know what? When Tim Burton made his first Batman film, he was accused of the same thing.The mistake that Christopher Nolan has made is that he has made a Batman film that is serious, but he forgot to make it fun.He certainly wants to eat his cake and have it too, by trying to throw in ""funny"" one-liners, but by the time we get to them, their time has woefully passed.At least three times during this film, I couldn't wait for it to be over. I haven't felt that way about any Batman film so far, even the inept Batman Returns."
tt0468569,"Okay, I hate to have to do this but....this movie really was not that good. First: Ledger was good, a few times I felt he was unsure of his performance but other then that he was everything the Joker should be, dark, witty and sickly humorous. He is the only thing that makes this film worth watching. Every time he was on the screen I wanted more of him and every-time he left I lamented and got bored with pop corn action stupid high budget film affects...far from what traditional film making tenders to. Too bad the old method acting left him sleep deprived and well, no longer alive. If there is one film for him to end his career with it is certainly this. Second: Maggie Gylenhal is not hot, Wayne should have gone after the three girls he pulled up with in his copter, wow. Third: The thugs in this movie sucked, i was not scared of them what so ever, really all their performance did was make me laugh. Fourth: THERE WAS NO BAT CAVE....enough said. Fifth: There were too many stories going on at once, never did they fully develop into what I hoped they would have...Somewhat similar to The Prestige NOlAN. Sixth: Harvey Dent was okay, however when he turned into 2-face he just looked flat out stupid...and to me funny. Don't GET ME WRONG HERE. I HAVE BEEN RAVING ABOUT THIS MOVIE, SAW IT LAST NIGHT AND WELL GOD....IT DID NOTHING FOR ME. I base a films worth on how it makes me feel, in the end, I felt annoyed the Joker was not more of the center piece to this film. EVERYTHING WAS PREDICTABLE....I guess I should expect this with a postmodern popcorn flick ( all too centered around spectacle) concerned only with instant gratification and no digging to figure out latent meanings. Sure...in the end Batman will stay in the shadows, thats all the ending tells us. Didn't WE ALWAYS KNOW THIS????? I really cant go on...Batman Begins was a much better film. All you people had it so strongly in your head that this film was destined to be great that no matter what the end result was, your head tells you it was that very thing...great...when really it was a clich√© action flick highlighted by Mr. Ledger himself. They should have called this film ""The Joker"" or of course, ""Why so serious?"". And of course like I said, focused more on what is one of the most original performances of the year in Ledgers. Nough said, pop corn lovers."
tt0137523,"!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS !!!!!The premise of a lonely aimless soul attending cancer therapy groups and AA meetings might have been savagely funny if done right but here it`s badly executed as the first 20 minutes is taken up with Ed Norton droning on in an over literary voice over . I know a cinematic masterwork like APOCALYPSE NOW used voice over but so did THE DUKES OF HAZZARD so it`s just as likely to be the work of a buffoon than a genius . The themes of male grief , alienation and the back lash against 80s consumerism are just as badly developedFIGHT CLUB is good in parts like the scene where the members cover a car park with bird seed so that the pigeons s*hit all over the new cars , but the film is unworthy of the praise lavished upon it by large sections of IMDB voters . I can imagine 17 year old males loving this film - I`d be shocked if they didn`t - but for anyone else who`s old enough to have more mature and critical views should be able to recognise this as one extremely overlong overrated one trick pony . As for the metaphysical twist ending it just doesn`t make sense and brings the whole proceedings down . The narrator was beating himself up was he ? Yeah right .If FIGHT CLUB is the masterpiece  it`s supposed to be then how come it was virtually ignored at the Oscars in one of the weakest years for films in a long time ?"
tt0110912,"While watching, I was about half into the movie, I thought: Ok, now I get why everyone loves this movie so much. It's funny and the situations are so absurdly entertaining. I kept thinking: Damn, I am so excited for that ending, which brings everything together and makes sense of it all.But it doesn't come. We just get a timejump to inbetween the story, showing us how to get away with murder and that continues the robbery from the start, this time with full context. But to what result? None. It has no influence on the movie whatsoever. And it wasn't the most interesting scene aswell.
One could argue that, had it not been for that ""miracle"" moment that we see in the flashback, and Jackson's characters decision to retire from the job, they would've both been in the boxers appartment, which means that the boxer would've died, and many of the other stuff would not have happened. And that IS pretty genius and really cool.Then again, there is stuff that was cool to watch, but that had really no influence on the movie as far as I can see. The whole sequence with Travolta and Thurman for example. It was fun to watch, because of Tarantinos awesome style for dialogue and stuff, but it didn't really add to the overall story.One could argue, that this movie is plotless, but I wouldn't go that far.It is very original and genius in some aspects, in others not as much as I would've liked.Cheers"
tt0468569,"Batman. Pause and think about that character for a minute.
""The Batman"" is a guy in a spandex bat suit going around fighting crime, a superhero character from a comic book from the 1940's for young children looking for a bit of fun and a place for their juvenile imaginations to run free. His sworn enemy is ""the Joker"", a clown with clown tricks up his sleeve who's a villain.Where the earlier Tim Burton adaptations were fun and tongue in cheek, this here takes the Batman, the guy running around in spandex in a bat suit fighting off the bad guys... and makes an attempt at a disconcertingly, utterly serious film noir with an atmosphere about as dense as a horror movie, exceeding the 2hr30 mark. It's... like a joke, it's something akin to the concept for a comedy sketch one would have. To take something a bit ridiculous and light, and reverse its momentum in making it into this piece that takes itself completely, utterly seriously. It's a very common premise for many comedy sketches or concepts.The fact it was received so absurdly well by the greater public is, sadly, testament to how empty and strayed our current times are, that the common individual looks for a hero and ideals of greatness, epic drama, and meaning, in something like a 3 hour long horror movie/thriller version of Batman directed by Christopher Nolan. And this review doesn't even take into account the film from a technical perspective: too many characters, cringy silly scenes, way too long... etc"
tt0137523,"David Fincher is someone I have come across recently. I have been delving deeper into studying directors and their films and David Fincher is on that list of mine.Fincher does a great job of using black fill and a low key lighting shot to complement the theme of ""Fight Club"".And along with the great cinematography is a great cast that put a ton of effort into making this movie be felt by the viewer.Unique, interesting, and funny are my words to use here."
tt0172495,"The fight scenes are good, but thats about it. Story is good in theory but the movie is drawn out I had a hard time watching the whole thing. I wish I could describe why I don't like it better, but all I can say is thats ITS SO BORING. I watch a ton of movies, I love movies. And because of this I hate seeing all the reviews that say this is one of the best movies ever."
tt0167260,"Before I review this good movie, I have to get something that's been bothering me off my chest.I went with eight people to see ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King."" All eight of them found it ""good"" at best. We all thought it was too long, with too many passages of dialogue explaining what was going to happen (""I ride to Minis Tirith at dawn to face the enemies of Middle-Earth!"" -- just do it already!), too many scenes that most definitely could have been cut or edited, and we all found that the ending of the film stretched on too long and we didn't need to see Frodo and Sam fondly gazing at each other ninety times before we got the idea that they have an affection for each other. (Brotherly love or...something else?)The thing is, all the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies are good. But none of them are great. Filmed by Peter Jackson with an epic feeling that betrays J.R.R. Tolkien's light-hearted tale, the films try to take a somewhat light idea and turn them into epics -- a problem, since the entire world is fantasy, and it is hard to take anything in the film dreadfully serious. (I thought it was just I, but some other critics have noted the same problem.)This is the best ""Lord of the Rings"" movie. Even though it sounds as if I am complaining about them, I am not. I'm complaining about the way movie geeks flock to the cinemas and spread word that it's the ""best film of all time,"" then post these comments on the Internet and try to boost the film's rating on IMDb. (Some fans have been caught in the act of making multiple usernames to do so.)I find it almost laughable that anyone could argue that the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is the best of all time, or that it is the better than ""The Godfather"" (because that film stands as the number one film on the Internet Movie Database, there are heated debates from ""Rings"" fans claiming that ""The Godfather"" is trash and their favorite film is not).It's all opinion, of course, but I sometimes wonder whether the fans of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" those who claim they are superior to ""The Godfather,"" have even seen that film. I also wonder whether the strict fans that claim it is the best film ever made have actually seen enough films to qualify for that assumption -- if it is their favorite film, fine, but to say it is THE best film of all time is entirely their opinion, although they seem to take it as a fact.  Have they seen the films of Fellini? Kurosawa? Scorsese? Coppola? ""Citizen Kane""? ""Casablanca""? ""Taxi Driver""? ""Sweet Smell of Success""? ""To Kill a Mockingbird""? ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""? ""Chinatown""? ""Apocalypse Now""? ""2001: A Space Odyssey""? The list goes on!Their definitions of classics range from the time of ""Star Wars"" to present cinema. It may sound like an old argument but it's true -- greater films are harder to find nowadays, and just because ""The Lord of the Rings"" seems like an achievement of some sort, it does not make it the best film of all time. I can name many better films. But, then again, it's my opinion, I suppose.Now that I'm done with my rant, there's nothing left to say. Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) venture closer to Mordor to destroy The One Ring, while Gollum (Andy Serkis) plots to murder them both and take the Ring of Power for himself. (We get to see Gollum's background in the film, too, which is something that will satisfy Tolkien's fans that have read the stories.)Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) returns to the throne of a kingdom (hence the title of the film) to claim his position as heir of Isildur, but first gathers together Legolas and Gimli (Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies) to help battle the Orcs venturing closer to their castle, along with Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen), who opens a can of whoop [butt] in this movie.This is the darkest film of the trilogy. You may have thought ""The Two Towers"" was dark, but ""The Return of the King"" is almost evil -- Frodo gives audiences the creeps a few times. When he says, ""The Ring is mine,"" and grins at Sam with the Elijah Wood grin, a shiver goes down your spine.The film picks up pace starting with the giant arachnid battle, about halfway through the film, and continues down the path of mild greatness until the last twenty minutes, which never seem to end. It is as if Jackson was afraid to close his film for a final time and kept dragging the scenes out -- I don't need to see Frodo and Sam admiring each other more than twice!As the credits rolled, the audience poured out of the theater. ""Wasn't that good?"" I heard someone say. ""No,"" was the reply. ""The Return of the King"" is a very good film, and certainly the best of the trilogy, but don't be fooled by the hype -- this is not one of the best films of all time. It's a case of the Emperor's New Clothes -- some day, someone's going to realize that what they're going on about isn't really there at all. And finally all the film fans will be able to say, ""Y'know, I never really loved the movie all that much anyway."" But for now, I guess we'll all have to put up with more unearned hype.I liked this movie. I liked it a lot at certain points. But I would never, ever call it great. That's just me, I guess.4.5/5 stars.John Ulmer"
tt0167260,"This part three of the trilogy was boring. It was geared to overaged adolescents who love vicarious fights...with digital demons. Ho hum. ""Enough! I wanted to shout,"" ""We Get IT! They had to fight!! Get this blinkin' film over with! I surrender!!""And just when you thought your bum would see the light of day again, wham, ANOTHER ending! My mother and father once (in pre Vatican III days) attended an Italian Catholic high mass wedding. Being Quakers to boot, they had no idea they should have ordered out for pizza and left a wake up call. Each time the congregation rose, they breathed their own silent ""Thank God"" and started to file out, but the guests then en masse kneeled, addressed a different station of the cross,and off things went for another hour.""The Return of the King"" echoed that oft told experience to me. And I wasn't even in a theater. I could have left at any time, but where to file out to at 1AM? It became an ordeal, my own quest to see the turkey through.Now I ask you, Peter Jackson, WHY all the endings??Another thing I noticed in the DVD versions of these three movies; the guy who played Aragon did not do commentary, and did not appear to be pleased with the whole deal to me. He and Liv Taylor had zero chemistry, and I got the sensation he was glad to be done with it. Did anyone else catch this?If I had seen one more, just one more, animated monster, I would have...well, I can't think of anything worse than sitting through the whole darn movie, and I did that anyway, so I will end this diatribe on that note."

tt1375666,"Sci-fi films are loved all around the world these days. 'The Matrix', 'Donnie Darko' and my personal favorite 'Brazil'. But here comes another film by director Christopher Nolan who finished 'The Dark Knight' 2 years ago and now is ready to do another movie. The critics and the audiences loved it. While I consider it as the worst Christopher Nolan film ever. And here's why.Now I must say that I don't think this is horrible. There are quite a lot of good things in this movie. First of all, the special effects are amazing. There's this scene where the other side of the street starts to bend and it meets the other side of the street. Cars are driving upside down and all those crazy things are happening. It was awesome. Second, the music is ground-breaking. There's always this big boom that comes out in the movie and it just makes your heart rattle. Third, the premise is brilliant. The idea of going into a dream and stealing somebody's thought is a premise that only Christopher Nolan can write. It is amazing at those points and I could've liked it.But there is one big problem I had with this movie. And that was the acting. The acting was horribely bland. It has no taste and I just think that the acting starts to get boring. Leonardo Dicaprio's acting has hardened as time went by. He was amazing in one of his first movies 'What's Eating gilbert grape' which is one of my favorite movies of all times. And of course I had a problem with Ellen Page who I thought was so good at acting after I watched 'Juno'. But no, she is so boring in this movie too. The characters doesn't help much. There is not a bit of character development is this movie. And I want good characters when I watch a movie.On the whole, I don't think this movie is terrible. It has its bad and good. I think he should go back to this days of 'The Dark Knight'. I know a lot of people loves this movie but for me, it's the worst Christopher Nolan film ever. But it's worth a watch if you know what a good movie is. I give it 6/10!"
tt0848228,"I just got back from the film on the 27th of April watching Avengers, it's totally worth watching I would not hold back from suggesting anyone to watch it.Through out the whole film there was continuous laughter through out the cinema during the film.It was worth every penny even although it was rather expensive to watch costing ¬£9.85 for a 3d showing at our local cinema in Wigan.I do really hope this short review not giving anything away will help you to decide to whether you want to watch it or not and if you do I hope you will enjoy it like I did when I went watching it.ALso I would like there to be a second film on this because I think that could be even better!"

Was concerned about the Mega Villain.3.Bad reactions on the casting of Mark Ruffalo as HULK.4. Lately, a lot of Super hero movies were flops or average. (Green Lantern & Iron Man)But now, I would definitely ask you all to watch this movie¬Ö.. coz ¬Ö¬Ö.1. The movie has cleverly given the screen time to everybody.2.Loki made a tough Villain to beat alone.3. Everybody loved Mark and as well as the HULK.4.

tt0102926,The book is completely boring. The movie is more interesting. Jodie Foster is the worst actress I ever seen. Obviously she never had any lessons. She can't act and more worse she doesn't open her mouth while she speaks - a disaster without compare. People like Jodie Foster would fail ANY real test for actors. But in Hollywood even the worst actors can earn millions of dollars with technically extreme bad acting. A real joke to pair the technically worst speaking actress with one of the technically best speaking actors (Anthony Hopkins) in a movie where the book is even more boring than the movie. The plot is just like the book illogical IN ANY SENSE.
tt0137523,"Fight Club does exactly what movies should do, blow our minds, make us ask questions of ourselves and our society, and all the while thoroughly entertain us. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are at their very best."
tt0111161,"I really enjoyed the movie .I really was a little bit bored at the first hour and how things get a little bit too much the same thing but everything accelerate after .So we follow two guys charged for murder and both of them live in prison . And we see what happened and how they try to stay strong despite the problems . We know that Dufresne was not guilty but it get there anyway .And the life in prison is a little bit boring but what i really enjoyed are these relationship moments and how they stay together with jokes and they helped each other like a family .Dufresne got a chance to maybe clear his name by a testimony but the director of prison is corrupt and they killed the guy who could save Andy and it was shocking and we felt that injustice .But the big moment its when we know that Andy had made a holemto get out of prison and it was unexpected . We felt like Ellis ( the funny thing is that from the beginning Ellis seemed to know everything and when he get worried about Dufresne that he could do something wrong we get the same worries ) so yeah we get fooled in some ways and that freedom moment in the rain was very well made .Friendship,injustice,Justice are some big themes in that movie . And i really love that they talked about the life before prison and after too . The talk about some prisoners who cant get used to society anymore because they have been in another condition that dont fit in that kind of living so we see the death of that old man and the redemption of Ellis who moved on in life with a new business and project with Dufresne and i really like that opposition of fate about Ellis and the old man . And reinforce that friendhsip was really important .A very nice movie and keep up until the end : you will get surprised about how things turned and about some dialogues who have another meaning ."
tt0372784,"First of all, I'm not against this movie. I found it entertaining, it wasn't boring (and that's rare nowadays), but... I can't understand why critics celebrate this so much. It's not gonna be cinema history as Tim Burton's first film, it's not as dark as the first film, and even the plot is not as good as the first films. There are lots of events in this movie copying Batman 1989's scenes. The escape of Rachel, Batman and Rachel in the Batmobile, then in the Batcave, the dialog is almost the same as the first Batman's. Remember Batman and Vicki Vale in those scenes. The music is not so characteristic, like Danny Elfman's was, and the image of Gotham City is not what a fan imagines. Even the actors: Bale is OK, Caine is good, Liam Neeson is the same as the jedi master, but KAtie Holmes is less than a Batman-girl... first of all, blond looks better in dark Gotham, and after beauties like Kim, Michelle or Nicole she looks more like a mouse. I don't like rewriting the story (The Joker is gonna show up again) and summarizing: it's not what we except from a Batman movie. There are no great stars with charisma like Nicholson, Basinger, de Vito, Pfeiffer or good characters like Christopher Walken was, there's no comic feeling, not dark enough, no cool Gotham or Arkham sets, no Cool Bat-music, no blonde beauties, no good villains... Next time, make the movie more BATMANISH!!!"

Brilliant novel, brilliant adapted screenplay.Not just the novel or screenplay is excellent but the technics also revolutionary. The trilogy nearly opened a new era to Cinema. Some believed even more revolutionary than Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Amazing makeup, breathtaking visual effects, stunning cinematography. The trilogy nearly succeed at all technical subjects."
tt1375666,"I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i'll definitely do the same with Inception.Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that's hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won't happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren't all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it's not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan's latest masterpiece! My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!"
tt0111161,Good movies i ever seen. Good movies i ever seen. Good movies i ever seen.
tt0372784,"I came into this movie with high expectations, but was increasingly disappointed by the end. There was no one aspect that really annoyed me, but rather a lot of smallish things that seemed to taint the experience. Firstly, I thought that Bale was a wise choice for Batman, although I've never really understood what Bruce Wayne has got to do with a bat, but that's not something you could pin on this movie. Well not completely anyway as they attempt to sort of explain it away with the whole fear symbol thing, and the well at the start - still nuts if you ask me... Anyway, that's not important, what is important is the confusion that engulfs our view of Bale throughout the movie. Some of the worst points being: His relationship with his parents - this is not presented very well, with his memories of his father more likely to furrow the brow than produce tears. Bale's motivations - they are not easily understood - why go see Wilkinson's mob boss after he kills the guy who killed his parents. This seems to be a random or arbitrary way to send him off on his quest. Also, what's the deal with his turning on Neeson and his cronies in such a big way on the spur of the moment? One minute he's learning from them - the next he almost kills them all. A tad abrupt perhaps? And speaking of Neeson and his League of Shadows, or whatever, I'll put it simply - their whole plot is ludicrous. How do a bunch of guys living on a mountain succeed in creating a depression in the biggest city in the world, and why do they think it better that a whole city should tear itself apart instead of live with a high level of crime. Surely they could wield the (unlikely) power they seem to have to improve the situation in Gotham? This leads me to the bad guys as a whole. Being from Ireland I was delighted to hear that the two main villains of the film were from here, but on viewing the film I was a bit let down by the way they were used. Neeson and Murphy are both excellent actors and could have been perfect as complicated modern bad guys, but I think they were let down by the script and direction. I was expecting something brilliant from the scarecrow character when he was shown initially, but it all went downhill after his introduction. All he gets to do is spray Batman with his fear thingy and then capitulate in a random sort of way as the plot comes to an end. Why does he turn into a wet blanket when Batman traces him to the asylum and what the hell is with the scene where he gets tazered while sitting on a horse! Neeson starts out very well as a mentor for Bale, but as soon as he comes back to initiate his insane plan he does not make the same impression. His last scene is also rubbish, bearing more of a resemblance to Speed 2 than a great villain death. Also can anyone tell me why a monorail has so much screen time in the film, I know his dad built it, but it's not that interesting... Possibly my biggest complaint about the film is the style with which they shot the action/fight scenes. It's funny that a much lesser known (and also quite silly) film, that also stars Christian Bale, has endlessly better action scenes. If the fight scenes of Batman Begins were more like those in Equilibrium then maybe I would have left the cinema feeling a whole lot more satisfied. As it is they feel like you are watching a brawl in fast-forward, through the bars of a cage. This must surely have annoyed a few people? Altogether, I got the feeling that a large part of the movie was a victim of committee-thinking. Scenes seemed to pop up out of nowhere as if a spare director had been allowed in on one day of the week. Examples of this were the scene where Katie Holmes' co-worker finds the thingummy in the crate - and is then killed. This had me wishing that they served headache tablets with the popcorn, and was made worse by Holmes' brief mention of it again - to explain why she was so crabby at that time - I mean what the hell!!! Anyway, it wasn't all bad, Freeman was fine as the Batmechanic and Michael Caine produced the only real comic moments of the Movie. I didn't think much of Katie Holmes' performance though, she had no central motivation or character trait and suffered from the wishy-washy style of a lot of the movie. Wilkinson and Oldman were also fine. To finish up I would ask those of you who gave this movie a ten: How can you give ten to a movie that has such a crappy, abrupt and ineffectual revelation scene where Bail reveals to Holmes that he is Batman, and how can you give ten to a movie in which Batman's voice sounds like a 12 year old kid playing in his plastic suit? It was almost as terrible as listening to Darth Vader's ""Noooooooooooo""."
tt1130884,"(Synopsis) In 1954, U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are assigned to investigate the escape of a patient at the federal maximum security hospital/prison for the criminally insane located on Shutter Island. Once on the island, they find that the hospital and prison staffs aren't really cooperating with their investigation. It seems that the staff is hiding a big secret and Teddy is going to uncover it. Teddy believes that if he can see the records that he would break the case. In the meantime, the island is hit by a hurricane, and more dangerous patients escape and must be captured. This gives Teddy and Chuck the opportunity to check out some of the buildings to which they had been denied admission. Teddy finds the answer he was looking for.(My Comment) Shutter Island has an eerie atmosphere with flashbacks to the concentration camp at Dachau and haunting dreams throughout the entire movie. At times, you will wonder what is real and what is not. Then you will reach a point where you don't care. I started looking at my watch wanting it to be over. If you are a Leonardo fan and decide to see it, you will see that he does a good job of playing the character, but the creepy storyline is disappointing and is only good enough as a B movie. It will not take you very long to figure out the plot, especially, when you are inside Teddy's head. Overall, this movie is dreary and totally depressing. (Paramount, Run Time 2:18, Rated R) (4/10)"
tt0108052,"I only ever want to see this film once and I will only ever need to see this film once. It is etched on my mind. I, like many others, left in silence. I could not imagine inventing a critical analysis of this film, picking small points of detail or of style, or even scoring points off the Director. The theatrical version juxtaposed images from the film of the actors portraying certain identified ""Schindler Jews"" as each actual person placed a stone on Schindler's grave. The VHS version does not use this device, showing only the actual persons, credited by name. He begs for his life, he knows he's going to die. And the Emperor... pardons him. This worthless man, he lets him go."
tt0172495,"There is much to appreciate about about this picture but at the same time there is much to castigate as well. What could have been a thoroughly involving story turns out to be crippled by a lean script, some very indecisive direction and choppy editing. Not to mention some bad casting in the form of Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, a role which cries out to have been the last role played by Anthony Quinn.The film starts out well and looks bleakly authentic in its depiction of the pivotal battle in the wars between the barbarian tribes of Germania and the Roman Empire. But as the story gives way to 40 minutes of exposition following Commodus and Lucilla's introduction, Ridley Scott seems to tack things on whenever the script runs into weak spots. This leaves the film without a flowing narrative and it seems to want to please a mindless summer movie action market while at the same time aspiring to be something deeper. What it leaves us with is a schizophrenic, unequivocal story full of contradictions.There seems to be an epidemic in the past three or four years - films like this, Titanic, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, Enemy at the Gates etc, try hard to be great epic films but at their core they are very slight and even trivial. The story in Gladiator holds promise but what little conflict there is set up and thrown at us in the first hour, leaving just a linear resolution to unfold for the remainder. A shame because so many elements could have been introduced in this story to make it truly an awesome and thoughtful epic. I guess complex stories like Spartacus and Ben-Hur will never be made again. This one falls somewhere short, though better than Demitrius and the Gladiators and the film it heavily borrows its narrative structure from - The fall of the Roman Empire.Technically the CGI is at times seamless and other times poor. When our troop of Gladiators run into the colosseum for the first time however the effect is absolutely jaw dropping and the scene that follows certainly delivers the action goods. The acting is very good throughout except for Tomas Arana as Quintus (about as bad as John Dall in Spartacus) and the aforementioned Richard Harris.Like Braveheart, not a bad entertainment experience but highly Hollywoodized and with an uneven narrative. But unlike Braveheart, the ending to Gladiator is a just a little embarrassing as it rips off both Braveheart and Titanic to far less effect. If you can get past the flaws, not the worst Roman spectacle on offer. Too highly rated at 8.1/10."
tt0114369,"Se7en is a true classic. Upon release people already knew that this movie was going to be a classic and would be seen for decades to come. With the two Oscar-winning actors Morgan freeman as detective Someset and Brad Pitt as detective Mills in the lead this movie provides a energetic and true acting. Se7en is about a reckless serial killer killing ""innocent"" people related to the seven deadly sins of Christianity. Detective Somerset and Mills are put to on the case, but they're soon to know that the serial killer has a plan for them both. This movie is without a doubt a cult classic film. Because of its unique camera angels and editing as well as its quite absurd ending. It does make you think about the lifestyle that we are living in. Therefore i give this movie a solid 9/10!"
tt0313792,"As usual, somehow, Allen gets you absorbed into the characters, their situations and scenarios.This film concentrates on Allens character David Dobel, teaching a younger version of himself Jerry Falk, that he meets and they continue to meet and have discussions about relationships, psychiatry, work, life and things. Jerry's girlfriend Amanda is summed up by Dobel in the short moment they met and Jerry cannot seem to see exactly what's happening under his own nose... You want Jerry to see what's happening, his inability to break off bad relationships, such as his girlfriend, his manager and his psychiatrist.Allen also manages to direct the scenes to make the cinematography appear as a documentary, very natural, including the minor background scenes and the secondary impulses people have when in dialogue, such as ordering coffee, reactions to bumping into other people, speaking over others and each other."
tt1853728,"So, this is actually my second time watching this one. First time was around 7 years ago or so and I feel like I have matured and gained a better knowledge and understanding of film (I did gain a film degree in this time). So I am rewatching high rated films. And I can safely say this one is amazing!!!The acting is just perfect, Christoph Waltz in particular is just outstanding in every way. In terms of acting performances this film is one of the best I've seen, because everyone is so good.The story is also great. It's interesting and really keeps you sitting there wanting more. I think what is so good about the story is that there isn't any dull moments, every scene has a purpose. A lot of long films feel like they are long for the sake of it and include scenes that are pointless. I didn't get that for Django at all.Obviously this film is also very dialogue heavy (you'd expect that with a Tarantino movie), but it flowed really well and had great action scenes throughout, as mentioned above also it wasn't as dull. A problem I had with Hateful Eight for example was that it focused too much on the dialogue and it did (in my opinion) become bland in places.I'll end it there because I don't want to bang on. But please watch this if you haven't already. I will say, just to end on, that the shock value is ramped right up with this one. Not only do you have a lot of gore (as per), but the use of the n word is almost excessive. Don't say I didn't warn you.But yeah, please watch it's great and you won't be disappointed. There's a reason it's so highly rated on here!!"
tt7286456,"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be."
tt0167260,"I have never loved the first two Lord of the Rings movies. I considered them nothing more than a fine fantasy story, with its smart and silly characteristics, too long and seriously overrated. The fact that these films were thoroughly enjoyed by loads of people I can comprehend easily: the movie's theme appeals to all and I can not deny that it is nicely all nicely put together. But it is still far too long as it lacks a certain...intelligence. Coming to the third installment, I sit and stare. Making fun of a movie is quite easy, what's hard is to understand it. I am not trying to say that this here film has left a mark upon me, but merely that some people are wrong and that I may be as well.SpoilersIt's got some strong points, it's got some weak points and overall it's just what I expected it to be. After a rather pathetic beginning, the movie gets off from where the previous one let us. War, freedom, good and evil, love, trust, friendship, maturity, justice and peace. That's what will concern you once you're in this joint. Some impressive scenes, with sparkles of humor and shallow morality will add up into a massive fight. It's never about the outcome, it's about the way you do it, so I will accept the more shameful moments regarding the story. I might say I would want to admire it all, but it's just too much of a contrast between dark and bright. That's all in this movie but not in our hearts or in our world. Are the characters really complex? Is anyone really worth remembering? They are all weak faced with the power of the ring and none impress in this regard. I try to think of a weakness for us all and I can't find it. This fantasy world is supposed to have one evil which really concerns us, with minor ""misunderstandings"" between people. It's a call for unity, because only through this can we be able to outlive a fight. I fear just that I can not relate to it. I see no war for a common goal. And the problem does not lie around us, it lies within us. We can't find a ring and make all problems disappear after a tremendous quest. That's what makes me feel that The Lord of the Rings is just a story. A long, sporadically remarkable story. But I live in an era of naturalism and realism and I can not accept such a piece of art, as it is, just for the sake of being. I simply can't feel this as a great movie, because so many fates are involved and everything is too perfect. Perfection is bitter sweet, not this film. For me, LoTR is just bitter. But at least not as bitter as the Matrix.Fans will remain fans, detractors will remain detractors. Things don't usually change in life and for that you need to make a great effort. Linear and coherent storytelling adds up in a never ending experience. For most, I am somewhat convinced to say, a superb one. In my heart I feel both joy and pain, because it all means something. The fact that people dream of such a fantasy world, means something. This is not my fantasy world though. This is not my world. 7.5/10"
tt0163281,"Great game. Not for people with motion sickness. Levels, enemies, power ups, etc. are great. Love the secrets in parts of certain levels. Would make a great movie, but not one that would actually be an ""episode"". The sequel has better graphics, but is more confusing and can get you nauseated just as quickly."
tt0313792,"It's sad that many people don't get this movie or find it boring. It is really good. It is not a romance, though. It is more of an anti-romance. It argues for loving yourself over loving others because others will only disrespect you anyway. It shows us where complete narcissism can lead in both positive and negative ways. But it is also very funny and intelligent. The writing and direction are poetic, and Woody makes good use of European-style film techniques--the same sort of stuff Truffaut would still be using if he was still alive. ""Annie Hall"" was not the only movie where a character talked to the audience. People who think this is a remake have not seen many other movies, apparently. Also there is an important visual moment in this movie that shows that having a connection with another can only last so long. Woody literally freezes that moment and it is very bittersweet. I really liked this movie."
tt0361748,"I'm astonished that this film made the top 250 -- indeed, at time of this writing, number 84. I'm guessing that a number of the reviews are written by one-view enthusiasts who haven't very deep roots in film history or film criticism.I was tempted to rate the film at one star just to even things out, but that wouldn't be honest. There are two scenes in this movie that are striking and worthy -- the opening scene where Christopher Walz (Col. Landa) was looking for hidden Jews, and the second when a number of the ""Basterds"" are in a cellar pub trying to make contact with a defecting actress, but are interrupted by unforeseen events. Both scenes, really, are at times breathtaking.But the rest of the film varies between maudlin, unbelievable (even on the terms of its own alternative history) and just plain boring. The references to other films and directors (Hugo Stiglitz? Give me a break!), not to mention the comic book-style titles and all that were really wearying.How many of you think this is really a better film than ""Rebecca""? Or ""The Wizard of Oz""? I thought we only had grade inflation in higher ed ...I can't imagine this film will improve on second viewing, and there is absolutely nothing about it that invites such an investment of my time."
tt0139414,"This movie looked good and scary in the previews, ok?  When I saw it on TV it was not scary at all but funny!  I wonder if the director meant to make this seem funny?  The chitchat between the sheriff and Oliver Platt's character made for some extremely funny dialogue.  I really liked Oliver Platt's character as an alligator enthusiast!  Betty White (of Golden Girls fame) played a great dingbat who feeds her cattle to the giant alligator and even talks about how she killed her husband.  There was nothing scary about this movie at all.  Bridgett Fonda was funny in this and Bill Pullman was the same as he always is.  I like his characters a lot but they all talk the same.  I would suggest NOT renting this but I would also suggest NOT turning the station if you happen to see it on television.  Great for laughs.  But not a horror movie in the slightest."
tt0120737,"Extremely boring and long movie with poor storyline. The action and special effects were great, some moments got me hooked tho, but those are tiny upsides in comparision."
tt0109830,"It's hilarious, and it is tragic.Tom Hanks is...amazing as Forrest Gump, striking the balance between ""stupid"" and ""normal"", as many choose to describe people.There's parts where you can feel how sad it is, but it's not crammed in there, or overpowering. It strikes the right balance with the comedy.Somehow, this movie has found a way to be underrated, as it has 70% on Rotten Tomatoes from the critics."
tt0167260,"This film was so chalk full of cheesy one liner's that one wondered what happened to the script writers.Gandalf the wizard was reduced to a swordwieilding soldier who merely clubs over the head those who disagree with him.What is clear is that Jackson, Boyens, and Walsh do not have a firm grasp of the source text.One can discern script weaknesses clearly as confused actors muddle through dialogue that they know is suspect at best (see Mortensen's (aragorn) speech at the crowning of the king).I laughed and I cried, but for all the wrong reasons.Rest in peace professor Tolkien, however difficult that may now seem to be."
tt0167261,"IMDb Top 250: 30 The Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers continues the epic story that began in Fellowship of the Ring. We meet new characters, develop others, and see epic battles.There is such a phenomenon in film called 'Middle film syndrome' or something of the sort. It means that in a trilogy, the middle film is the weakest because it isn't exposition like the first film, or conclusion like the third. The Two Towers is a perfect example of this concept. The awe of Fellowship isn't present, and the finish of Return of the King doesn't happen, leaving... the middle.I'm not trying to say Two Towers is a bad film. But compared to the other Lord of the Rings films, it is. They're AAA, Towers is AA. The characters introduced, like the King and nephew in Rohan, are thrown into the story without a reasonable introduction. The battle for Helm's Deep isn't that spectacular. Humour is misplaced. Even the films colour is wrong. Some of these factors can't really be fixed, because of the books, but some of them should've been dealt with.There are still some great parts of Two Towers. Gollum is nuts, batty and crazy. His presence helps Frodo and Sam's scenes, which don't actually go anywhere. The Dead Marshes are creepy. Ringwraiths return- on new mounts. And the tree battle, the only epic scene in the movie.Most of my problems with Two Towers are that the scale is diminished, no scenes other than the battle at Isengard leave the viewer in awe. The battle for Helm's Deep was also... not great. The sides weren't even close to being reasonable, making the result unbelievable. The colouring of the last battle made it seem very dark and bleak, but Gimli became a walking joke and Legolas rode a shield/surfboard. Clashing themes. The orcs didn't have anything special in that battle to make the battle interesting. In a series with groundbreaking battles, Two Towers came up short.The Two Towers is a good film, but a mediocre Lord of the Rings film. If for some reason you see it before the other two, the others are far better. Not much else I can say, you're either in it for all 3 or not in it. Fear not, Return of the King is the strongest, a worthy finish of your time. 8.3/10"
tt0848228,"Avengers turned out to be as thrilling and exciting as its first teaser. I was waiting for this movie from the time they announced it and my joy knew no bounds when I saw the movie tonight. In one word ‚Äì Superb. I don't mind watching it once again. S.H.I.E.L.D director, Nick Fury is threatened by Loki and his armed forces. Loki is sinister brother of Thor who was dethroned from Kingdom of Asgard for his misdeeds. He plans an attack on Earth by opening a portal through which his army can arrive into the Earth from Asgard and wage a war against mankind and turn human into Loki's slave. In order to protect Earth from destruction, Nick Fury assembles a team of superheroes represented by Ironman , Captain America , Thor and Hulk along with Black Widow and HawkEye. Together , they must fight the evil Loki before he captures the people of earth and turns them into his slave It would have been really challenging for Joss Whedon, director of Serenity, to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise he did a fantastic job and turned this comic-story into a must-see film. The movie begins by introducing each superhero character and their personalities. Of course, if you would have followed their original parts then this will be easy to continue. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half is more of story building where as it is the 2nd half which gathers steam and makes it more entertaining. Couple of scenes that easily stands out are the introduction of Hulk , the fight between Thor and Ironman and especially the climax scenes where the main fighting is depicted. Screenplay is effective along with punching dialogues Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast. Robert Downey Jr. clearly stands out in his portrayal of Ironman and witty one- liners. He is just getting better with each film. Surprisingly, I liked Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/The Hulk. His puts in so much effort and is complete natural when as Bruce Banner and his change of expression as The Hulk. Overall , an action-packed entertainment with good storyline , lovely performances and superb CGI. It is a must see film which will give you an urge to go for the second time as well. Excellent 4/5"
tt0313792,"Nestled in between two films that did almost nothing for me is a little-known gem, Anything Else. The film, released in 2003 starring Jason Biggs and Christina Ricci follows a doomed romance between a couple of neurotic individuals as they are finding their way in life chasing careers and happiness. Anything Else, written and directed by Woody Allen, is a prime example that there is something in Woody Allen's filmography for anyone. If you don't care for the reimagining of one life into both a comedy and a tragedy, or a scathing look at the personalities that are behind the Hollywood machine, then there's a romantic tragi-comedy in between. Again I'm stunned at the claim that Woody Allen is a one-dimensional filmmaker who repeatedly tells the same story. Woody has played with his story structure, genre-jumped, and embarked on many artistic exercises all the while maintaining his laser focus on life's big questions through his perfectly-penned scripts.Jerry Falk (Jason Biggs) is just beginning his career as a comedy writer under the mentorship of David Dobel (Woody Allen). Dobel, as he is referred to, has gone through a couple of careers, successfully holding himself back from pursuing comedy full time. Jerry and Dobel meet daily to discuss avenues for their comedy writing, as well as all of life's many issues. The main issue they seem to always discuss is the fact that Jerry has a problem severing ties with anyone. Jerry's still with the same leach of a manager he's been with his entire professional life, he remains in a relationship that he has been unhappy with for some time and continues to pay for meetings with a psychoanalyst who barely pays attention to Jerry during his sessions. Needless to say, Jerry has a problem cutting off relationships, even if they don't serve him. Early on in the film, we see Jerry meet Amanda (Christina Ricci) who is dating one of his friends at the time, and the two instantly fall in love. Jerry breaks the 4th wall to let the audience know that his relationship doesn't work out, however, and the rest of the film explores what caused their relationship to deteriorate and how Jerry can best approach the rest of his life to avoid reliving the disappointments he has already experienced.What I wouldn't give to be in Jerry's position and be able to occupy a park bench and have daily conversations with Woody Allen about philosophy. Although I dispel the notion that Woody Allen is a one- dimensional filmmaker, there are certain aspects of his craft that remain the same throughout each of his films, to the benefit of the audience. Certainly, no one would complain that Woody Allen's perfectly biting scripts, or his heavily jazz-influenced scores, or his willingness to explore the medium he chose continue to pop up through his entire filmography. I appreciate that Woody Allen continued to play with the story structure of his films and reuse those experiments that work. I've noted before that I enjoy a well- done breaking of the 4th wall, and Woody is certainly a director that can utilize that method effectively. What I also enjoy that others seem not to, is how Woody is constantly grappling with the issues in life he personally struggles with. Life's meaning has been grappled with through film in a number of different ways, and I don't think Woody's method should be looked down upon because it largely does so through comedy. A few of Woody Allen's films in a row, I've discovered through this retrospective project, have dealt with the idea of relationships and regret. Again in Anything Else we meet a protagonist who admits that he enters a relationship that is doomed to fail before it ever begins. Is this an exploration of the belief that self-sabotage saves us true disappointment? Could it be indicative of an idea that relationships limit the essential human spirit, effectively ending the pursuit of life's meaning because once a relationship begins we fill our lives with distractions and stop considering purpose? I can't pretend to know what Woody Allen is going for in his films, but I can say that I am happy he keeps exploring his ideas through his art."
tt0848228,"At first when I heard of this show, I was kinda excited about it. But when I went to the cinemas yesterday to watch it, I was tempted to leave my seat already at the early part of the show. It's not the characters or actors that is horrible, it's the director to be honest. I don't know how the script writers come what with this or even how the director approve it, but the lines and conversation were so fake, blunt and seriously horrible. It lakes emotions, feelings or even creativeness. Let alone, the whole plot is too predictable and boring. No doubt the action scenes is good and the graphic is awesome, but the plot and horrible lines just make this show right at the bottom of my list for shows in 2012. I rather watch ""The Dark Knight"" anytime rather than this horrible show. Even friends of mine who are crazy about DC and Marvel comics were absolutely disappointed in this show. In fact, they leave the theatres during halfway of the show. This is just an example to show how horrible it is. All in short, this show to me is not worth watching or buying and was a waste of 143 minutes of my time."
tt0361748,"What is the deal with this movie? I was bored out of my skull during this movie. I don't know if I missed something, but I thought this movie was terrible. I would also like to mention that I watched this in my home on Movies on Demand. I saw it with my dad and friend, and we all basically wanted to turn it off. The only reason we watched the whole thing was that when I finally snapped and decided i was done watching, the piece of garbage was nearly over. I see that it's high on the list of best movies of all time for IMDb ratings. This really does baffle me. I was not intrigued with the plot at all. The parts that were meant to be funny did not translate for me. I really thought this movie was lame."
tt0111161,"It's boring, i don't care about the characters. Overrated to madness. The movie could have been way darker, feels like a disney adventure.Great acting, ok story."
tt0133093,"Yeah, the effects were good.  But the story was just your basic, run-of-the-mill futuristic action script.  The character development is virtually non-existant, the acting is weak, and their are non plot twists that cannot be spotted a mile ahead.  The only reason this film is praised so much is because of the martial arts sequences and the effects i.e. the famous slow-motion bullet shots.  But the fact remains that this is a poor effort.  There is no outstanding reason to see this movie; there is no great acting.  The story is intriguing to sci-fi fans at first, but later on boils down to cliches and shootouts.  The ending is a cop-out just so more sequels can be milked out.If you want to see a great futuristic sci-fi film, see The 13th Floor.  You will notice the plot is very similar to that of The Matrix, except it is much more inventful about it, much better executed, and the ending will leave you thinking for months afterwards.  The ending in the Matrix, however, will leave you thinking ""What was so great about that?""  The answer, simply and disapointingly, is nothing."
tt0993846,"An accusation that can be convincingly levelled at Scorsese, especially in his weaker moments, is that he wants to have his cake and eat it. Is he celebrating, lampooning, or critiquing alpha masculinity... or is he doing some combination of all three? In the later part of his career this film is the prime example of that - I'm never quite sure where he lands, and I don't think he truly is either. There's some brilliant performances; and one scene between Margot Robbie and DiCaprio towards the end is genuinely upsetting. But the relentless, frenetic pace of much of the previous three hours does seem to dwarf that; not to mention what comes after it. Three hours of that pace of editing and that volume of sound is just too much; and there seems to be a bit too much comedic enjoyment gained from morally reprehensible behaviour to convince the film is sufficiently nuanced. Not to say there isn't plenty to admire and enjoy - but by Scorsese's standards this leaves the wrong kind of taste in the mouth."
tt0993846,"I am going to amend my review below, as I have had several days to mull over the tragic depth this to which awful movie has taken us. It might be clever 'Scorscese' film making, but really it is a horrible excessive movie about utter pigs. Yes I get the 'haha they are drug animals without consciousness' but really. Hasn't Marty just also steamrolled right over the line of what can be put on a mainstream movie. I think this film is filth. Just depravity and a sad new low to what can appear on a multiplex cinema screen. Leonardo is so well liked and to see Marty excess the reasonable acceptability by having this young man and all other actors just degrade themselves so they can appear in a 'Martin Scorscese film' ... well it is a hollow victory. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is a degrading sad film made by an old man who likes to see good looking young people degrade themselves for his own gratification. He has insulted and degraded the entire film making system and those who participated in this ridiculous ugly mean film by being willing to undress and make ugly naked faces of themselves. It is horrible and a new low, the lowest since HOSTEL 2 in mainstream American movie making and nothing to admire or be proud of. I am sad for US film making and Scorscese needs to retire. It's grubby and Marty has grubbied young admirable talented Leonardo. Bad Bad and sad.Martin Scorscese had outed himself as a defiler. A defiler and corrupter of youth.My previous statement: Yes it is a very clever film, well edited acted and written. However like that 10th line of cocaine, by the third hour of WOLF OF WALL STREET there is an overdose imminent. Some films can be too clever for their own endurance test, and whilst there is much to guffaw at and much to be faux-shocked at, after 120 minutes and before 172 minutes I just became bored with the whole thing. Again we get the hyperactive Scorscese swooshing narrative and the pantomime of men-without-a-conscience and the terrible things they do to each other, their women and the audience. It is all colossal and then after it is over, I am glad I will never feel like watching any part of it ever again. Three hours without story suspense, a bit of character build, just episode after episode of CASINO/SCARFACE/NY blather, and yes we have seen it all before. How poor Thelma ever edited this bombastic overload of brute force money avalanche greed etc etc and not lost her mind having to watch it over and over and over again whilst tweaking it into its releasable shape, to me is another more interesting story deserving of an Oscar. I admired the production more than I liked the film."
tt0109842,"This movie is really giving a bad perspective to people that has never been in New York, showing that deaths,drugs and all those insane things are something regular in New York like a everyday thing when it really isn't is making us look bad as a New Yorkers, making us look like drug dealers, killers and unfair and disrespectful to others. And it also make Fresh look really smart for a kid of his age and I kind of like it the way he was like the way he acts, and he also planned every move he would make during his actions while messing with gangster and drug dealers and all those dangerous people that were around him while growing up during his childhood"
tt0167260,"I think the vast majority of people who have seen and love the LOTR trilogy fell in love with it from the get go with the 1st film TFOTR. I, however, wasn't so sure when I first saw the Fellowship. I enjoyed it, yes, but elements of that film left me somewhat disappointed and in particular my preconceived feeling of what its general tone would/should be like wasn't satisfied. Now, some years on, as the proud owner of the special extended edition dvds I can announce that the series has grown on me somewhat and I find all three movies an immensely satisfying experience to sit through.I could criticize the Return of the King in a nit-picking manner, it is far from perfect, but as we all know, nothing is perfect. What appeals to me most in this film is its beautiful nature, which will shine through for many years to come. And isn't the nature of things that which truly matters. Themetically strong, and new to the series, emotionally powerful, ROTK is a worthy conclusion to the trilogy. Never have I witnessed the theme of death dealt with in such a positive manner, which works for me, although it's true I'm not on my way to A&E as I write this.Congratulations to Mr Jackson and all involved in the making of this trilogy and the bringing to life of Middle Earth. Their efforts have produced something special.Lastly, although ROTK would narrowly miss out on my top 5, probably pushed out by Luke's Cool Hand (see what I did there?), I'm delighted to see it ranked #2 here on IMDb."

tt0111161,"What can I possibly add to a review corpus of over 1.2 million ratings and three thousand reviews? This movie has been called ""one of the best movies of all time"", ""a powerful story about friendship, hope and freedom"" and a ""latter-day retelling of the Gospel story"". Many people have seen this movie multiple times, and some claim it has changed their lives and even saved their lives.At this point, I'm rather more interested in the phenomenon than the movie. My take on it: this movie appeals enormously to ordinary people (especially American men) who feel trapped by difficult situations in their lives. Some may be looking to be rescued, like Red was; others may take comfort in the thought that their long-term pain, tedium and oppression will someday result in a spectacular liberating event. This movie satisfyingly scratches that annoying itch called ""life is unfair"".It's difficult to know what to think about all this. Whatever you think about the phenomenon, ""Shawshank Redemption"" is also just a good movie with excellent writing, black and white characters, a simple but satisfying plot with a few surprising scenes, great acting, and a certain amount of tear jerking. It's not a movie to be missed."
tt0372784,"The action sequences are tedious, overlong and boring. The whole nonsense with the ninja gang in Asia is a jumbled ridiculous mess. Best part is the assembly of the batman stuff, but the car is also a very uncool contraption. The long car chase scene with is pointless. Katie seems lost. The first 40 minutes or so goes by rather slowly and is of little interest. The fight scenes are not well done, difficult to see what is happening, and of little interest.This is a potentially good indicator movie for me, and I really need one, with the high percentage of loser movies coming out nowadays. If a critic loves this I can chalk that up to poor judgment.While Mr. & Mrs. Smith is totally mindless it is actually a lot of fun, is exciting for most of it."
tt0172495,"This movie is awesome! I think it's great to be in one of IMDb's top 250 best movies, because it deserves it. Every time I watch 'Gladiator'I stay touched by the story and I never get bored of it.It's one of the most excellent movies already made in the movie's history! Russel Crowe is terrific in the role of Maximus and so is Joaquim phoenix great as commodus. For people who enjoys history,specially ancient history,is a chance to see how was Rome many centuries ago, and also know better about the gladiators, the Colosseum and how some things worked in that time.I will not write about the plot here, because many people already did this; I will only say for people that never watched this movie, that it deserves to be watched and, if you have some money, buy the DVD!"
tt7286456,"Not sure if the controversy of the film was justified. Have people forgotten taxi driver? This is nothing new and as a comic book film it falls flat. Phoenix is great in the role but there just wasn't enough to go on and it was a muddled mess. I expected so much more from all the hype this film had and maybe that's why I'm just not impressed by it. It's worth a watch for sure but with no sequel... ""THE END"" and no Batman film to incorporate it with, then honestly what was the point anyway?"
tt0120737,"When I bought this movie I thought it was going to be a grand epic adventure. Although it was that, it failed to keep my attention. I have a very good attention span and never fall asleep during movies but I just couldn't sit still during this movie. The story was good and the directing was good but it lacked action. Not fighting action but I mean as in stuff happens because nothing really happens. Its very corny ""You shall not pass!""so corny. Reminds me of a Dungeons and Dragons meet or something. Although the last movie in the series is good,this certainly isn't; I had a tough time falling asleep once so I decided to watch this movie and that became my replacement for warm milk. Great for fans but for anyone else this will fail to catch your interest."
tt0110912,"This movie may be the most overrated film of all time, in my opinion. There is no point. It is not particularly funny. It is not particularly thought provoking. It is not some kind of masterpiece. It is, however, well made. Has good acting with a great cast. Is a fun way to divide up the scenes and plots.I was ready for this movie to end far before it did, because I learned about halfway through that there is just no purpose to it! No meaning! I definitely enjoyed aspects of it and there was some legitimate tension, without question. It all just felt messy. Truly my favorite part of watching pulp fiction were two scenes that I had seen from different memes 100 times before, and never knew where they came from. It was a, ""oh, hey, I recognize this image!"" That was the most joy I got out of this.By no means is it a trainwreck, but to be considered such a timeless masterpiece of cinematic glory? Not a chance. I would like to speak to every single person who gives this a 10 and have them explain to me what exactly this film does well, because I feel pretty confident everyone just gets in line and calls it amazing because that is the 'cool' thing to do."
tt0468569,"There's a villain, full of colour, takes to the stage, a double crossing trickster seeks to enrage, a Mafioso kind of broker, it's the one and only Joker, hands of torment, turmoil, torture's what he'll rage. A triumvirate of Gotham forms a cordon, The Batman, Harvey Dent, Lieutenant Gordon, but they're seduced by the performance, limited by laws conformance, the playmaker relishing, all the destruction. It's not too long before their weaknesses are found, as hostages are taken to compound, ultimatums are presented, prominent profiles are demented, and our hero runs for cover, goes underground."
tt0848228,"'The Avengers' is a brilliant cartoon with tremendous flair, style, and more than it's share of silliness. Director Joss Whedon is allowed free reign to present a massive spectacle of action and destruction and it is often very visually spectacular and often more than fun. Is 'The Avengers' the comic book masterpiece awaited for years by geeks everywhere? No. It isn't even Marvel's best offering as an independent studio. The only level 'The Avengers' really succeeds on is being a huge cartoon. It offers nothing truly unique in realm of dealing with these characters or their mythology. If the modern day comic book is a romanticized colorful dissection of hero worship and good and evil as I and a great many comic book fans like to think it is than Joss Whedon has ultimately failed in respecting that and using it to give his audiences something to chew on. In a great many ways I found myself brought back to the horrendous experience last summer of watching another huge action spectacle, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon'. 'The Avengers' is in many ways the same movie, neither have any sense of stakes other than to make sequels. Iron Man, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, and Thor are here to sell toys and tickets.Epicness is what is on the table in this film and Joss Whedon surely does deliver an epic action packed film. Delivering an action packed film isn't all that hard to do though. There are no stakes to 'The Avengers'. Missing is a sense of dread and threat. I wanted our heroes to really be tested by something bigger than themselves and they aren't. I sing the praises of Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' and you know what Jon Favreau's first 'Iron Man' film because they truly brought our characters to a point where they had to question what made them heroes and if being a hero was more than just paraphernalia. Both films created tremendously strong villains which served as representations of all that could be corrupted and made evil within the title heroes. The threat in 'The Avengers' comes in the form of a pretty lame mcguffin. We find out next to nothing about the tesseract cube other than it can blow stuff up in a Michael Bay-esque fashion. The threat to our heroes is pretty dull and lackluster. Often our heroes have to spend time reminding us they are saving the world because we forget. I wanted to be reminded that our heroes bleed and can die. Kill off a sacrificial lamb and keep me interested. (I know the retort here about Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson and he is a very fun character but he merely serves as a second rate sidekick)I think every actor in here is having a blast in their roles and I love seeing it. I don't necessarily think they are all taking their roles seriously but I do think they are engaging all the great things that make these characters pulp icons. My favorite performance has to be Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Loki isn't all that rounded a villain or character but Hiddleston loves the comic book nature of the character. Saying you want to take over the world often is a silly empty threat and yet if someone says it the right way it is fun.The final battle scene is grand as promised. Is it fun? Yes. That is something I do want to reiterate because the film is fun. There is something to be said about enjoying eye candy and things blowing up. 'The Avengers' is a masterpiece if that is what we are concerned with. Does the battle go on too long? I didn't check my watch nearly as much as I did during 'Dark of the Moon' but yes it is drawn out. I think I wouldn't feel this way though had the problems mentioned earlier been addressed. The chitauri are just plot pieces and even though we see our heroes take some hits never do we see any real toil this has on them. What is 'The Avengers'? A cartoon. The kid in me was satisfied with all the action but the adult in me wanted more.I think with 'The Avengers' we have a cinematic Rorschach with everyone getting something they want out of it and rating it much higher than it truly deserves. I saw it opening weekend and have pondered over it amidst the fanfare. Is it a good film? Yes, if you hold it up as a summer blockbuster it is an exceptional fun filled ride. Is it a substantive film? No, if you want a substantive comic book film than see 'The Dark Knight' or 'Iron Man'."
tt0108052,"""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.""'Schindler's list is about the true story of Czech born Oskar Schindler, a businessman who tried to make his fortune during the Second World War by exploiting cheap Jewish labour, but ended up penniless having saved over 1000 Polish Jews from almost certain death during the holocaust.'Steven Spielberg's best film, by far! His camera work in the film is unique.40% of this film is used with a hand-held camera. There were no steadicams or crane shots used. His efforts were to make it look more like a documentary and his effects were great! The black and white effect used only adds to the depression. The editing of colour throughout is very powerful, examples include the candles burning, the girl in the red coat and the ending sequence.The acting presented is amazing. Liam Neeson brings an Academy Award worthy performance to the screen. His transition from a greedy business man to humanitarian is marvellous. Ralph Fiennes is also great in the film. He plays Amon Goeth, an SS officer who is sadistic and psychopathic, frequently murdering his prisoners for fun. A performance not many can accomplish. Ben Kingsley is amazing portraying Itzhak Stern. He makes my favourite scene. As Stern figures out that Schindler is using his own money to rescue Jews, his face expression says it all. Very emotional.The Score in this film is magic. In my opinion, it's the music that brings out the most of the emotion in the film. John Williams is brilliant!Schindler's List will not only go down as the best holocaust film ever made but one of the best films in the history of cinema."
tt0137523,"I had high hopes in this movie with all the positive reviews I saw. But in the end it became the worst movie I saw in my life. In other words, I was disgusted by just seeing him, I couldn't stand being in my seat, I wanted to stop and change the movie. And that's saying a lot. There is a Mexican novel that I thought was the worst in history. I was wrongStarting with the disastrous script that was not going anywhere, someone tell the director that he is making a movie, the dialogues looked like those of a book. I never read it, but it shows that it was copied faithfully. I felt as if the author was smoking marijuana while writing the book, there is quite a chance that it is true. It was an insult to writers who at least know that someone is going to read their works and they take seriously the construction of the plot by making a beautiful rise and fall with the subplots. Arriving at a conclusive climax.Contrary to the fight club that throws up the viewer showing random scenes without relevant content and sex scenes or related things without context that did not contribute to the plot just because, ""I am very depressed and edgy""In the end it is only a film that was the most popular because certain stupid Yanks had never seen any work related to depression and went to the first film they saw of that style and called it a masterpiece to reflect their pathetic life in that. 1/10"
tt0068646,"If you enjoy action paced movies with great character depth and story telling opt for goodfellas. If you like slow paced, drama like story telling opt for the Godfather. It's wasn't my cup of tea but you can see why people might put it into being considered a classic. The movie for the time when released was ahead of its time. Nowadays it would go straight to dvd."
tt1853728,"I enjoyed this action/comedy movie because I hated the evil doers and wanted to see them die because of their brutal natures. I reveled in their pain. And that's the problem.I'm going along about half way on this one because the performances are as good as they are and I can appreciate Quentin Tarantino's collegial sense of humor. Two ""Django's"" shaking hands. Brunhilde and Siegfried coming out of nowhere. A musical score that is an homage to Ennio Morricone. The surprises that pop out of a man's mouth or his sleeve.Tarantino's earlier stuff was pretty good -- ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"" -- and ""Jackie Brown"" was finely written and directed, a very nice piece of work. The ""Kill Bills"" was far too stylized for me.""Inglourious Basterds"" was a disappointment. It was much more violent than anything else he's done, and instead of comic internal conflicts, he'd chosen as villains the Nazis, the most evil people of the century, and their torture and murder could be endorsed without chagrin by the least sophisticated of us, the kind who think ""Don't just kill the enemy; torture them before killing them."" It was a kind of pornography for the millions.He's followed the same course here and I didn't like it much. Given the depraved character of the slave-owning Southerners, no punishment is too harsh, so Django can kill helpless and unarmed people -- including women -- at will. As a hero, the character of Django is not just flawed but practically turned inside out. Superman was a hero Roy Rogers was a hero. Django was a walking abattoir, savagely killing everyone he disliked -- and Tarantino has provided him with a the simple-minded excuse of hating that ""peculiar institution."" I don't want him as my hero. He's too Old Testament for me.The performances are good, though, and the production values high. Jamie Foxx has about two notes on his instrument but Christoph Waltz does a great job as the German bounty hunter. His accent doesn't sound German at all. It sounds like it came from somewhere in outer space. And Don Johnson is surprisingly chipper and colorful as Big Daddy, the plantation owner who gets splashily offed by Django's powerful rifle. (The squibbs seem to have had double charges.) Tarantino obviously has a lot of talent and a keen sense of humor. I wish he'd get back to his roots and lay off the easy targets."
tt0133093,"You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work."
tt0137523,"I had avoided this movie as I had assumed it was 'Rocky Goes Underground'. Saw it last night (May 2013) only because my son wanted to watch it and I was too tired to get off the couch. I was totally blown away. It has no resemblance to Rocky or any other boring boxing movie.Can't stop thinking about it today, certainly can't concentrate on work. Why? Because I totally identify with The Narrator and it seems from the comments here and from the consensus of viewer ratings that I am far from alone. Its not 'Macho Porn', or 'little-boy posturing' as Roger Ebert describes it. It is rather one of the most thought provoking movies I have ever seen.I unleashed my own Tyler Durden 10 years ago, not violently or illegally, but I did turn my back on my serf-like existence as a well- paid corporate slave. Sure it was painful and chaotic. But my marriage survived and now I run my own small business. Sometimes I think I made a mistake, as my former affluent life sure was easier. But it takes a movie like this to remind me how empty it was and how much more satisfying it is to take the road less travelled, to forge my own destiny, to have a proper work life balance that allows me to know my kids and to not be sucked into hollow consumerism."
tt7286456,"This film is about mental illness. Specifically, a mental illness called creative diarrhoea.Seriously though, there is sooo much wrong with this movie. I won't even start with how I knew that a Joker sob story had no hope of (artistic) success, nor with why I went I went to see it anyway. I'll start by pointing out other reviewers' observation that this is not even the Joker. He's not suave, he's not witty, there are no lethal gimmicks, no morbid jokes, no anarchism, and he isn't a criminal mastermind. He's just a loser that goes off on a school shooter streak.Secondly, this is not, as I said earlier, a film about mental illness. It is a mockery of it, cashing in on the increasing awareness about mental health. There is not one concept about psychosis or other mental health problems judiciously explored in the movie (an illness which causes the sufferer to laugh in inappropriate situations? Seriously?!). All you're getting here is a downtrodden loner being subjected to beatings and injustices designed to spark indignation in the viewer, then going off on a murder spree.With regards to the much-praised acting, it's a mystery to me how anyone could have come to a judgement of Phoenix's theatrical achievement based off such an asinine script, because I can't. Not that you should devote an iota of attention to any of these positive reviews, because I'm fairly confident that there is some large-scale review rigging going on.The plot is one dimensional and juvenile, the dialogue as engaging as a monotone nursery rhyme and the character development shallow. There were goofs left right and centre, like revolvers with zero recoil and 8 bullets. Why did Arthur keep dancing? Why did we need to see Arthur fondling himself? Why is he so emaciated? Why so much smoking? I watched so many close-ups of cigarettes burn out it makes me wonder if the film was sponsored by the tobacco industry.The two positives in the movie for me were firstly, the final talk show scene, littered though it was with imperfections like the rest of the movie, which did have me sitting a little less slouched in my seat. Also, there were some interesting theories presented tying the Joker with the Batman.With the bar set so high by The Dark Knight, no director seeking artistic acclaim will go near the Joker for many years to come, maybe ever, but on the other hand, the Joker character has been rendered a boon for Hollywood opportunists, and this is the second time we've seen the character butchered in a low effort high budget money maker. This one will be forgotten quick, but I don't know how long it will be before the Joker himself recovers."
tt0993846,"Martin Scorsese redoes Goodfellas in the financial sector. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort, a young man immediately smitten with the ruthlessness of Wall Street (at first represented by Matthew McConaughey in a hilarious cameo). After the market sees a startling crash in the late '80s, DiCaprio gets pushed out of the big leagues. He quickly finds a way in smaller markets, pushing penny stocks. He figures out ways, not all of them strictly legal, to make cash hand over fist. Soon, paired with new best friend Jonah Hill, he opens his own firm. All the rules go out the door as he pulls in millions of dollars a year, which leads to all sorts of drug-fueled mayhem. The draw here is the pure debauchery. It will surely offend some, but the pure spectacle of depravity is enormously amusing. The film really doesn't want to think too hard about the awful things that Belfort is doing, which is kind of a bold choice. Sure, he does end up suffering in the end, but, with all he experienced beforehand, the little bit of suffering seems almost worth it. It could easily be argued that it's a hugely immoral film, but I think it just wants to put us in the action. The film has an epic runtime, which isn't really deserved. I wasn't exactly bored with it (though I was feeling it physically), but it could have been shortened. DiCaprio gives one of his best performances, but I was most amused by Hill. Many will despise his abrasive character, but I thought he was hilarious."
tt0468569,"It starts with a pretty good story line, and good characters, Batman, the mob, the joker, and the attorney are all OK.

tt1345836,"I decided to write a re-review of The Dark Knight Rises because after seeing it a third time, you lose the hype, you lost the excitement because that is all done with. You can really focus on the movie, and I felt like I was never able to do that with the first review I wrote. I would probably have to say this is at least my second favorite Batman movie-- after Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight following closely at number three. You never realize the first go around, while TDKR is drastically different than BB & TDK in terms of it's style, it's that style that sets it apart from any of the previous entries.You get subtle hints to the grand picture of it all through tidbits throughout TDKR. A lot of people have different beliefs, whether or not Alfred was imagining Bruce near the end of the movie, but I believe it was a real vision. Bruce was finally happy, and left his old life behind. I also believe it is real because Alfred never was aware of Bruce and Selina growing fond for each other towards the end of the movie, and she was sitting next to Bruce at the diner. Bruce Wayne is ""dead"" but not the Batman. It is emotionally satisfying because now you see Bruce a character you cared for, finally have a life worth living. He's at peace.I ultimately believe Blake becomes Batman, for one the Bat signal is repaired. Bruce gives him the coordinates to the Batcave. And for all you Batman fanatics, remember in Batman Begins, Bruce told Alfred after being gone for seven years, ""As a man I can be destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be everlasting. I could be incorruptible"", or something a long those lines, and I look at that and tie it in with John Blake's character of indeed becoming Batman.Some of those points I mentioned is what makes TDKR such a joy to watch. So thoughtful, and emotionally engaging. Nolan definitely did give justice to the franchise. When I first seen it I felt like it was the least favorite of mine but still enjoyable-- but now I'd have to say it is my second favorite out of all the three, maybe even my favorite one in the trilogy!9.0/10"
tt0816692,"With a great deal of effort I managed to watch this movie in its entirety. That was because the storyline was peculiar enough for me to say - I need to see how the film is going to (hopefully) tie-together. Thus that positive brought my rating up to a 4. On the negative-side:1) this movie is 2.5 hr of tedious lack-of-action. 2) most dialogue is mumbled - sounding like a new foreign language, or low in volume. 3) Those dialogue issues thus made it near impossible to follow the complex plot ""reveals"". 4) The special effects were not 2014-quality. The spaceship shots reminded me of circa-1980's Battlestar Galactica. 5) Plot problem: the pilot (MM) is enlisted to fly the spaceship because he was a great pilot many years ago. The next thing you know he's at the controls of a very complex spaceship that he has never seen. I guess if the writer suggested that the pilot went thru months of training', would have just dulled this movie further. It would be like Rocky fighting Apollo Creed, without showing the side-of-beef being hit, and running the City Hall steps.Anyway this is not a great movie in any sense. A story that tries to play on the themes of : 1) Love overcomes all, and 2) a father's love for his family can overcome the physics of the universe, are just predictable emotional-appeals (of the writer/producer) - trying to salvage something at the box-office, from the audience being left with a ""feel-good"".A great story + being well executed + an emotional-appeal = an 8 to 10 rating. This movie is just a lifeless, jumbled bore."
tt0114369,"I had been waiting a long time to see this movie and I finally had the chance. #42 all time? 8.4 on IMDb? Man it must be GREAT.Instead, what I watched was a slow, almost boring movie. Where were the great twists? It was amazingly predictable. Guys print on a wall? Bet he's missing a finger or hand. Guy starved to death? Bet he's still alive, why else would they so lovingly pan over the body? Friday the 13th did that, too. Nice serene music and BAM! I wasn't counting on Seven being a ""slasher film"" but it sure seems to have followed many of the ""tricks"" of cheaper slasher films.There was some character development, I guess, and i'm sure that slowed things down a bit, but that hardly made this a great film.And why was it so damned dark half the time! IT ISN'T NECESSARY! Man I hate that in movies.Anyways, i'm sure some will love it. I found it totally run of the mill, with a lot of wasted star power."
tt0468569,"This is by far the most overrated film ever , and this is supposed to be even number 1 on the IMDb 250 best films ever ? Better than Star Wars , American Gangster , Starship Troopers , Indiana series , Aliens to name but few ? On the basis of well-paid film promoters and their 'opinions '? Unbelieavable! What is good in Batman : it is , rightly centered on the character of Joker , and the performance of Mr Ledger is , rightly, great ,as he is portrayed as the sadistic scum , who likes to destroy , maim , generally blow up everything , not for some ideology , or , even worse , money, but for the fun of it ( He even says : I like simple things , like a stick of dynamite ), and other performances are also acceptable , but when the idea of a character Two face enters the spiel , the fun abruptly ends and falls into the philosophical abyss, consequently extending this film to the unbearable 2 h 30 minutes, ending with the , mind this , Batman as a main villain ?! Has Mr Nolan become a great fan of a modern philosophers like Zizek from Slovenia , where the most illogical and inconsequential is the norm ? Fie to this ! And visually , besides a minor 3 minutes of car chases with the Batmobile , there is virtually an empty space !Bring back Jack and T. Burton !And the famous bat dance with the Prince's tune !"
tt0361748,"Lets begin with the bad and end with the good. Inglorious Basterds plays as well as its title sounds, meaning the title embodies the entire movie. Some back country hick, and some Jews, collaborate to perform some not-so elaborate schemes of insurrection against the nazi high command. Sounds fun and appeals to audiences that want to see the nazi's completely debased, which they are to levels I have never seen in any other movie.The movie is totally one-dimensional and revolves around the general notion that ""Nazi's are bad people and they should be killed."" This is the view that many people share ever since world war 2 started and then ended. So people who cannot see the depth in the Nazi schema cannot expect to find it here.This is a feel-good movie that is meant to be fun and one exhilarating ride for today's superficial minded audience. For people who wish to find some depth or at the very least an accurate depiction of the nazi regime and its constituent functionaries, they will be completely disappointed.In the end the only rudimentary principle that this movie follows is: Dumbing down Hitler and his associates and swapping the cruelness of the Nazis with the Jews. And whatever happens afterward is OK since they ""deserve"" it. Life does not work that way and history in know way did either."
tt0313792,"Jerry Falk (Jason Biggs) is a young comedy writer who wants to write a novel and lives in New York City. After he broke with his girlfriend because of Amanda (Christina Ricci), who is messy and a pill addict, he meet David Dobel (Woody Allen) who is a comedy writer that know works as a teacher but he also is a little crazy. So the film follows the relation between this two writers and how David became like a father for Jerry that give him a lot of advices for his relationship and also for his work in their long walks in Central Park.That is the main plot of this great film written & directed by Woody Allen, who is one of the few directors that i love all of his films and that, until now, he hasn't let me down. The storyline of the film is great and have all the classic elements of a Woody Allen film: is in New York City, is a romantic comedy, there are excellent lines, there is a psychologist and there are marital problems. So it is a fact that this film is nothing new but still i found unfairly most of the critics to this film, always comparing it with Allen's masterpieces. I mean, if i have to choose between this film and ""The Purple Rose of the Cairo"" i will always choose ""The Purple Rose of the Cairo"", but that doesn't mean that the rest of the films of Woody Allen aren't good. And also is very unfairly the rating in IMDb of most of Allen's recent films like ""Scoop"", ""Melinda and Melinda"" or this one. But anyway if i see that a film of Allen is in TV i watch it, if it's in theaters i go and pay my entrance and if i missed (like this one) i go and buy the DVD, just because he has right now a very particular style that is excellent and i love it and , at lest for me, he is guarantee of a great film.Conclusion: this is a terrific film,with a good cast including Jason Biggs, Christina Ricci and Danny DeVito. With a lot of memorable lines with the classic sarcasm of Allen (always against California) and great characters, specially David Dobel with his paranoia and his crazy ideas. 9.5 out of 10PS: the Mexican title for this film is ""Muero por ti"", that means ""I Die for You"". For me is terrible and is very illogical according to the film."
tt0137523,"I'm sorry but this movie is outrageously horrible. I get the appeal but a reveal does not make the first hour and a half not horrible. The characters are outrageous to a fault, and the story is jumbled. Great reveal but does not counter out the flaws."
tt0167261,"I know, I know...everyone loves this movie.  Everyone loved the last movie too, right?  Other than myself, I have only found 2 other people that did not enjoy the first of the LOTR trilogy.  I went into the second one with high hopes - I mean, I disliked the first one to such an extent that I was SURE I would enjoy this one more.  I was right!  But just barely!With apologies to everyone who liked the film (and please remember, this is my opinion, you can have yours...), I found the film to be slightly painful. I don't know why!  I can't fathom my not liking these movies.  Maybe I found it too long.  Maybe I found the fighting scenes to be disjointed and uninspiring.  Maybe I don't like the numerous scenes involving wilted dialogue and sub-par acting.  Maybe it was the seeming attempt at making it a huge, long movie so that it would be considered an epic.  I just don't understand why I don't like the first two movies of the trilogy so far.For my money, the original Star Wars trilogy trumps this one.  Yes, that one had a lot of lame elements, in retrospect (the stupid Ewoks almost ruined it all, no?). It's lonely not liking a blockbuster movie.  I'd almost rather watch the Matrix, and believe me, I hated that movie too. Sorry!  If you liked The Two Towers, I'm happy for you!  Just don't bring me.  Please.  Please?  Please???"
tt1345836,"""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012) is the third and final film in Christopher Nolan's trilogy about the comic book superhero Batman, created in 1939 by Bill Finger and Bob Kane. The franchise, starting in 2005 with ""Batman Begins"" and continuing in ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) is brought to a conclusion, and traditional Hollywood thinking is used by the Warner Bros. Studio here: everything is bigger, louder and more explosive and with higher stakes than before. Yet this expansionism hasn't translated into greater quality; if anything, it is the most flawed of the trio. Continuity errors, plot holes and logic defying events plague the film incessantly. The screenplay, by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, feels like it is two or three drafts away from being a finished product. Geopolitical significance is constantly strived for, especially in the latter part of the film, yet it fails to fully grasp its own half-articulated ideas and ends feeling like the pat, smug ""safe"" hawkish ideologies of a studio executive more interested in profit margins than ideas. All these mistakes are a repetition of the previous entry in the series; in many ways this perfectly encapsulates Hollywood: nothing forgotten, nothing learnt.Still, Nolan's direction is as impressive as ever, really delivering in the large scale set pieces that dot the picture. He brings a real energy to the screen that almost papers over the cracks in the story. The dynamic action scenes are hardly original though and the opening sequence is straight out of a James Bond movie.The acting is generally of a high standard, with Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy all very good. Unfortunately, the Oscar winning Marion Cotillard is given nothing to do and struggles to create a performance out of a poorly written character.The cinematography by Academy Award winner Wally Pfister is good and a cut above the usual standard found in the average superhero blockbuster, the same of which can be said for the editing by Lee Smith and the booming music score of Hans Zimmer.If then this climax to the Batman series is a disappointment, torpedoed by a below par script, then at least Christopher Nolan directs so well that you will be immersed in the film to the point where perhaps you will be more forgiving of its flaws and be swept along by this enjoyable spectacle."
tt0108052,"Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end."
tt0108052,"In my opinion one of the best drama movies that i ever saw. This movie shows how people are, 99% evil, bad, cruel, and the others 1% kind, peaceful, helpful. One man can save thousands, only because ""he's a good guy"" ! This movie also shows how were the Germans when they occupied Poland"
tt0172495,"As a Roman History Buff, the ending destroyed it. You have the ending where the fictional Maximus kills Commodus (a real Roman Emperor) in gladiatorial combat. (Commodus was actually strangled in his bath when poison wasn't killing him fast enough.) The sister of Commedus, Lucilla (who had actually been executed at the beginning of Commedus' reign) announces that we are all going to honor Maximus and restore the Republic.For a Roman history buff, this is like saying World War II was Hitler giving us all Ice Cream.What actually happened was that after Commedus (who wasn't that bad of a guy, really) Rome went into an embarrassing period known as the ""Year of the Five Emperors, where a decent man was assassinated, the office of emperor was auctioned off, and three rival generals launched a civil war.This is universally agreed to be the tipping point of Rome's inevitable decline."
tt0193537,"This is an assured contemporary drama from one of the UK's hottest young directors. Gary (Paul Vaughan Evans) is dumped at his girlfriend's twenty first party, much to his surprise, and attempts to win back the love of his life. A compelling coming-of-age drama unfolds as the script ranges across moments of comedy, suspense and acute self-reflection. The largely unknown cast give uniformly excellent performances. Stunningly photographed in the Brighton summer, the City has never looked so great on film. This movie is a brave riposte to all that is regrettably vapid and fundamentally faux about so much current British film-making. a a a"
tt0133093,"Okay, okay, so the movie was mildly entertaining.  But #20 on the top 250 films of all time?  You have got to be kidding me.  If this is where the movie industry is going, I think we should all be deeply saddened.  A special effects-driven, mindless action movie with a bad script...  Hey, did Jim Cameron do this film??"
tt0805640,"VACUUM KILLER is an odd little indie from Belgium, posited as a black comedy about a man who becomes a psychopath with the aid of a modified vacuum cleaner. If it sounds weird then that's because it is, with one of the big scenes featuring a silly bathroom suicide with some cheesy special effects superimposed over the top.Other elements of this cheapie include a cat fight, a nude scene, and plenty of mannered acting that doesn't translate very well to foreign audiences. The vacuum cleaner makes for a ridiculous instrument of murder and the film is pretty silly over all, although there's plenty going on so at least it's never boring."
tt0109830,"The most dishonest, hypocritical movie ever made.  It disguises its right-wing political message by using Gump to cover up its commentary on the 60s--which is profoundly nasty and negative.  He is a hero because he can ignore all the social evils around him--is that not a commentary?  I understand that the moviemakers denied they were trying to send a message. They lie.  I'll take my political propaganda straight, please."
tt1853728,In typical Tarantino fashion.. this movie is a long build up to an exciting finish. His directing skills and creativity are exceptional but at times can take away from the film. Things are over dramatized and exaggerated which is fun and different but at times are annoying and boring. Overall it's a one of a kind movie which sets it apart for the rest
tt1130884,"Martin Scorsese is in my opinion the greatest living movie maker . He started off during the New Hollywood era in the late 1960s and is described as a "" movie brat "" , a film maker who was brought up on a fine diet of cinema during his formative years and it shows . He is very much an aficionado of cinema and this in depth knowledge shows in SHUTTER ISLANDThe story itself is somewhat similar to the works of Val Lewton and Scorsese shows his influences and he builds upon the tension . He's on record as saying he's been a big fan of British cinema and anyone who remembers the opening shot of ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE will have noticed a similarity to the great British director Michael Powell . Throughout the running time the cinematography emulates the glorious rich and lurid look of a Powell film whilst Scorsese adds grotesque imagery of his own . Even if you're not overwhelmed by the story there';s still much to admire about the movie!!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!!Alas the problem with the movie is that it's constructed around a plot involving a twist ending . Scorsese has never been a director who makes plot driven movies , he makes character driven ones but the faults of the film are down to either screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis or even the original source novel by Dennis Lehane . There's two ways the film will end . One that is similar to SHOCK CORRIDOR - the One I was hoping for - or the one we did get which was the one I hoped we wouldn't get . Scorsese deliberately uses unrealistic mis-en-scene on occasions that shows where the movie is heading but even if he didn't you'll still manage to work things out for yourself There is a telling question the film poses at the end if it's better to live as a monster or to die as a good man ? but this isn't enough to rescue the pay off . Worse still the screenplay has an overlong sequence where the plot is spoon-fed to the audience as if they've been in a coma for two hours . INCEPTION is another film that felt the need to explain its plot mechanics . One worries that in the future we'll be seeing a film directed by Michael Bay where characters have to explain what explosions and loud noises areAll in all SHUTTER ISLAND is something of a disappointment as has much of the director's work in the 21st Century . Movies like THE AVIATOR do improve on second viewing since they're character driven . The problem with having a high concept plot is that once the cat is let out of the bag it stays out of the bag . That said it is remains a highly impressive film on a visual level and posing the question of "" Is it better to die as a good man than live as a monster ? "" is consistent in keeping with Scorsese's running theme of existentialist angst in most of his work ."
tt0914805,"With a few exceptions, most horror films are scary but there's a certain unreality to them. You watch them and jump when you're meant to jump and you scream when you're meant to scream, but at the same time you're thinking that this could never happen to you.Head Case is different. The way it's filmed as to be edited from home movies certainly helps to make it seem realistic, but even more so it's the way the characters act and interact. So many of the exchanges between the husband and wife are just so ... ordinary. Their bickering tends to be rather boring, something you've heard a thousand times from listening to your dull neighbors. At times I began to tune them out. However, when they're planning or carrying out their horrific murders, they're just as casual about it! The way they can nonchalantly describe to each other the way a woman is chewing up ground glass or how it's so difficult to saw through a spine, as though they're doing nothing more than talking about the weather, is what makes this film so absolutely chilling.This film being so realistic, it has to be one of the most horrifying I have ever seen. I will never again accept a car ride or a glass of ginger ale."
tt0993846,"It's unfortunate; I came into this movie with such high expectations that was sustained through the first 30 min of the movie, crashing right after in similar fashion to the stock market crash of the early 80s.You see, it's very similar to Goodfellas in it's narrative format. That aside, the movie is loosely tied by a plot reminiscent of Casino, holding together episodes of pointless bantering and ridiculous debauchery. The debaucherous episodes are fun, but the gratuitous sex and drug scenes honestly get tiring after awhile, since it seems they ran out of any compelling plot points.I expected Jonah Hill to be a little funnier. I sighed every time Leo was about to give a speech, I could see himself trying to hearken to Gordon Gekko's style of speech yet with a veinier more expletive filled delivery. Leo gave too many speeches. He hammed it up unnecessarily. At one point he went Daniel Day Lewis level type retarded and it became very clear this was the most disappointing ""try hard"" attempt for an Oscar I had seen outside of ""I am Sam""."
tt0139414,"The not-so-witty bon mots are flying in this pathetic attempt to make a laugh a minute giant crocodile movie. David E. Kelley's idea of creativity is to give crotchety old lady Betty White a pottymouth (""if I had a dick, this is when I'd tell you to suck it""). An embaressment for all involved, including Brendan Gleeson and the normally reliable Oliver Platt."
tt0068646,"Some people have called this one of the best movies of all time. I can see why they say that, although I wouldn't quite rate it that high. It does feature an interesting storyline, great acting and magnificent photography so I am not going to argue with those who place in so high, because it's understandable. It also has a memorable score.One needs to see this on a nice widescreen DVD because it's so beautifully photographed with tons of greens, grays and browns that are just beautiful. It makes me want to visit Italy. The only reason I personally didn't rate it as high as others was I didn't like any of the characters, and especially the hot-headed James Caan. When he got riddled with bullets and was done with, a la ""Bonnie & Clyde,"" that was fine with me!There isn't as much violence as people might think, if they've never seen this movie. To some, this film might be too slow, in fact. However, when the violence or something dramatic occurs it is intense and can be very brutal. Who can ever forget a guy waking up with a dead, bloody horse in his bed?!!Like a good film noir, there is a lot of tension running throughout the Godfather films. Everybody is after somebody it seems and you never know whom to trust. That's part of the downsides of living a criminal life: constant paranoia. All this is put together nicely as we become close observers of the Corleone family, its family ties and its ""business.""Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Caan, Robert DeNiro (later in the saga), Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, John Cazale, Richard Castellano, on and on - quite a cast and quite a movie. I enjoyed both sequels, too.I am also fortunate to own ""The Godfather Epic"" on tape, which must be some sort of collector's item by now. It is three two-hour tapes in which Godfather I and II are sliced together and the story is presented in chronological order, instead of with all the flashbacks. It's well-done and I would have printed a review on that version, but I don't see it listed on IMDb."
tt1130884,"I'm actually very surprised at the number of favorable reviews attached to this movie. Perhaps, my expectations were a tad too high before walking into the theater, but it's difficult not to expect a phenomenal film with Scorsese at the helm. I must admit, my problem with the movie is based solely on the actual story line, since I am able to recognize that the cinematography and Scorsese's ""Hitchcockian"" approach to the film are definitely its highlights. If you and I have anything in common, initially, you base whether or not you like a film on the script, the actual story being told, with the director's vision, their angle for telling the story, following close behind. Long story short, while I was able to see the positives while watching Shutter Island (the acting and the film's direction will not disappoint), I found the film to be predictable and just simply, nothing special at all."
tt0110912,"Saw this at the cinema as a rerelease despite having seen it many times it's still worth a watch on the big screen.One thing I love about this film is you always notice something new, tonight I learned Steve Buscemi is it!Still brilliant and still worth a few hours of anyone's time"
tt7286456,"I had been very excited to see this movie ever since I had 1st heard about it, and was anticipating its release.But when it started getting the type of hype and press that it was, I became a bit apprehensive, as the things that were being said about it, which seemed outrageous, mostly, were things that were said about other moves I had been looking forward to seeing, and that had ended letting me down.The Joker, sadly, turned out to be one of those movies for me.Now, as I know it has been said many times before, Phoenix's portrayal of man with mental health & depression was very very good & convincing.But the story and the plot seemed like a big missed opportunity to deliver an anti hero origin story of one of the most coveted villains in comic book lore.I liked the quasi mirroring of a failed system whose middle & lower class revolt against the rich, in a sort of ""if we burn, you burn with us"" type of way that has been done many times before.I'm sure people can see glimpses of that today in our US culture.And who knows, maybe the studio execs got their fingers involved, and are the ones that watered it down a bit too much.Maybe there will be a directors cut that is darker than the theatrical release.I certainly hope so.Because for all the reviews I have read that speak of people walking out of theaters because of the dark feel and psychological overtones being too much for them to stomach; all I felt was a sense of wanting it to be bigger and grander than what I was seeing.I would recommend seeing this movie so that you can formulate your own opinion, but I gave it a low rating, because when it was over, I walked out feeling like I just saw a movie I've already seen many times before."
tt0114369,"In 2004, the movie ""Saw"" vaulted to the top of many ""psychological thriller"" lists via its gritty depiction of violence and insights into the criminal mind. Nearly ten years earlier, ""Se7en"" covered similar material and, barring one slip-up, could have stolen Saw's thunder.For a basic plot summary, ""Se7en"" focuses on a series of brutal crimes revolving around the seven deadly sins of religious lore. Investigators Mills (Brad Pitt) & Somerset (Morgan Freeman) are assigned to the case, each bringing a unique perspective (in keeping with their general film personas) to the strange murders. As they near the end of the case, the detectives discover that the man they are pursuing has ideas about human nature that, while sadistic, might just cut to the core of what makes us all fallible.There are two reasons why this movie works as well as it does...First, the overall storyline is just very well-crafted. Director David Fincher has proved time and time again that he knows how to construct a solid motion picture, and this one is no different. By the end of the movie, you'll be questioning your very beliefs on what you just saw, making this a very cerebral experience.Also, Fincher does not shy away from portraying the re-enactments of the seven deadly sins in their graphic detail. Some people would probably view this as overkill or gross-out film-making, but Fincher realized that it HAD to be this way for such a dark, gritty film to work.In terms of acting, Pitt & Freeman turn in their usual solid performances. The character arcs seemed a bit forced (Pitt as the ""eager rookie"", Freeman as the ""grizzled vet""), but the physical acting itself (as well as the way it all comes together in the end) more than makes up for that.The only reason I can't give this film a full five stars (and also the same reason why I can't say it is as good as Saw)? To me, the real ""meat"" of the story is when the two detectives finally confront the villain (played to perfection by Kevin Spacey). Whereas in Saw, the ""Jigsaw"" killer is given as much backstory & screen time as the protagonists, ""Se7en"" only focuses on Spacey's character for the last portion of the film. Everything leading up the that is a procedural cop story (albeit a graphic & disturbing one).Thus, I consider ""Se7en"" to be a groundbreaking effort in the psychological thriller department, paving the way for later efforts like ""Saw"". It isn't perfect, but it did (at least at the time) tread new ground. Unless you are overly squeamish, this movie will keep you engaged from its shocking beginning to its even more shocking finale!"
tt0102926,"What is so special about this film? I've watched it once, about a year ago, and could never figure it out myself. What I saw was a pretty good thriller which bombed out at the very end. I never thought the acting was all that great either. I think Anthony Hopkins was overacting, and I thought it was one of Jodie Foster's slightest performances. She had a more complex character in Freaky Friday.Oh, and the end that I mentioned above (I guess SPOILERS):Jodie Foster just stumbles on Buffalo Bob while following her clues. It seemed believable to me that she might come upon him before she actually new exactly who she was confronting. But it also made the film seem rushed to actually have the final showdown as soon as she accidentally runs into Buffalo Bob. It almost seemed to me as if they decided that the movie was too long at that point, and that they should just let this coincidence develop into a finale, even if it was premature. If you don't understand what I am talking about, that is, if you thought the film ended at the correct time, read Roger Ebert's review of the film. I did not develop my opinion from his review either, he  just confirmed my suspicions. I don't think Silence of the Lambs was particularly fascinating elsewhere, but it was often entertaining. I would have given it a 7/10, but the sloppy ending knocks it down to a 6/10. Jesus, how did the Academy remember this at awards time. 1992 must have been a slow year."
tt0109830,"I'm an action movie guy. Primarily, I like it when things blow up. So to begin with, ""Forrest Gump"" was not going to be my kind of movie. But I like an intelligent film that has something to say, and I think I ""get it"" about this film. It's a journey through modern American history, showing a window into mainstream culture from the plight of the main character.Unfortunately, the film is incredibly sappy. Everybody who can possibly get hurt gets hurt. If it's a sunny day, it will start raining in this film. Then we get to linger on this melancholy in endless melodramatic scenes. Meanwhile Forrest, who is stupid as a stump (unlike brilliant actor Tom Hanks who plays him) is an anti-hero who lets others push him around. There's no deep theme, and the movie is sub-intellectual.These things built up into what is essentially an amateur script surrounded by a blockbuster hype and star cast. ""Forrest Gump"" is basically a soap opera, and I do mean to conjure images of daytime TV at its worst.Who should see this film:-- Soap opera fans-- Everybody else, run for the hills -- even if you do havean artistic film school depthI'll give ""Forrest Gump"" a 2 out of 10, because it at least maintained a consistent tone throughout. If you don't like the first ten minutes, stop watching."
tt0108052,"The movies should inspire, and provide a view of things the way they ought to be.  Schindler is both.  This is probably the most difficult movie you will ever watch.  The liquidation of the ghetto, for instance, or the shower scene, are among the most heartbreaking images ever filmed.  Yet this movie might cause you to rethink the meaning of egoism when you see it manifested in this enigmatic man."
tt0480025,"First off, this movie is great simply because it starts off with Toots & the Maytals' ""54-46 Was My Number"". Dig it out on Utube and play it about 500 times and you still can't get it out of your head. My Samoan buddy Etene Fau used to play this song when he was in the Bay area but I had never heard the original. Man does this bring back good memories. Anyway, after playing Toots & the Maytals' ""54-46 Was My Number"" 500 times you can work in Nina Simone's Sinnerman about 50 times and you will be ready to watch this depressing and slightly amateurish movie. OK, it is supposedly autobiographical, so I guess the writer/director is trying to apologize for being a Nazi skinhead when he grew up. He does this by trying to blame his peers and environment and mommy. This does indeed show he has become a true liberal, blaming his shortcomings on others. It was society's fault he was an stupid kid.In addition to trying to show he was just a cute little kid that was unduly influenced by every weirdo street hobo he ran across, the movie tries to make some big sweeping comments about war and hate. This comes off so amateurish as to be infantile. As a coming-of-age movie I guess it was politically correct, after all the kid does reject the skinhead movement after he sees violence first-hand. The problem is, this is the exact wrong point. The fact of the matter is that the hate and senseless violence fueled some change and that is the point-- the elite will not give up their cushy sinecures just because it is the right thing to do. You have to beat it out of them. This has been true for 500.000 years of human development and it is not going to change soon. You can make the exact same movie and substitute Black Panthers for skinheads. Just flip the skin color of everybody in the movie. The Panthers were unjust self-serving a$$holes just like the skinheads. But I tell you what, if it wasn't for the Panthers, Martin Luther King would have gotten nowhere. The only reason the American political elite accepted civil rights was because it was less painful than a bullet in the forehead. So the stupid ideology and pathetic racism of the skinheads was not the point. The whole movie should have been examined how humans form political and economic bonds, and especially how we trump up religion in order to go attack and kill a bunch of other humans and take their stuff. You can poutch out your lips and make tsk tsk sounds all you want. You are living in a house or flat that people exactly like the skinheads or the Black Panthers took from some other group. Maybe it was American Indians, maybe it was Celts or Normans or whatever gang-of-the week was occupying England at the time. We all love to eat the tasty burger, nobody wants to drive the iron rod into the cow's head and cut up dear ol' Elsie so we can fire up the Bar-B-Q. We all love living in ""our"" houses, as long as idiots like Combo or Malcolm X or Joan of Arc or Osama Bin Laden do the dirty work and take it from someone else, or at least the land that it stands on. This was an interesting movie but for the opposite reason the director intended. He had the same problem as Terry Gilliam in Brazil, making a bleak and horrid subject entertaining. But when you look at this movie as a documentary it is perfectly satisfying. In that view the ending is very sad, since we see that the little boy is really a pansy with no loyalty or convictions and without the stomach to really fight for any belief. The movie should end like that Geico commercial with R Lee Ermey calling him a jackwagon and throwing a tissue box at him.OK, I am clowning a bit and being too hard on the director. But think about what this teaches us about history. How the Persian empire was built across racial bounds. As long as you accepted Islam you could be a general. Before that, Alexander the great would not kill the defender of a city he attacked as long as the guy was out front fighting his butt off. Meritocracy trumping race or creed. We can see how the moral base for forming alliances and then stealing from your fellow man has changed from family to clan to city-state to religion, where finally race does not matter,-- to what? What will be next? I assume some BS imperialism like the USA where we shout freedom! freedom! freedom!, drop the bombs, set up the puppet, and pump out the oil. And so I any less of a hypocrite than this film when I shout objections to our wars and then go gas up my Honda for 3 bucks a gallon? Mmmmm that's a tasty burger.Oh yeah, major kudos to all the actors-- the guy that played Combo was way better than Russell Crowe in his skinhead dork movie. The kid was excellent and so were all the other players. They were so strong that I did not even notice if there were deficiencies in camera or lighting or set decoration. When the movie is over you find yourself elated and happy without bounds when you realize you do not know any people like this."
tt1375666,"You only get to watch this for the first time once, so choose your state of mind carefully.
It is a film about movies and dreams and reality, and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter.
It is spectacular, and brutal, and enigmatic and disturbing.
It is beautiful and absorbing.
It is about one of my favourite characters ever to grace the screen.
I don't see it often, in case it's not as good as I like to remember it.
That is my secret, that I lock away in my safe in the basement.
That somewhere there is a perfect world for us all.
For some, perhaps it is in the cinema watching this."
tt0372784,"Prior to watching Batman Begins i had my doubts. However, they were dispersed in that movie theater. This is a great reboot of the franchise. I particularly like the way it had been made realistic and closer to reality.Of course, we still stay in the realm of fiction, but Batman's gear and vehicles are just a step beyond what you'd see in a typical action flick, even a James Bind movie.The layer that elevates Batman Begins from your average comic book hero is a vague social message. Yet, i didn't think much about it and proceeded watching Bruce Wayne dealing with the bad guys."
tt0167261,"The only redeeming quality of this film was the epic battle sequences.  A pornography of violence is the only thing that saved this film from being terribly boring.The characters were very flat.  Interaction between them was predictable (predictable, even without having read the books).  For example, the undeveloped subplot between Aragorn and that princess was cliche.  From the moment a hint of her liking him came out, I could see what was going to happen.The only interesting character was Golum.  He symbolized the external battle for good and evil through an internal struggle.The dialogue in this movie offered nothing.  It was mostly about one group's plans, followed by the enemies plans.Well.  I don't want to think much more about this movie.  I think it was terrible.  The fighting scenes and animation were cool.  Perhaps the ""acting"" parts should be cut and the remaining scenes should be edited as cut scenes into a video game or something, because this definately doesn't stand as a film on its own."
tt0114369,"Seven's quality puts it so far beyond most of the ""cops on trail of deranged killer"" genre that it comes out as a true jewel of cinema. Everything about seven is perfect. It is art captured on film. This movie is a bright spot for all of the stars who worked on it.Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he's a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing. That's a shame because he is a talented actor that isn't afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays. That is quite rare in the A-list world. Morgan Freeman is a great actor. You can always count on him to do what he does best which is play a wise veteran that has seen it all. Kevin Spacey is another great actor that has great range and really puts life and personality into his characters.The real talent of this movie, excluding the actors that brought it to life, is the director David Fincher and the writer Andrew Kevin Walker. Fincher's talents for making a visually stunning film are now well known and he often brings a dark patina to his work. Andrew Kevin Walker must have some incredible demons living inside him. Either that or one hell of an imagination for bringing the intricate story of Seven and the plan of John Doe to life.John Doe's plan really is twisted and I won't be spoiling it here. Suffice to say I have never seen so evil and complicated a plan in a movie before or since. The cinematography of the film is dark but beautiful and throughout the film it is either night or raining or both except for two very brief moments. It is such an emotional movie that you can't keep from being caught up in what is happening. Do you understand and sympathize with what John Doe is doing or do you think him a mad killer that must be stopped.Bottom Line: If you haven't had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it. It is so damn good that I know you will like it. The only reason you wouldn't is because you're just too damn fragile to take something this hardcore."
tt0167260,"Ok, the first one was cool. The second lost it in the middle... But 11 oscars for the third????? ""Just shoot me"" I would NEVER have  given them one! No-no-no, to be nice to Peter J., I will say, that from Bad Taste to Lotr - A great achievement. Cool scenes, very computerish. No ketchup used? But the book was lost as the Ring itself. I am so sorry to announce, that the battle scenes were all the movie was. Nothing else, really; while the book is actually about life, love and bringing light to the dark places. Oh well, adaptation.... Cool Gollum thou. His appearence almost saved the movie, but then there was FRODO...... Weird, in the book he grows stronger thru adventures, but in the movie - gets more and more like a whining cat. BIG MISTAKE. Sorry. All in all a cute enough time-amusement, but.... The Oscar goes to.....???"
tt0133093,"1959 saw one of cinema's greatest achievements, 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'. Widely regarded as the worst film of all time, it featured a plot unrivalled in absurdity.Then came 'The Matrix'. Apparently robots (or space zombies, or some variety of scary CGI monsters) have enslaved humanity, and are harvesting them for energy. To keep their living batteries entertained the robo-zombies (or space alligators, it doesn't really matter) have created a giant computer game called 'the Matrix'. With a devil-may-care disregard for the first law of thermodynamics, this game runs on the energy of the people it simulates.But some of these people break out of the computer game and live in a rusty metal bucket and eat gruel. Being heroes, they plan to overthrow their demon-squid robot overlords and free humanity, so they can all live in rusty metal buckets and eat gruel. There are some philosophical pretensions and religious references in there, but these are too simplistic and crass to be worth going any deeper into.Keanu Reeves gives a very believable performance of bad acting, while the rest of the cast mince around in sunglasses and trench-coats, delivering dialogue which serves no other purpose than carrying the plot.The first fifteen minutes of this film are quite watchable, which is why I am giving it a generous two out of ten."
tt0361748,"I must admit when I saw the preview for ""Inglorious Basterds"" I gave myself big expectations. THIS FILM DID NOT Disappoint.Rarely when I watch a movie with such high-expectations do I have those expectations met or exceeded; this film did that and more. Even more rarely do I clap at the end of a movie, this I and everyone else in the theater did.I have to say I am a little biased towards Quentin, I grew up with ""Pulp Fiction."" I watched it when I was 12 and it is still my favorite and most influential film.However, since then Quentin has not really lived up to his billing. His style was getting a little predictable instead of familiar, the quality honestly wasn't there (I never watched Jackie Brown, and then there's Grindhouse). That is until ""Inglorious Basterds."" What Quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre, a spaghetti western feel that could only be done by Tarantino or Sergio Leone, but seeing how Leone is dead, Tarantino's the self appointed guy on this masterpiece.So let's look at the movie which I won't give away. The writing was spot on, a beautiful transition between using not one but four different languages in this movie. Not to mention this movie was set up in the classic Tarantino mold, great scenes of rich meaningful dialog and sudden shocking action.The acting was superb!! Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar, seriously. I don't say that often, but honestly the man should get one for this movie, he spoke every language in this movie, and delivered with such amazing touch and poise. He stole the show in a movie that everybody was amazingly impressive.I have no problem building this movie up, because this movie is the best film I've seen all year, and probably all of next year. Quite frankly the more I think about it, this movie may crack my top films of all time, and is Quentin's best movie since ""Pulp Fiction."" Take it from me, watch this film. I loved it doesn't do this movie enough justice.I watched it yesterday and I'm still blown away. Thank you Quentin from the bottom of my heart for you making this movie. You're back on top again buddy. I can't say enough for ""Inglorious Basterds!"""
tt0111161,"Idk what kinda sick freaks yall are to suffer through this and rate it highly for your time. I honestly wondered about this all through witnessing the horrors upon horrors this movie dished up for me, hoping against hope that it would get better at some point.My conclusion is that people who rate this highly probably don't feel much of anything in real life and need something graphic and excruciating to make them feel good about themselves and their life. Or perhaps to understand and have a modicum of compassion for the millions of people that get locked away out there.Personally, I didn't need any of this on my free Monday night. I already knew we shouldn't handle criminals like some of you do, and I already have a low opinion of the world.Freaking 9.3 as of writing this. SmdhNow, the irony of my review isn't lost on me. I get that the moral of the movie was exactly the kind of thing I lacked in watching it: hope and perseverance. But doesn't that mean the movie failed to deliver just that?Gave one extra star for the lights in the main characters' eyes. Turned the movie off when they shot that poor kid. The set up was clear and I wasn't surprised, but it was still the last damn straw.For any of you enjoying this sort of story, may I suggest another classic? It's called: Les Miserables.Trust me, you're gonna love it."
tt0120737,"I like the first movie of the trilogy the best, especially the extended cut. The Balrog was awesome, and as a whole it captured the feel of the book. I missed the Old Forest, Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Downs, though. Both as events in themselves, but also the mythological value that part of the book adds. Saruman was terrific. 8/10.The second was the worst of the three, with the extended cut recapturing only a bit of the lost ground. Theoden was indifferent and Eowyn was downright awful. Gollum, though, was amazing and Saruman was once again terrific. 5/10.The third was a slight improvement over the second, again with the extended cut being better the than the original cut. It had some very bad passages, though. Paths of the Dead, The Dead Army and Denethor was terrible, and so was the grotesque orc leading the assault on Minas Tirith. Also, that Peter Jackson chose to omit the Witch King riding up to the gates of Minas Tirith, one of the most powerful scenes of the book, is just unforgivable. 6/10Overall, Peter Jackson misses the mark by quite a bit. He transforms Gimli into a comic sidekick and Legolas into a pretty boy surfer dude. His depiction of the orcs is just so off target. They should die in droves at the sieges of Helm's Deep and Minas Tirith, as the undisciplined rabble they are, their numbers and their savagery being the threat, not their fighting prowess.The work as a whole lacks any connection to Tolkien's mythology and that is the greatest sin of them all."
tt1375666,"Inception is an interesting movie, however I did not enjoy it. I go the movies to be entertained, to be transported into the movie, to be involved and have my emotions stirred. Inception did none of that, it failed because it focused on the creativity but forgot about the audience. Credit must be given to the special effects, the acting and the creative content, but the praise stops there.I have read a lot of the reviews here and I have to say I'm very surprised, I simply don't agree with the high rating this movie has been awarded with. If you would like to watch an interesting, creative and action packed movie, this will not disappoint. For me, there were too many implausible (bordering on ridiculous) twists to enable me to enjoy it.The technical aspects surrounding the connectivity between the participants was just nonsense, there was little explanation, little offered on how it worked and why. Clearly someone thought the audience would just let that part slide and not be too fussed about the technicalities.This is a selfish movie, its been written, produced and directed to be creative, amazing and intelligent.. the problem is someone forgot about the audience. I for one was not engaged, transported nor were my emotions stirred..apart from feeling annoyed and disappointed.I expected so much more from this movie.."
tt0816692,"There is not even a single day I don't think of this movie, it's scenes , it has a profound impact on me and it shall remain with me forever."
tt0993846,"I have to confess that I was really looking forward to seeing this movie on the back of a lot of critical acclaim. Personally I found it somewhat of a disappointment!The film tells the story of Jordan Belfort(DiCaprio) who was a Wall Street stockbroker. He was not satisfied with the amount of money that could be made through legitimate trades, so he he used illegal methods to make more money. It follows a lot of the themes familiar from Wall Street, but focuses on the lifestyle that Jordan leads.For me the film was a little too long and completely ignored the consequences of Jordan's actions. It would have been interesting to see the effects that his actions had on other people and I'm quite sure in real life he would have had a few confrontations with people he swindled. There is no doubt that DiCaprio gives a great performance in the lead role and the film certainly made me consider whether happiness and money have any relationship whatsoever. It could be argued that watching the film may well lead people to the conclusion that money and happiness are inversely proportional. I guess you can't really argue with a film that leaves you with that feeling!"
tt0120737,"The hype surrounding this film is unbeliveable, everyone who eighter has seen it or just read about it in internet rushes to proclaim that it is the best movie ever. Still the movie is flawed beyond belief, the spirit of the books has been completely forgotten emphasis is given to action and thriller sequences.So you keep telling me the movie is almost or completely flawless, let me point out some ""minor"" errors.First in the story, book vs. movie starting from the beginning Frodo did not read a book in the tree, Frodo didn't ride Gandalfs wagon, Gandalf didn't bump his head in Bag End, Rosie was not a barmaid, there was a tent Bilbo's birthday, Merry and Pippin didn't make pranks, Gandalf provided some effects at Bilbos dissapearance, Bilbo didn't drop the ring, Farmer Maggot grew mushrooms not carrots, etc etc etc, I could make this list a couple of pages long, while some ""alterations"" are of no importance some drastic things are also changed eg. the fight between Gandalf & Saruman, Strider carries another sword than narsil, Strider just happens to carry suitable magic swords for hobbits, Boromir holds ring at caradhras, Aragorn battles orcs at Amon Hen, Frodo talks to Aragorn about parting the fellowship ...I mean the timeline is completely lost, all possible is done to make action more intense, there are orcs that climb the walls of moria like spiders............And you dare call this faithful ? not by a long shot, sorry.The fight scenes are awful, they look like something from the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with the ill timed zooms & slow motion...Those pepole who call this the best movie ever, or even of the year are yet to see a good movie then, or are at their early teens.It is a quite nice action / adventure yes, but it is also just a popcorn movie that has taken a brilliant story and turned and twisted it untill it's almost pure action, no character developement and most of all no spirit, nothing that would make think about anything, nothing that would change your views of the world, it's just a action movie, nothing more, nothing less.I am so dissapointed"
tt1130884,"Where do I start with a movie which is so bad from every possible angle? What is happening to cinema these days? We have one of the supposedly greatest directors, a bunch of superstar actors and an unlimited budget to make a movie. And what comes out is complete garbage, making no sense. To top it all, the movie is on the top 250 list in IMDb. Maybe a chunk the money was spent on creating a secret network all over the world on people casting a high grade on IMDb, so the movie would not come out with 3 on average. In fact, I am quite sure it was done that way. Or maybe I am delirious and should be put into an asylum? At least that is not as bad has having to suffer this movie again."
tt1130884,"Martin Scorsese is in my opinion the greatest living movie maker . He started off during the New Hollywood era in the late 1960s and is described as a "" movie brat "" , a film maker who was brought up on a fine diet of cinema during his formative years and it shows . He is very much an aficionado of cinema and this in depth knowledge shows in SHUTTER ISLANDThe story itself is somewhat similar to the works of Val Lewton and Scorsese shows his influences and he builds upon the tension . He's on record as saying he's been a big fan of British cinema and anyone who remembers the opening shot of ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE will have noticed a similarity to the great British director Michael Powell . Throughout the running time the cinematography emulates the glorious rich and lurid look of a Powell film whilst Scorsese adds grotesque imagery of his own . Even if you're not overwhelmed by the story there';s still much to admire about the movie!!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!!Alas the problem with the movie is that it's constructed around a plot involving a twist ending . Scorsese has never been a director who makes plot driven movies , he makes character driven ones but the faults of the film are down to either screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis or even the original source novel by Dennis Lehane . There's two ways the film will end . One that is similar to SHOCK CORRIDOR - the One I was hoping for - or the one we did get which was the one I hoped we wouldn't get . Scorsese deliberately uses unrealistic mis-en-scene on occasions that shows where the movie is heading but even if he didn't you'll still manage to work things out for yourself There is a telling question the film poses at the end if it's better to live as a monster or to die as a good man ? but this isn't enough to rescue the pay off . Worse still the screenplay has an overlong sequence where the plot is spoon-fed to the audience as if they've been in a coma for two hours . INCEPTION is another film that felt the need to explain its plot mechanics . One worries that in the future we'll be seeing a film directed by Michael Bay where characters have to explain what explosions and loud noises areAll in all SHUTTER ISLAND is something of a disappointment as has much of the director's work in the 21st Century . Movies like THE AVIATOR do improve on second viewing since they're character driven . The problem with having a high concept plot is that once the cat is let out of the bag it stays out of the bag . That said it is remains a highly impressive film on a visual level and posing the question of "" Is it better to die as a good man than live as a monster ? "" is consistent in keeping with Scorsese's running theme of existentialist angst in most of his work ."
tt0372784,"I finally saw BB and was expecting great things from the reviews it received last summer. While not a bad film, it didn't have that dynamite punch you expect from a film touted as a summer blockbuster. I found the very beginning confusing and it took me 40 minutes in till I started finding it entertaining and not boring. The beginning is from the title, it shows how Bruce Wayne trained to become a deadly fighter with a secret organization. He goes back to Gothem after being gone years to rid the city of crime. Rachel, the girl he had a crush on, is an assistant DA and one of the few that has not been bought by the mob. The movie shows how Bruce developed the bat suit, mobile,and weapons. And of course he must battle the surprise (though he was gone/dead) villains at the end who want to destroy Gotham with a chemical that makes people crazy.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but not that great story you need to be a big hit. Spiderman was much better with how they showed the hero obtaining super hero moves."
tt0246262,"A very good portrayal of the theme
'We must work hard and be always down to earth irrespective of our financial status'.
Swayamkrushi is a timeless classic delivered by our finest director K. Vishwanath. Chiranjeevi's performance is top notch. Vijayashanti and the rest of the casting is good. Music is okay."
tt0468569,"Yes, Joker was really great, but overall this movie was a total letdown.A few totally stupid things that killed this movie for me.*Spoilers*Joker blows up a freaking HOSPITAL in BROAD freaking DAYLIGHT and makes his escape in an ultra fast SCHOOL BUS, which no cop seems able to stop, even though they've been warned that Joker will, you know, blow up a hospital. You see, this is totally believable because the cops apparently set up a perimeter two freaking miles away, just to be safe. It's not like they could have used a helicopter or something for surveillance. That would just make too much sense (sarcasm).Batman falls several stories to the ground, not once, but TWICE and gets up without so much as a broken bone, but hey, that's okay because his super duper special armor, (which is so strong that a dog can chew through it) protected him from the fall. That's totally realistic! Right? What's that you say? The metal roof of the Taxi totally cushioned his fall. Well, that's even BETTER! How wonderfully realistic. If I ever have to jump out of a burning building it's nice to know that a kevlar vest and a strategically placed car will break my fall.Police Commissioner Gordon pretends to be dead so that Joker will chase after Harvey Dent instead of his family (huh?) and Joker proceeds to kill six innocent people in the middle of downtown Chicago, uh, Gotham City, but this is okay, because by drawing the Joker out, the police are protecting the public from harm. No reason to clear the streets of pedestrians and traffic and stuff while transporting Harvey Dent as bait for a sicko maniac killer.Joker manages to keep a pencil perfectly balanced on a table while a large gangster stomps across the floor to fight him. Cool, but stupid.Joker burns a pyramid of money, because you see, money is not important to him. What's important to him is blowing and burning stuff up, which is exactly why he robs banks for a living. Makes perfect sense, no?Batman speaks with an annoying rasp which hides his Bruce Wayne voice because as everyone knows, Christopher Nolan wants this to be a REALISTIC depiction of Batman, which is why we have sonar cell phones in this movie and magic armor and explosive laced Bat Mobiles that turn into motorcycles which do gravity defying 360 turns on walls.Other complaints: There was no Wayne Manor in this film. No Bat cave. Chicago looks a bit too bright and modern to be Gotham City. Seriously, what is Gotham City without, you know, Gothic architecture? The girl playing Rachel Dawes is completely ugly, but for some reason Bruce Wayne is so obsessed with her that he decides to have sex with the whole Gotham City ballet, just so she can't go on a date with Harvey Dent.I know lots of people got drawn into the hype of seeing Heath Ledger's last great performance, but besides Joker, there is no redeeming value in this film. There's no iconic battles. No real hero to root for (seriously, you will hate Batman in this movie).Christopher Nolan gets a special mention for trying to inject at least some intelligence into a summer blockbuster, but there was just one too many stupid things to justify the price of admission. If you haven't seen this film, just wait for it on DVD."
tt0109830,"many people love this movie,some even calling it a work of art.however,i must respectfully disagree.i found the movie uninspiring,at best,at mostly one long bore.if you like your movies heavy on sap,you will like this movie.this movie at times felt like one long ""i'm okay, your okay,we're all okay""inspirational speech.if i want motivational advice,i'll go see Anthony Robbins or some other guru. all kidding aside other than the film's heavy handedness,there are a few good thing about it.the acting was good,the special effects were decent.the best thing about the movie,however is its 1960's and 70's soundtrack.despite it good points,the movie is not worth recommending. 3/10"

tt1345836,"I decided to write a re-review of The Dark Knight Rises because after seeing it a third time, you lose the hype, you lost the excitement because that is all done with. You can really focus on the movie, and I felt like I was never able to do that with the first review I wrote. I would probably have to say this is at least my second favorite Batman movie-- after Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight following closely at number three. You never realize the first go around, while TDKR is drastically different than BB & TDK in terms of it's style, it's that style that sets it apart from any of the previous entries.You get subtle hints to the grand picture of it all through tidbits throughout TDKR. A lot of people have different beliefs, whether or not Alfred was imagining Bruce near the end of the movie, but I believe it was a real vision. Bruce was finally happy, and left his old life behind. I also believe it is real because Alfred never was aware of Bruce and Selina growing fond for each other towards the end of the movie, and she was sitting next to Bruce at the diner. Bruce Wayne is ""dead"" but not the Batman. It is emotionally satisfying because now you see Bruce a character you cared for, finally have a life worth living. He's at peace.I ultimately believe Blake becomes Batman, for one the Bat signal is repaired. Bruce gives him the coordinates to the Batcave. And for all you Batman fanatics, remember in Batman Begins, Bruce told Alfred after being gone for seven years, ""As a man I can be destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be everlasting. I could be incorruptible"", or something a long those lines, and I look at that and tie it in with John Blake's character of indeed becoming Batman.Some of those points I mentioned is what makes TDKR such a joy to watch. So thoughtful, and emotionally engaging. Nolan definitely did give justice to the franchise. When I first seen it I felt like it was the least favorite of mine but still enjoyable-- but now I'd have to say it is my second favorite out of all the three, maybe even my favorite one in the trilogy!9.0/10"
tt0172495,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.I didn't know man could build such things.Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10"
tt1853728,"A new Tarantino movie, sounds great!Sorry people, where do all the good reviews come from??I see the point, this movie is also created to make a point of how wrong racism was, and this is the good thing about this movie.But unfortunately the actions of the people were in my view totally unrealistic, Django and his friend are the good and ethically perfect and pretty much all other characters are evil people, as evil as it gets.I know Hollywood movies like the good and the bad thing, but for me if this is all there is, and a bit of shooting around it is not enough...The worst thing is the ""handshake moment"". OMG...At some point whole thing got all too predictable and boring. For me the movie is a big waste of time."
tt0133093,"Let me say that I do like this film, the acting was decent, the plot was good, and the special effects were amazing. But I've seen much better movies and I don't think The Matrix should have gotten 8.5 stars on IMDB. Maybe 6.5-7 stars...not 8, it should not be in the top 250. I'm sure there are those that disagree with me but if they really paid attention to this movie, and not be caught up in the craze, I think they'd realize it's just a decent sci-fi movie. It should not be given that many stars, and that there are other movies much better than this one.The plot is Keanu Reeves plays Neo, a man that thinks something is wrong with the world, and is struggling to find out what it is. He eventually finds Morpheus, who explains to him, why the world seems fake..*minor spoilers revealing plot ahead*.The reason is because the world as we know it is not real, it is really a computer matrix made by machines in the REAL world. The machines create humans in the real world, and load them into the matrix. That way while humans are in the matrix the machines are feeding off their energy to fuel themselves. But Morpheus and his gang have been unpluggged, and they explain all this to Neo, and it results to the amazing special effects climax.This movie is good, not great. I give it 3/5 stars, no more. It's a good sci-fi film with a good potential and special effects, no more."
tt0137523,"David Fincher's ""Fight Club"" takes viewers on a visually exhilarating journey but ultimately stumbles due to its convoluted and often morally ambiguous narrative.The film's unnamed protagonist, portrayed by Edward Norton and referred to as ""Jack"" in the script, serves as the narrator, guiding us through his descent into a hellish existence and his unsatisfying redemption at the film's conclusion. Jack is an insomniac who works as an insurance investigator evaluating defective products, while his apartment, adorned with IKEA furniture, symbolizes the hollowness of consumerism and advertising culture.Discontented with his life, Jack immerses himself in various support groups, forging fleeting connections with fellow attendees. His encounter with Robert Paulson (Meatloaf), a man with testicular cancer, underscores his inability to form meaningful relationships, particularly with women, as he later crosses paths with Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), another social outcast who attends support groups without genuine need.Initially, the film unfolds as a dark comedy before evolving into what some may term a horror narrative. Jack's alter ego, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), guides him down a perilous path. The revelation that Jack has become Tyler marks the climax, with others recognizing this transformation.Tyler initially appears as a liberating force, promoting Fight Club events as a means for individuals to release their pent-up anger and reject consumer society. Fincher's depiction of Tyler as representing the Id is only the surface; he encourages his followers to embrace anarchy, leading to a series of criminal acts that challenge the established order.Fincher's rationale for the film prompted discomfort among many critics. Is physical violence a path to catharsis, as argued by Norton following the film's release, or is it an immoral criminal act with potentially deadly consequences, even in a controlled setting?The horror intensifies as Jack allows Tyler to establish Project Mayhem, a cult-like organization that carries out violent acts. Jack is appalled by the brutality, especially when his friend Paulson is killed by the police. Jack eventually comprehends that he is Tyler and bears responsibility for the violence. He eliminates Tyler's influence by shooting himself, surviving the ordeal.However, this victory is pyrrhic, as Tyler has already set time bombs to destroy major credit card companies, ensuring a worldwide financial collapse. Fincher seems to want us to focus on Jack's epiphany as a moral triumph, but the film's downbeat ending leaves us with an ambiguous message that both applauds and dismisses Jack's actions. In essence, Fincher tries to have it both ways.Both Brad Pitt and Edward Norton deliver commendable performances that demand frenetic acting, and Fincher excels in the visual department. However, the film's moral ambiguity ultimately hinders its impact, leaving ""Fight Club"" struggling to find its footing."
tt0372784,"This movie is in the top 80 of best films?? Obviously a bunch of little kids are putting in multiple 10 votes for this film. It was nowhere near the top 80. Katie Holmes was so dreadful I couldn't believe she was in this film. Christian Bale did not make s good Batman either compared to the previous actors who played the character. Let's be honest people. This movie was a joke. There was much about the plot that didn't make sense, the villain, the universe that was previously created by previous Batman movies should not have been ignored and discarded to start over with this mish mash, and what exactly the villains were plotting. It was, as one previous post eloquently put it, in a jumbled ill-conceived mess. But a movie that lots of little kids really liked because it appealed to their short attention spans and small minds."
tt0110912,"It took fifteen years and a subscription to Netflix to finally get around to seeing this film. It was well worth the wait. If all one were to see is the byplay between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, it would be worth the price of admission. But this is only part of the incredible effect this film has. I don't even like gore in movies; I avoid it. But Tarentino weaves a culture of violence where there is actual humanity. We care about these bad guys. There is scene after scene of people being pushed to the limit. The very idea that the boxer, played by Bruce Willis, would risk everything to retrieve a watch that has been transported on two occasions, shove up someone's ass, is amazing. And very, very funny. I can't begin to list all the wonderful scenes. The opening dialogue is incredible as Trovolta and Jackson are on their way to do a hit. They have virtually no respect for human life, yet they, themselves, are very human. The date scene with Uma Thurman with the adrenaline shot. The crazy's in the pawn shop. And, the effort to clean up the car after blowing away a kid in the back seat, the issue being that a guys wife would come home and be very unhappy to find a dead body and a blood filled car in the garage. It sounds horrible and makes me sound sick. I found Fargo to be a hilarious film as well. Is there something wrong with me?"
tt0120737,"The problem with this film is not it's look, as it does look amazing, but it's length and  confusing nature.  Now if you've read the book then I dare say you'd have an idea what's going on but if you haven't then what I am told is an 'awesome epic' becomes a rather long film involving walking. And boy do they walk. they walk up hills, through forests, caves and over mountains. And then then walk some more!Another fault with the film is that although the cast has been assembled to be true to the book, none of them have any presence at all. It all makes you wish that someone with some charisma would turn up in a car and get on with it"
tt0137523,"If I had seen this as a teenager, I might have liked it better. Unfortunately, for an adult, this just felt quite juvenile.There's this type of film that tries so hard to be ""edgy"" and ""cool"" that it comes across as insincere and artificial. It often works on teenagers, as they lack comparison.I kinda feel like complaining about the utter objectification and lack of humanity of the one woman in this film, but then all of the characters were so made up. I'd probably be much angrier about a film like this if it came out today - there are certainly qualities to this that could be actually harmful.If nothing else, Fight Club works as a cultural reference point. Anyone you meet who is a very vocal fan of this film is quite likely to fall into a certain category of person."
tt1375666,"I would like to say just something short, and I hope that some of the directors will notice that: Please, let the Matrix alone. You can't beat it with quasi ideas. This film for me is nothing but a stolen ideas. Even from Anachronox I found some stolen ideas. The plot is based on the stolen idea, even if it has some originality, all around the plot is empty because it is without some deeper thoughts.If the resources were spent on wrapping some more flesh around the details and story, all could have be different... Like this, too many questions: How they meet each other in the dreamworld? Where are the details and explanations? What HOLDING that world to don't fall apart????... There are more questionable reactions and scenes, but I don't want to go deeper because it is not worth.This film is insult for the Matrix fans.And by the way, only old people can lay down and sleep immediately."
tt0993846,"Leonardo Dicaprio is too good in this movie, he deserved a Oscar, at least he won in Revenant."
tt0111161,"It is strange that this movie is 2nd in imdb chart, as it is the same old american story, where good people win, and bad guys died. More strange, the USA is still the place where this story must sound more false."
tt0172495,"Academy's shameful act for ignoring Sir Ridley Scott for Best Director.
Shame on you Academy, Shame on you.."
tt0167260,"I want to be as honest as possible in my review of this film, I comment on this movie as I feel outraged that it has been given such a high rating on IMDb. First my credentials as a fair and impartial reviewer: I am a native New Zealander, my mum new Peter Jackson well & I quite enjoyed his early films, Bad taste,the Frighteners, Heavenly creatures & particularly Brain dead. Some of the movie sets were just a few miles from my house, and I had the opportunity to work as an extra on the trilogy and all were treated graciously. Additionally I was a huge fan of Tolkien's book and had a sense of excitement and wonder that the Lord of the rings was to be made into 3 films in my home country. Many of the bad reviews posted here compare the book to the movie and the movie will always come off worse, and I must admit that when I saw the Fellowship I was horrified at how bad and boring it was compared to the book, but come two towers I came with an open mind and quite enjoyed the film, judging it on its own merits and I had the same plan going into the return of the king.Additionally I must admit there were a few parts of the Return of the king that I thoroughly enjoyed; The lighting of the torches, the juxtaposition of the brave warrior riding of to almost certain death, to please and prove himself to his father, while dad casually feasts on grapes supported by a beautiful song, the scene where the kingdom bow down to salute the brave hobbits. Also the brothers acting was fine. aannndd thats about it.This movie was awful for me first and foremost because it did not draw me in to the story, for only seconds at a time did I care for or could I make sense of the story and the acting, I was simply bored and restless. Some of the reasons for this follow:The length: 3 hours + +? Peter, have you heard about the innovations in film editing?, and what is with the multiple endings? It was like one of those nightmares where you wake up, but you are really still in the dream and can't seem to get out! I believe a natural ending would have been with the salute to the hobbits.Frodo: Oh Nodo!!, Frodo wore only one expression on his face for the entirety of two towers, and the majority of fellowship and return. You know that look of pained resignation, of sore weariness. All those head shots kind of got boring. Also I just did not buy him turning on his loyal companion Sam, taking the rascally creatures word over his. Additionally having struggled so long and hard, being so pure of heart for the whole journey, you just suddenly decide you want to keep the ring at the last moment? c'mon!Sam: (Smithers)The part where Frodo sends you away and you start to cry, I wish I could erase the pained forced feeling of that scene from my memory.Warrior woman: I can't remember whether it was in the book or not, but the ease with which you dispatched an enemy far more powerful than you, or just about anyone for that matter, seemed a little unlikely. It Bet Daniel Son's victory over a vastly superior opponent in KK3 hands down.Hordes of the undead: Those ghostly figures Aragon summoned, Um, it wasn't too suspenseful for me seeing them do battle, since they were invincible and could not be attacked back!Legolas: A shame to see the kick arse archer from fellowship & towers reduced to a one very fake looking scene taking down the baddies on the elephant.Dwarf: I like a dwarf to be ascetic and noble, not comic relief.Aragon: Why did you change your voice tone and go all James L Brooks on us when giving your Coronation speech? My friend suppressed a laugh.Karl Urban: There was an excellent scene in the trailer where you screamed and wailed at the sky, below your father-the king's body lying dead on the earth, that scene really got my heart racing, I can't believe it was absent in the movie.The Battles: Who was fighting who? the editing was such that I couldn't see which characters to root for as the action flied by too quickly and clumsily.Golem: We get that the ring has corrupted your soul and turned you into something horrible over the years, we get that you will make a play for the ring before the film is out. Was the opening scene biography really necessary?Finally and by far most disgracefully, please keep in mind that all three films were filmed at the same time, using the same actors, production crew and locations. The first two movies got just a few Oscar nods in minor categories such as sound effects editing, How can Return of the king be THAT much better than the other two that it sweeps up 13 or so Oscars, everything for which it was nominated! Shame on you academy!!, my guess is that the Money from New Line cinema was not all spent on making and advertising the film itself! Bouycott the Oscars!!"
tt0120737,"Ok I'm not talking about the theatrical version because the extended cut adds to the beauty of this trilogy.I recently bought the 4K HDR versions as I had not seen the trilogy in a while and wanted to watch them again. All I can say is wow, I was hooked straight away again with the beautiful story telling, amazing acting and the pacing of these movies is insanely good.The 4K HDR upgrade to the films are brilliant. It has never looked so good. The engravings on weaponry can be seen with great detail. The characters look so sharp, (every strand of Gandalf's beard can be seen), the scenery looks great and the lighting is spectacular. (Obviously I'm loving the 4K transfers)The sound is incredible to, if you have a great sound bar and surround sound you will definitely be in for a massive treat. Arrows fly past your ears from the side channels. The musical score sounds great, and it's the little details that make it great.Overall it was an amazing chance to return back to these movies, especially the fellowship of the ring.100% recommend.You'll be thinking about it for months!"
tt0102926,"I first saw ""Silence of The Lambs"" soon after it was released, as a schoolboy. It was one of the first ""mature"" films I saw and to this day the movie is kind of a benchmark against which I measure films. The creepy feeling it leave you without trying any of the cheap tricks (sudden loud noises, shots of copious amounts of blood ) that other thrillers do. I saw it years later in 2005 and still loved it.The movie's strong point is Jodie Foster and Anthiny Hopkins' acting skills ,again the benchmark against which I measure acting. The two make a great team and that was missing in the sequel ""Hannibal"".This is a movie of many skins its a thriller, a detective movie, a horror movie an entertainer and it deals with the nature of the human psyche too. Not an easy feat to be so many things at once but the director and cast pull it off.Certainly one of the best movies ever made."
tt0110912,Tarantino made his tricks again...He made us feel weird. Excellent performances in confused situations. This movie is just MEMORABLE!
tt0167260,"I loved & adored the Fellowship and Two Towers. I repeat. They are my top favourite films of all time, even above Star Wars & Blade Runner. These films had furious pace, plot unity, the characters had gravitas, the dialogue had consequence, the language was masterful and elegant, the music either beautifully dominated the scenes or perfectly underscored them with gracious subtlety.Return of the King was a bitter disappointment and a terrible movie. Gandalf ""the White"", seems no longer the wizard who defeated the Moria balrog! The Witch King of Angmar, whom Aragorn had stood against on Weathertop seemingly without much effort, and a few swings of this torch, seemed about to kick Gandalf into the dirt and make him eat it. The Orc general was pathetic as a disabled elephant-man. Most of the dialogues are utterly disjointed; the voices of the actors who had acted so brilliantly in the previous movies had no weight. I also felt what they were saying was pointless. Take the scene in which Pippin finds Merry on the Pelennor Fields - one says ""I found you"", the other replies ""yes, I knew you would"". How does that advance the plot at all?! The Black Lieutenant was a misguided attempt at comic relief at a crucial juncture of the film, when all seems despair. Some of the shots in Mordor were dubious - the sky behind the hobbit scenes a light grey, whereas as viewed from Gondor the sky is black!! What's the deal about Sauron becoming a light-house?! The soldiers of Minas Tirith are a bunch of incompetent poster-boys I wouldn't trust to defend against a poodle. What are the women and children doing still in the city after the orc armies have broken in?! Pippin seems to be able to run all the way from the Citadel to the lowest city level and back, twice, just to ask Gandalf to help him save Faramir. The Saruman scene was dreadful and the dialogue repetitive. The musical score had no soul, no uniqueness: it could have been the music in a 100 other films (and probably will be). The opening scene was pointless, badly acted, not believable, and served no other purpose other than delaying the beginning. What was the point of that Indiana Jones-Temple-of-Doom-skull avalanche in the mountain of the ghost army? The falling in love between Eowyn and Faramir is completely unsubstantiated and not believable. Alas, I could go on and on.I just don't understand people who liked it. Sure, it had superb CGI action, but frankly that's all. I suspect it appealed to Independence Day/ Alien vs Predator all-action-no-brains Jerry Bruckheimer fans.I do understand Peter Jackson - he was tired after working so, so hard, so many years on this single project. He just let his focus slip on the last straight-line (editing it, while already preparing for King Kong). A great pity. For me the trilogy is unfinished. In my opinion it could benefit from a complete re-editing but I doubt it will ever happen because of its Oscars. The first two should have been so recompensed - this one doesn't deserve being shown in a Tijuana whore-house as side-entertainment."
tt0172495,"Gladiator (2000): Dir: Ridley Scott / Cast: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris, Oliver Reed: Visually stunning depiction starring Russell Crowe as a gladiator whose life is marked by violence in an ugly fashion of sport. He is framed for murder and sentenced to death but he survives only to discover that his wife and son were crucified and burned. Central plot thrusts him in gladiator games where he spends wasted time hacking up soldiers. Triumphant art direction cannot save repetitious story. Director Ridley Scott successfully creates the era but this is hardly a match for his superior films such as Alien and Blade Runner. Crowe carries the film going from honoured soldier to a fighter placed within a bloody game of survival where only his revenge drives him. Joaquin Phoenix overacts tremendously as Caesar who is basically a cardboard villain destine for death and when it happens, it lacks the intended satisfaction. Wasted appearances by Connie Nielsen and Richard Harris. Oliver Reed even appears as an old gladiator who likely wiped his ass with toilet paper that contained more than what this screenplay does. The art direction and visual elements are in top form. The film reflects the Roman Empire and violent sport to entertain the lust for violence. Unfortunately the repetition and violent exploits of the screenplay render this perhaps the most overrated film of the year. Score: 4 ¬Ω / 10"
tt1345836,"We've all seen Batman. We all know Batman. While many people would use different terms to describe him, we all know who Batman is, how he acts, what he does. We've seen him played by plenty of actors such as Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney and, my personal favorite, Kevin Conroy, and all of them have left a mark on the character for better or for worst. Then, there's Christian Bale. Don't get me wrong here, Bale's a great actor, but he just... he... can't... play... Batman. At all. As Bruce Wayne, he's great. As Batman, he's... a goof. My point is Batman in this movie is an idiot. Don't act like he isn't. He's a doofus. He sucks at his job. He gets his butt kicked, falls for every possible trap and (minor spoiler here) trusts Catwoman on her word. That is the absolute least Batman-y thing to do. Ever. And for the record, does every person in Gotham City know Batman's secret identity?! AND HIS VOICE SUCKS. COULD NO ONE ON THE SET JUST STOP HIM AND TELL HIM ""F*cking rre-- seriously?"" BEFORE HE MADE THREE WHOLE FILMS TALKING LIKE AN IDIOT?!With the Bat-rant out of the way, TDKR. I enjoyed the other two films (The Dark Knight was great, if not a bit overrated, but it was the best live action Batman film) but this one just... felt lazy. Yeah. It was a lazy film. The overall plot is terrible. It has holes so big you could drive the whole cast of the Transformers films through it (Bane's entire plan, alongside how he takes care of Batman makes no sense, sending the whole police down the drain, Batman's escape, the city surviving the bomb, etc.). Tom Hardy is a good actor, but he was terrible in this role. How do you take him seriously?! HOW?! He's hilarious! He was also nothing like the comics (minor complaint, I know). And Talia? Talia Al Ghul got f*cked sideways. Batman's equal, huh? Leader of the League of Assassins? Interesting character? Maybe a cool love relationship? Nah, let's just make her a whatever evil villain and make her have sex with Batman. Sure. Anne Hathaway looks WAY too young to play Catwoman. She's not that bad, I guess, but she didn't really fit the role. The movie moves at a snail's pace. I know it's Nolan, but Jesus. 30 minutes of Batman. In a three hour long film. It drags like a car with no back wheels.And as a last ""Screw you"" to the fans, Nolan casted Joseph Gordon Levitt as Notrobin so that he can tease the fans with Robin and then call him Robin. Like he's shaking the keys in front of your face.The movie isn't terrible, it's somewhat competent, certainly not the worst Batman film ever, but it is overrated. Way too much. Let's hope the next one get's it better."
tt0120815,"Arguably the best war movie ever made. More than anything else, Saving Private Ryan is a must watch for it's technical aspects and masterful direction by none other than Steven Spielberg. The Oscar jury got it absolutely spot on, when they gave the oscar nod to him, and also the Cinematography by Kaminski was honoured. The great thing about this movie is the fact, the camera hovers around in such a manner, it places you right amidst the action. This is war, as it happened, bloody, brutal and relentless. The 27 min long, famous opening sequence alone makes this a must watch. It's technique was revolutionary when it released, and has been replicated many a times, but none so better than the original. Not without flaws though, Long and sometimes the dull characters can put you off, but still a must watch."
tt0313792,"The viewing public no longer judges Woody Allen films for what they are. There were posts badmouthing this flick before it ever came out, just because people don't like Woody. It was even worse with critics; very few of them judged Anything Else as its own entity. It didn't measure up to Annie Hall. Well, newsflash!  Annie Hall is one of those gems that holds a place in Woody's top ten. He may never make a picture of that quality again...and that isn't a bad thing. I look forward to each year with the knowledge that a Woody Allen film will be released, and though he may not make a Purple Rose of Cairo-quality film every time, I know that a mediocre Woody Allen film is much better than most other films in theaters. Anything Else was not one of Woody's best, but I would rather sit through it one thousand times before I would watch a piece of garbage like Cold Creek Manor again."
tt0268200,"In an early scene in ""Brigham City,"" a parishioner in the small town of Brigham shows up at the sheriff's office to ask for counseling on spiritual matters. She talks with the sheriff who also serves as the bishop of the Mormon church. He feels conflicted about discussing church matters on police time, yet goes ahead anyway and counsels the woman. The film is about the dual identities of Wes Clayton that define the character's strengths as well as his weaknesses.Wes walks with a limp, the result of a horrendous auto accident that took the lives of his wife and son, leaving him in a coma. He has since recovered and wears two hats as chief law enforcement officer and spiritual advisor to the community. When a body is dumped in the city, the atrocity sets in motion the work of a serial killer, which sends the town into a panic. Wes must now walk the tightrope in his two identities.This film project was due to the vision of Richard Dutcher, who wrote the screenplay, directed the film, and performed the leading role of Wes Clayton. Dutcher had a clear concept that transcended a straightforward murder mystery. Instead, the film offers underlying layers of meaning about the values of a faith-based community and the leader who wants to maintain a sense of ""paradise"" in Brigham. It would be a mistake to think of this film as a Mormon movie; it is much more than that.Clearly, Wes sees himself in a leadership role and genuinely wants to protect the members of his community from harm. But he is personally flawed and narrow in his view of the world. In the past, he made an unconscionable error in the hiring of an employee without a background check. He placed his trust in his instincts and in what he perceived were the shared values of his fellow human beings. By the end, he recognizes his human failing, and it is a moving testament to the community that stands behind him in compassion and solidarity."
tt1130884,"Martin Scorcese has laid many cinematic landmarks in crime genre, and as a result, has earned a spot as one of the most influential directors to ever step foot in Hollywood. He has been met with much critical acclaim with his gritty portrayal of the gangster life in his film such as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York, and The Departed. Teaming up with his frequent collaborator Leonardo Dicaprio, Scorcese takes a more dark and surreal direction in this psychological thriller set with plenty of twists and turns. Leonardo Dicaprio plays U.S Marshal Teddy Daniels, who travels across seas to investigate a mysterious and deserted island along with his partner Chucke Aule (played by Mark Ruffalo). There lies a hospital run by Dr. Cawley (played by Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Neahring (played by Max Von Sydow) holding mentally insane prisoners, where Daniels and Aule are in search of a patient named Rachel who has mysteriously disappeared. Going further into their investigation, the two quickly turn the dark and sinister secrets behind the wretched prison of a hospital, soon to the point where Daniels deteriorating of his mental state and his identity all together.Mixing elements of neo noir and elements of pure horror, this film conveys a dark and surreal plot that unfolds to something truly shocking and well crafted in a unique way. The psychological elements conveyed throughout the story go very deep in ways that may remind those who seen films like 'Seven' or 'The Sixth Sense' as these both deal with individuals who are psychological damaged. This film paces steadily through one spine- chilling thrill after another, and as the story progresses, the tone gets more and more eerie; building up an astonishing plot twist at the end that is likely to leave you startled. Like David Fincher's 'Seven', this film never lightens up in tone, giving you the feeling of hopelessness throughout its run time, yet it's still entertaining. The plot doesn't go without its flaws however. The film has its moments where gets overly convoluted to the point I could leave you scratching your head. Ultimately, the plot picks up not to soon before it reaches its grim climax.Leonardo Dicaprio has been one of my favorite actors for as long I can remember, an actors always shows off powerful performances, yet has never landed an Oscar for his works. His performance as the main character Teddy Daniels is terrific. He is very charismatic throughout, especially when his character go through some spine-chilling changes. Mark Ruffalo who plays his partner also deserves some applause for his performance, playing his role very solid and willfully. Ruffalo is who I believe is an underrated actor and hope garners an Oscar one day (as well as Dicaprio).Shutter Island is a twisted, but stunning piece of entertainment by Martin Scorcese, complete with a terrific screenplay, powerful performances, and a strong narrative that grabs your attention. This is much different than the typical Scorcese fare. Nonetheless, it is astonishingly entertaining."
tt1375666,"It was a pretty good movie, however, when I am able to predict the twists and turns that are going to be taken - and in the first 15 minutes of watching the movie - the movie automatically gets a lower score with me. I cannot count how many of these movies are being made, and most of them are using the same repetitive path - what you think is reality isn't - the one who's in charge - or 'In the know' is the one who's psycho, schizophrenic, or mentally unstable. I was surprised that after Leo did Shutter Island, that he'd just turn around and do the same kind of movie. (For those who didn't notice - the top kept spinning in the end shot - meaning he was dreaming - not actually awake - which means he was the one all along who was in err). The acting was a bit over the top and not convincing enough. The script wasn't that great, and I already can visualize certain types of people making attempts to practice this sort of thing. Among those 'certain types' you will also find hoards of conversations about 'lucid dreaming' and 'out of body experience', huge attractions to witchcraft, Harry Potter, etc, 'reality' shows, trash TV, RPG's and other games - basically - a lot of fantasy and unreality type of attractions. This movie will be a cult classic to them, maybe even their bible. The good thing about this movie does indeed need to be noted, however. We are living in an unreality & fantasy based society and it's ever growing. This movie shows the dangers of living in in that kind of mode, where a person starts getting more and more confused about what is real and what isn't. I ended up fast forwarding through quite a bit. It's getting a total score of 9??? Up for awards??? Com'on people. There's no logic why this movie is getting these kind of ratings."
tt0110912,"Three things I hated about this movie:1) The pointless and irritating dialogues - ""in France they call it Royal"". Yes, so McDonald's has different names for the quarter pounder in different countries. Great. Am I as a viewer supposed to find this fact surprising? or witty? or ""cool""? or what? In fact, the whole conversation about McDonald's was just dead boring. As were the conversations about drugs. ""Whos's motorbike is this? - It's not a motorbike, it's a scooter"" just made me want to punch that pedantic cretin.2) The gimp. Quentin Tarantino's prejudices aren't doing any favours to reputation the BDSM and gay communities. Most people who are into bondage aren't sickos, and I think propagating myths about BDSM is irresponsible. Oh, and of course, black people aren't into fetish. Ever. Everyone knows that, right?3) The dance. Not making any effort and just not generally giving a toss won't earn you a prize in real life."
tt0120815,"I don't think anyone is ever going to argue how great that opening landing sequence is ¬ñ just the shear chaos in which those men were consumed ¬ñ I found the chaos comparable to the scene in `Platoon' where they assault the V.C. bunker¬Öhowever, it does not (any part of the movie, in my mind) match up the finale of Platoon, in which one is so confused, your heart pounds, and it is in the end more horrifying than any of the combat sequences in Private Ryan.What really got to me about this film, were several things though¬Öfirst and foremost, is the `dumb German' syndrome, which leaves me with a bias feeling.  Why in the end, did Miller, Ryan, and Sarge have know problem mowing down the by passing Germans, then survive the same gauntlet, with almost twenty German's firing at them?Another thing, is I couldn't help but notice how far people flew through the air whenever hit by a mortar, or stepped on a land mine¬Öor hit by a grenade¬Öso on, so on.  I won't pretend to be a war-vet, or someone who's witnessed this, but it seems unlikely to me.  However, I'll stress my own ignorance, and say `don't take my word for it.'All in all, I found it to be a worthy action flick ¬ñ comparable, in my mind, to `The Big Red one.'  It has sad moments, and moments of brutality, but in the end, just left me with impressed memories of some of the combat sequences.As a sidenote, I think that the best ww2 films ever made are ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" two films that don't deal heaviliy with combat (TTRL more so).  Saving Private Ryan tried just a little to hard to force feed it.  I recomend all of these films, but for your knowledge, those are to me, the best."
tt0480025,"I do not understand all the great reviews this film received.Over the years we have seen many similar stories of a lad trying to cope after a family tragedy.In probably in over 90% of them there were likable people,especially the young lad.I saw only about 35 minutes & found nothing to like or care for.The young lad was presentable like most children are, BUT there was nothing for me to root for,This type role has been done before too many times to count.The rest of the cast looked like rejects from the East Side Kids films casting calls of years back. ALL stereotypes. At least the East End Kids movies had real laughs,the laughter here was forced.Ratings ** (out of 4) points 56 (out of 100) IMDb 5 (out of 10)"
tt0120737,"I am assuredly in the minority when I state Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy is some of the worst film making I have ever seen. It would appear that he and his production team read the books, sort of, maybe 30 years ago; bought the Cliff notes, and from that wrote the screenplay. To illustrate my POV, I recommend listening to the superlative 13 hour radio adaptation produced by the BBC, recorded I believe in 1981.Jackson and crew erred when they depended too much on computer fx, and spent too much time on the spectacle of combat and war. I often thought I was watching a slasher movie. What makes the original Trilogy compelling are the relationships and the subtext characters carry with them from beginning to end. To be sure there are mythic battles, both large and small. But they come out of very carefully crafted relationships and a deep well of subtext.I don't quarrel with the New Zealand locations, I do quarrel with the dumpy looking sets that were haphazardly glossed over with computer grafx fixes. I don't quarrel with the casting except Frodo, and yet I found the direction so superficial, and often perplexing, if not simply muddled (Galadriel as an English Vamp?!).A clue to my dissatisfaction can be found in the omission of Tom Bombadil, the only character in the original not affected by the Ring. His eccentric wisdom and unexplained powers ground the plot because there is something, someone who is outside the Dark Lord's power. There is in the Tolkien universe a power unimaginable which Sauron cannot touch. And that is essential to the fabric which holds Middle Earth together. Which Tolkien in his craft and his wisdom knew he had to give expression to. And Jackson in his foolhardiness ignored.Why didn't Jackson's team follow the books with more trust? The master had already worked it out perfectly. Well, almost. The Trilogy wasn't long enough, which Tolkien realized after its completion. Nevertheless, the project would have been immensely improved had Jackson and his team laid out a six episode franchise to match the six books of the Trilogy, taken more time to film it in their excellent locations of choice, and above all, truly paid homage to its original creator by following his work faithfully.These films are a mish-mash which titillated the masses for a brief time. And that is tragic, because it will be long, long before someone will be able to do them justice."
tt0109830,"This is a powerful yet charming movie; fun for its special effects and profound in how it keeps you thinking long after it's over. Like others, I've seen this movie more than once. One comment I've never heard is that Forrest's simplicity is almost zen-like. I should read the novel to get the author's intention (I remember some people preferring the book and complaining that no one at the Academy Awards gave him any credit.) But rather than an implication that you should do what you're supposed to do and believe in God and you'll win in the end, I see it as zen-like, i.e., living in the moment and not having expectations or particular cravings (other than his loving Jenny.) So he ends up just stumbling into all the major historical events of the time. Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn't have the brains to think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of our problems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. We love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the moment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both. It is something to mull over for a long time."
tt1130884,"'Shutter Island' is perhaps one of the best, if not the best, movies ever directed by Martin Scorsese. One cannot comprehend the experience in one-go. You will have to watch it twice or thrice to understand it enough, which is why Scorsese himself said back in 2010 that the movie would earn double profits because of people going to watch the movie twice.The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow. They have, without doubt, given an excellent performance. And since it is directed by Martin Scorsese, you will of course be appealed by the cinematography and direction. But what's the most striking feature of this movie, the thing that makes this movie a real success is it's plot. The movie is an adaptation of the 2003 novel 'Shutter Island' by Dennis Lehane. The first half of the movie is calm and steady, but it is only a setting up for the terrific, unexpected ending which is absolutely shocking and jaw-dropping. There are several clues and intentional continuing errors that foreshadow the twist ending. The film is also filled with anagrams reminding me of which, did you know that the title 'Shutter Island' is actually an anagram for 'Truth and Lies'.The background score is also amazing, especially the one by Gustav Mahler. The background score maintains the rythm of the movie.There is only one inclusion by Martin Scorsese in the film which was not originally in the novel, the dialogue ""Which would be worse - to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?"", which happens to be one of the most famous quotes in cinema.Overall, 'Shutter Island' is completely watchable and enjoyable. There is a lot to learn in this film while it intensifies you. Personally for me, it is the best psychological thriller."
tt0167260,"It's the movie event of the century...and I am completely unmoved! I didn't like the first two entries in the series, and I don't like this one. Right around the middle of the film, when I saw the tenth shot of a CGI soldier falling off of battlements and screaming, I realized that I was watching a farce - a big overblown video game more concerned with mindless action than telling a proper story. The character development is thin and far too sentimental, and even some of the effects are strangely flat - I didn't think Sauron really worked as an enormous spotlight, and Gollum should've been played by an actor in make-up (impressive as he is, he still looks unreal). The battle sequence is practically a re-hash of the fight from ""Two Towers,"" and the Liv Tyler scenes are distinctly repetitive, too. Any of the dialogue that wasn't from the books stuck out like a sore thumb - the wince-inducing Gimli jokes, for example. Suffice to say, I'm looking forward to the day when the special effects in these films are surpassed, and everyone has to look deeper at their dramatic content - which is sadly lacking."
tt1375666,"This movie has several dazzling special effects. But other than that, what is there to say. Well, mainly....YAWN. Many comedy movies are just sketches strung together with the barest of threads to hold the plot together. Inception does the same thing for action movies, the action sequences are held together with a plot that pretends to be complicated, but in reality is wafer thin and yet full of holes that you could put Incepton's entire budget for special effects into each one of them. Inceptions virtual world does not impress because it is a work of beauty without any connection with dreams at all. Take away the special effects and you are left with substandard, uninspired acting and a boring movie."
tt0372784,"This is the only Batman movie where the villains are not just complete losers but are also completely pointless. How can even begin to compare a mostly non-existent Scarecrow to the Joker in the first movie? The first half was pretty decent if not extremely unrealistic and highly questionable. At the end, there are too many things thrown together, making little sense. Its all one big bloody mess. There is no real plot in this movie.Bruce Wayne's character was completely ruined by bad acting not to mention ridiculous scenes. As batman, he did little fighting and comes out as a complete idiot. In one scene where Katie Holme's character pepper sprays someone, Batman is seen molesting...er...fighting in the background. It really does look like molestation. The second half of this movie is atrocious and total crap. The sets used are also crap."
tt0111353,"Screen legend Kirk Douglas in a TVM ! What a casting coup , I bet the teleplay had an outstanding script to entice Douglas to play the lead role Ed Reece . I can see why Douglas would have wanted to take the role since it deals with a dying old man living his last days and may have tugged heart strings since this may at the time we'd ever see Douglas acting . However this doesn't make TAKE ME HOME AGAIN outstandingThe problem is with a very mawkish script . Ed's draft dodging son Larry returns to the family home much to the disgust of the other family members . Granting his dying father one last wish Larry takes his father on a sentimental journey across America . If the family were disgusted at Larry before the journey they're even more disgusted now . It might be a good idea for viewers to keep some insulin handy due to the sugary sentiment on screen . Nothing very exciting happens apart from the father and son getting accosted by some rednecks and like all rednecks found in TVMs they're multi cultural onesAs a footnote this is available on DVD in Britian where it's known as THE LIES BOYS TELL which is a ridiculous title ( It conjures up images of a court case involving child abuse ) and TAKE ME HOME AGAIN seems far more sensible"
tt1853728,"The movie takes place 2 years before the civil war and begins with the slave dealers who take the slaves somewhere. Dr. King Schultz appears, he is looking for a man who can recognise three men called Brittle brothers. Dr. Schultz is not a dentist anymore, he is a bounty hunter. This is why Schultz want to find these brothers. They have bounty for their heads. One of the slaves says that I know these guys. He is no one but Django. He knows them because Brittle brothers persecuted Django and his wife. Thus Dr. Schultz and Django met. They make a deal which Django will be a free man after he helps Schultz to find these brothers. Some day Dr. Schultz learns that Django has a wife called Broomhilda von Shaft who is a house slave. After that day bounty hunting becomes a story which is about finding his wife and taking revenge. In general, the movie has original topic which keeps audience on the screen and incredible screenplay which fascinates us.
My favourite about the movie is acting. The cast is amazing even I do not have to mention about how good they are. We can feel every emotion while watching them. The fear that slaves have and how they change after they are unchained is worth to see. Persuasion skill of Dr. Schultz and how he treats to the guilty guys is impressive. Beside of this Mr. Candie's pressure with a skull was successful. Moreover, we can see Tarantino with a minor role. There are a lot of examples like these. Furthermore, musics and costumes are awesome. The people who prepared the costumes and who picked the musics are deserved to be appreciated. Literally I don't have anything that I don't like but I would like to see what happens next.
All things considered, this is a great movie with an unexpected script and gripping scenes. The movie is 9 out of 10 for me, I definetely recommend it to everyone."
tt0120815,"Yes, it is visually very good movie, and it's pretty accurate. In some moments it really touched me. But the story is incredibly boring. Me and my friends talked over the movie for like one hour. So 6/10 for me."
tt0848228,"OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!!!!!! I AM SOOOO BLOWN AWAY! THAT MOVIE WAS PERFECT! Sound familiar? Of course it does. Everyone seems to be in love with this movie. I don't know why, though.The action was nearly flawless, I will admit that. It looked very real and must have been among one of the most expensive movies of all time. However, action is not enough to convince me to be in love with a movie. What's number 1 on IMDb.com's top 250 movies of all time list? The Shawshank Redemption. Why is that movie so good? (Sorry if you aren't a huge fan of that movie). It was good because of the story line. The great acting. The great cast. There is not one action scene in that movie. Yet it is so good. I feel as though people like and/or love The Avengers for the opposite reason. The story wasn't exactly BAD or anything but I can't find anything special about it.Right from the very beginning- BOOM! Loki just happens to appear from Lord knows where. I love the idea of assembling a team of Super Powered People (super heroes) to form The Avengers. Great. I just feel like I could have predicted the entire movie. I expected Loki to appear, wreak havoc. The Avengers to assemble, all of them having lots of disagreements. Then in the blink of an eye they would work together and beat Loki in a huge battle. And where will this battle take place? NEW YORK!!!! How original!The acting was good, except I just can't stand Loki, or Tom Hiddleston, or both, I don't even know. I just think he is very annoying and not even close to a good villain. I find myself so unafraid of Loki while guys like The Joker or Bane or Venom scare me to death if I were ever to encounter them in real life (if they were real people).It was just very bland to me, there were some very funny moments and some moments that were very good action scenes. Doesn't mean I give this movie a 10 it doesn't deserve like other people. The fact that it is somewhere along the lines of an 8.2 just disappoints me big time. I would've expected like a 7.5-7.8. I don't think it deserves a spot among the top 250.I do like this movie, you can see I gave it 7 stars. As I said the acting, cast, and action is very good. But that doesn't mean the story line, predictability or the main villain is any good at all.All I can say is I've seen better hero movies."
tt0110912,"The overwhelming praise for this film is beyond my comprehension. While it has a handful of darkly funny moments, and a fair splash of style, it's episodic, tasteless, sometimes downright disgusting, and far too quirky to make a good film.It has so many elements critics decry at every opportunity as the things which prove ""holywood"" is completely out of touch with it's audience that it brands most as hypocritical. Seems to prove it's not the sex, drugs, violence, and vulgarity that critics actually object to, but simply the package they come in.This is basically dreadful sludge masquerading as hip!"
tt0114369,"Rarely does a thriller murder film draw in the audience from start to end without presenting predictable foreshadowing. From the opening credits leaving out Kevin Spacey's name to the consistent ""one step behind the killer"" storyline, Se7en accomplishes a dramatic theme of leaving the audience in a dynamic na√Øve state through the eyes of Mills and Somerset. Although the acting was emotionally and physically precise, it was the cinematography and lighting that generated the dreary setting and interactions throughout the film, often evoking the appropriately timed tension and emotion. Presented beyond the surface, however, Se7en calls upon a society accusation through the thread of Dante's ""Seven Deadly Sins."" Se7en indirectly advocates that society, as a whole, is migrating towards an inevitable abyss filled with specialization in many of these deadly sins. Even though humans may be ignorant to this path, it continues to occur all around us until we become dragged into it, just like Mills in the ending. The only individual within Se7en that posed a dichotomous relation was Somerset; as he continued to logically view the world in awe of the irrevocability. Somerset and Doe both saw the world in this 3rd person perspective, but their actions represented their individual commitment to the change of society. Doe was willing to take action in an upsetting demonstration, but Somerset continually wanted to escape the world in a hopeless fashion. Therefore, Se7en displays multiple protagonists and antagonists throughout the movie. On the surface, Mills and Somerset are the protagonists trying to stop the killer, John Doe, who is the antagonist. Indirectly being argued, however, is that Doe and Somerset are the protagonists with opposing plans towards the change in societal nature (being represented as the antagonist through the seven deadly sins characters including Mills). That is why I give Se7en a 10/10 for its ability to draw in the audience through cinematography, lighting, plot, and controversial character dynamic throughout the entire film."
tt0110912,"Well I had heard a lot about this movie earlier but after seeing it I can only say that it is a below average movie. I mean the only thing I enjoyed was some dialogs (although most of them were out of context)and nice editing job.But the story ,if there was one was plain boring .Acting was OK except Samuel who was great. I am very much surprised because it was nominated for 7 Oscars and got ""Best Screenplay"" award which was a big joke. Also Bruce Willis part was half baked and had very little significance for the story.So overall this movie which is a ""so called classic"" disappoints because bits of comedy like the Bonnie situation are not enough to make a movie classic."
tt1853728,This film started off good. It was going on a good direction that i thought was going to be the two main characters collecting various bounties but no..... it was a love story that tried too much to be like Kill Bill.It got to a point where it was like everyone was banging their heads against a wall to figure out how to end the film when someone must of said 'How bout a Kill Bill style fight scene with gun slingers??'Proper let down of a film. Had so much potential. The acting was good and the music but the last hour of the film just totally ruins it for me.
tt1130884,"It is hard to review this movie without giving away certain plot elements which would lead the reader to a final conclusion. Being sensitive to those that have not seen this movie, I will endeavor not to disclose such details.This movie was extraordinarily average in that it has been told many times and multiple levels, some often better than the sitting for this movie. While the cinematography was well done, it copied Deloris Clayborn in both format and style which surpassed this film. The cast is strong but it just can't overcome the uneven pacing of the film or the averageness of the script.As we prepared to see the movie, I informed my movie partner that the movie plot shouldn't involve certain twists else I would be very disappointed. Within the opening scene, the films ultimate conclusion was apparent so I was forced to suffer through the next two hours to see an ending I already knew. For some movies that isn't always a bad thing because getting there can be half the adventure (Lord of the Rings comes to mind) but in this case, between the poorly paced flashbacks and the current storyline, there was little to keep the audience excited.While the actors delivered strong performances, Dicaprio and Williams do not have on screen chemistry. Thinking of the awkward love scenes in Star Wars Eposides 2 & 3 with Anakin would give you some idea of how these two do not fit together.This is a Netflix movie and not something you want to pay $10 to sit through. It has been done before and a whole lot better than this movie."
tt0102926,"That the film has its moments cannot be denied. Hopkins is slightly over-the-top as the diabolical yet urbane Lecter, but it's an enjoyable performance all the same. Lecter's finest moment is when, bound, straightjacketed, and face-masked, he is brought before Senator Martin and, after relentlessly goading her about the fate of her daughter, blurts out the identity of Buffalo Bill and adds, ""Love your suit.""Beyond the superficial appeal of a character who can interject such misanthropic witticisms, Lecter embodies the repulsive seduction of this thoroughly erudite monster, utterly free of societal constraints in spirit if not in body. His intelligence is, if remorseless and amoral, open and searching and methodical. We are time and again shown his superiority to the FBI, who rush hither and yon after clues they don't begin to understand, and to the pettiness of his jailor, Dr. Chilton, who subjects Lecter to televangelist broadcasts as punishment for brutal misbehavior.Yet Lecter is poorly contrasted throughout the film, and his intelligence is falsely elevated by comparison to the unimaginative mediocrities he is up against. Starling is a dreary feminist with a white trash inferiority complex, Dr. Chilton is a preposterously snide asshole, and none of the other characters rise above their status as plot devices. There is something particularly prim and humorless and unlikeable about Starling, and it is impossible to determine why Lecter would take an interest in her childhood trauma about lambs.Several points regarding Lecter's escape make no sense at all, and at crucial stages the total incompetence of his captors is required to pull it off. That Hopkins manages to keep the suspense going is a testament to the actor's ability to rise above the script. Regarding the ultimate capture of Buffalo Bill, it is too much to swallow that Starling's success hinges upon uncovering photographs in the victim's abandoned bedroom years after it had been scoured for evidence by FBI agents. This twist hangs one ridiculous premise on another and is a sorry attempt to justify Starling's centrality to the story.The cinematography and direction do contribute something interesting to the tumultuous descent to Lecter's asylum cell, but are otherwise unremarkable. Buffalo Bill is more bizarre than chilling, and the final confrontation between him and Starling is contrived. The film ends on a note that suggests it could have been alot better.Warning: If you purchase the DVD of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, resist the urge to listen to Jodie Foster's commentary. While the lambs may be silent, it is next to impossible to get her to shut up. Her grating, man-hating (and totally outdated) style of feminist rhetoric comes close to self-parody, although not often enough to be truly entertaining. Conclusion: this √ºber-bitch is a gaseous windbag. But if you don't believe me, listen for yourself. You'll be saying ""Pass the Chianti"" before you make it through the first reel."
tt0172495,Great movie Russell Crowe deserves an Oscar for his role in the movie
tt1130884,"A fresh attempt to make a story with an unexpected twist to keep the audience guessing until the end is just what this films attempts to do. Attempts but doesn't quite succeed as well as others have before. The film does leave the audience wondering what really is going on. We have two detectives that arrive at shutter island and must figure out the mysterious disappearance of a patient.The set design and production values are well accomplished. Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo are accompanied by Ben Kingsley and perform outstandingly through the film. The acting isn't over done and is spot on for each character. The acting really brings to life the story. Although in parts the plot is quite disturbing and can make one look away and cringe for the most part it isn't full of holes and does all tie together.This film falls short however in the fact that it's so much of a tale about trying to figure out exactly what the real story is that you already guess what the real story is and then have to sit and wait for the picture to tell you what you already know. It's like watching the DaVinci code and knowing what the solution to the puzzle is, the intrigue loses something when you already have the answer to the riddle.All in all the film is something fresh and tries to be new, It's acting is superb and story line flows fairly well. It simply falls a little boring once you know the punchline. The ending line of the movie however does bump up the score one point just simply because you don't really know how it ends even after you know how it ends."
tt0108052,"When I was younger, I lived in Holland for a while, which is where I saw this movie when it came out in the cinema. Holland was very much in the thick of things during the war, so I had learned all about the horrors that happened there during history classes. I would say I was awed by this movie, although that is perhaps not the right word. Shocked definitely, and saddened too. I watched it again last year, and although the impact wasn't as strong, I still thought it to be very powerful, and deserving of an 8/10"
tt1130884,"WARNING - Contains spoilers - WARNINGMartin Scorsese adapts Dennis Lehanes's novel Shutter Island into a near perfect film. Starring alongside Leonardo DiCaprio is Sir Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, John Carroll Lynch and Elias Koteas. If you're a fan of Scorsese you'd know that his cast always delivers and this one was no different. The acting for the majority was top-notch but DiCaprio especially stood out. He was absolutely amazing, his attitude, intensity and emotions in his eyes made you feel what he was going through at every point throughout the film. For his performance he deserves the best actor nod for next year's Oscars. The story revolves around two U.S. marshals Teddy Daniels (Dicaprio) and Chuck Aule (Ruffalo) who are sent to Boston's Aschecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane; which is located on the island to investigate a disappearance of an inmate. When they arrive they're told by Deputy Warden McPherson (Carroll) of what is where and the rules. This scene engages you instantly and makes you curious about what is hidden behind all those locked doors. Next they meet Dr. Crawley (Kingsley) who informs them of what has happened since the prisoner vanished and this is when the investigation begins. Throughout the search, we were shown multiple locations that made the atmosphere authentic; they didn't have to use music in order to make you anxious and or frightened. The different types of landscapes they utilized worked perfectly. For once there weren't any CGI and green screens in this, and I'd like to thank Mr. Scorsese for using actual environment shots on the island. However some of the scenes were irritating. For instance one scene, which involved a fire, was beyond annoying when two of the characters were in this cave discussing the matters about the island. The usage of fire was a good choice for light but shot in the worse way possible; while they were talking the flames kept flickering in front of their faces. That was such a horrible distraction and made you want to close your eyes and sleep through the scene. Don't know if it was Scorsese or the Director of Photographer that decided to shoot the scene like that but it should never be done again. During another sequence of events, the parts that got frustrating were the constant flashbacks. Even though it's based on a novel which should be followed to a certain degree, some of the scenes should have been cut. It was confusing sometimes because you didn't know if it was real or a flashback. With all these different flashbacks, it felt like it was Saw for several minutes and with regards to these scenes it almost takes away the flow of the movie. Nevertheless, this is one of the best psychological thrillers out there. This is a must-see for everyone except for children. Do not bring your child to this. As much as this is an amazing film sadly it's the type of movie you see once.9 out of 10"

All for naught in the grand scheme of things and a bit of a disappointment. And yes that is Franco Nero as the original Django in a cameo."
tt1130884,"Guess who praised Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island""? Roger Ebert! The cinematography, the spooky atmosphere, the film noir's overtones, the whole psychological torment, the ""buried trauma"" to quote him, as so many voices speaking in favor of ""Shutter Island"", another great achievement from the greatest director of his generation.Marty might be the greatest as the most consistent director of the New Hollywood generation but I hate how 'great Marty film' started working like a pleonasm, as to underline a tacit rule that any movie made by a great film-maker automatically deserves the benefit of the doubt, in other words: if you hate it, you didn't get it. I'm sorry again, but the director who committed this cinematic piece of unoriginality is not the passionate artist who enriched cinema with so many masterpieces, like ""Mean Streets"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"" and such delightful little gems like ""The King of Comedy"" or ""After Hours"". I'm sorry but Marty didn't gain in maturity, not even in craftsmanship, he purely and simply ¬Ö lost his touch.I have the biggest respect for Scorsese, and also for Ebert, and the reason I mentioned the latter is because he's certainly Scorsese's number one fan, but he's also one of these privileged persons who've seen so many movies in his life that he would be the least likely to get so easily impressed by a film, that blatantly exploits every single cinematic clich√©, considering the story's material. The movie is so 'obvious' that it would be tragic if it wasn't so laughable. And it's obvious because it works on that reverse effect, as movie fans, we know that whatever seems obvious in the first act will probably be contradicted. True BUT whatever seems obvious is exactly the opposite of what is shown during that very first act, because we know we're being tricked by the director. In that case, it's like Scorsese was the 'sprinkled sprinkler', and Ebert's implicit denial of the script obviousness says a lot about his recurrent loss of subjectivity whenever it concerns Scorsese.I don't want to number all the clich√©s: the two detectives investigating, the entrance in the island with a haunting atmosphere emphasized by an ominous music, begging you to be scared, or impressed, a weird feeling of unrealism in some backgrounds that made me question what the artistic approach was, let's just call it 'homage' to old-school cinema, this one never gets old. But I wouldn't have expected this emphasis on the tone, screaming ""Beware ¬Ö danger"" not even from old-school directors, and certainly not from Hitchchock. Okay, we got the idea that something will go wrong; it doesn't even trust our patience as Di Caprio acts weirdly from the very first scenes. I was pleased by Ben Kingley's performance as the charming head doctor, but it's getting old since Nurse Ratched and I didn't mention Fritz Lang, because there are less risks that he might be known by the targeted audience.And I'm not even implying that the movie is not worth watching, but it plays like an overlong build-up for a weak climax, a build-up, during which nothing very pleasing happens. And I mean 'pleasing' in the pleasing meaning of the word, seriously. What happened to Marty's sense of entertainment? Why such a constant need to be dark, Gothic and gloomy? Is that Cinema's new emotional trend? Are we supposed to endure this atmosphere during the whole picture? Can't we have a break? a distracting element, not necessarily a comic relief, but I don't know, a subplot, an interesting character, even Hitchcock did it¬Öno, again, the time-filler relied on the guilty trauma, the good old theme so cherished by Marty, and that provides the best alibis to rationalize his films. And we discover his wife played by a beautiful Michelle Thomas, and some horrific flashbacks featuring the Nazi's atrocities, always a good taste to combine the supernatural horror with the real one, that's what the movie needed in case we thought we would cheer up at the end. Or was he just surfing on an opportunistic wave introduced by Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds""?The weaknesses of the plot canceled out all the cinematographic attempts to justify the movie's cinematic merit. Nothing special happens, nothing really happens, and again, it's so damn hard to feel sympathetic toward Leonardo Di Caprio! Yes, I have a big problem with Di Caprio in Scorsese's film, because of that same constipated face he has to display, to remind us that he's playing a tough guy. Did Bogart look tough? Di Caprio is a good actor, even great sometimes, but this is becoming one of his most annoying trademarks. I miss the young, lively Di Caprio with sparkling eyes and youthful look, because tough he isn't, and he doesn't fool anyone, and this is probably why the only Marty's movie I thought he delivered a great and flamboyant performance was ""The Aviator"". The first thing I see in a Di Caprio film now, is the poster, tough-guy-constipated-face? I avoid.An indigestible film with a risible attempt to scare us, I will stop here because I'm tired of being so critical about the director whom I praised most of his work from the 70's to the 90's. But he just doesn't do justice to his glorious filmography, Scorsese is a man of gripping realism of psychological torture and it doesn't need a supernatural flavor to taste good, it's scarier when real and more than that, Scorsese is a damn entertainer, with a unique talent of storyteller, and not only the story isn't told well, but it's not even a good story, as far as originality is concerned.And when comes the final scene, with the final line, supposed to summarize the whole message of the film and justify the whole build-up, my only reaction was : ""so, we got from that ¬Ö to that?!"" and this is my exact feeling when I compare between Marty's earlier and later works."

tt0167260,"WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!What a disappointment the 3rd film is. We greatly enjoyed films I and II but this is a massive let-down. There seems to be little or no character development in ROTK, and this exacerbates the latent weaknesses is the first two films. I'm afraid that a lot of this is because of perverse alterations from Tolkien.First, Aragorn. In the book he is both a ranger from the north, but also a man destined to be king. He knows who he is, and he has an expectation of that destiny. Likewise in the book he has 'spiritual' awareness. Aragorn is descended, not merely from men, but from Numenor: so he already has in him some of the blood of the Elves. Now, Jackson gives all foresight to the Elves - making the men merely, men. But the whole point is that the-man-born-to-be-king has the spiritual awareness of the great kings of old. Thus, in book II at the river it is Aragorn, not Legolas (as in Jackson's version), who is aware of a shadow growing in his heart. And, more significantly, it is Aragorn who in the book takes the palantir by his right (Gandalf actually bows to give it to him). Gandalf counsels him not to use it, but Aragorn knows who he is. So he looks in the palantir and shows Sauron the sword. He challenges Sauron, and then wrenches the palantir away from the Eye to use as HE wills. In so doing he sees the black fleet, and so knows the threat. That's why he takes the path of the dead (Elrond never turns up at Dimholt). And when he takes the paths of the dead he REALLY summons the dead. The exchange in the film between Aragorn and the Geoffrey-Rush-Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-look-alike ghost is feeble in the film. In the book Aragorn does not doubt who he is: he calls them, not barters with them. Aragorn's action here is part of a much larger cohesion in Tolkien that is entirely absent in Jackson. Result? We're left with a desperately anti-climactic coronation. Why? Aragorn's character been denuded of a sense of who he is.Second Sauron. It's true that in the book he is mostly referred to as the Eye. But he also has personality. In the film, apart from the opening sequence to film I (which was brilliant) all we have is a plasma lamp sometime searchlight. Since in the book Gandalf has told Frodo that 'Sauron is taking shape again' why didn't Jackson develop Sauron from the figure in film I? In the book, we are told of Sauron's gnawing doubt. We hear of reports about 'spies' entering Mordor. We know that he is consumed by fear of the upstart heir of Elendil. None of this is developed in the film. (And the Ring seems to lose power on entering Mordor, not gain it!)Result? There was no sense of elation at the fall of Barad'dur.Now this is a serious theological error that I suspect Tolkien would have detested. Personify good, and you must also personify evil. Tolkien's epic was all about those forces being personified: and how you discern them. Sauron's not actually the worst form of evil - that belongs to Morgoth (of whom the Balrog is a servant). Whilst Tolkien rightly loathed allegory, he nonetheless never would have countenanced such a weak and ineffectual portrayal of the enemy. Tolkien's point is that evil in many guises takes human form: something that Jackson shouldn't have missed in today's world.The same lack of characterisation in Aragorn and Sauron goes on with many of the others. Jackson made a mistake in cutting Saruman out of III having made so much of him in I and II (more than the book). Arwen is drippy throughout. Eowyn is changed in the film. Jackson plays up the love between her and Aragorn so much that we are left wondering how Eowyn is apparently beatifically happy to see him with Arwen. On the subject of Eowyn it's such a shame Jackson didn't do the slaying of the witch-king better. In the book the battlefield pauses - a cloud goes up and everyone in Minas Tirith is happy. It's one of the truly great moments, lost by Jackson. The reports even leak back to the orcs in the tower above Shelob's lair (as they would of course) so that Sam and Frodo hear that 'No.1. has been done in'.As for the hobbits . I think this may be a question of preference. Personally I think Sean Astin's acting as Sam is execrable, but some like it. For me, the simple gardener becomes a mini-philosopher and I find his soliloquy both at the end of film II in Osgiliath (to which they never go in the book) and on the mountain (twice) truly toe-curlingly dreadful: pap I'm afraid. And, oh dear, we even veered towards Titanic-music-moments at the end of film I and again on the mountain. Bilbo was fine until the end. Yes, we know he ages fast now he's lost the ring, but the Salieri-style prosthetics are poor. Jackson loves the slow-motion work so much that we have to endure some particularly dreadful sequences with the Hobbits (most notably the already infamous bed scene) and at the end (where I really thought Frodo was going to give Sam a full-on smacker!). A similarly tacky piece of directing occurs when the elves appear - the soft focus lens is deployed with 'celtic' singing. Argh -  this is kindergarten film production.I expect the film will garner the Oscars ceremony. But I hope some people in Tinsel town have the courage to acknowledge that whilst some of the visuals are outstanding (though many are not - e.g. the oliphaunt descent by Legolas, the Merrick-style leader of the orcs, and the Army of the dead), the film is not actually very good at all.Peter - I'm afraid you've let us, and J.R.R. Tolkien, down."
tt0993846,"One of the many reasons The Wolf of Wall Street didn't sit right with me is that I couldn't tell what it was trying to say. It seemed to glorify what Jordan Belfort and his cohorts did instead of condemning it. And at some points, the movie that was trying to tell us about deplorable debauchery became deplorable debauchery itself. It's an interesting story featuring good acting, but overall it's just kind of disgusting."
tt0372784,"I find that some movies use music, 'witty' or attempted dramatic dialogue, British people, and ninjas to make you think that its a good movie before you can form your own opinion. I'm not saying that these elements (among many others of course) can't be used correctly, just that they are often used to trick the audience in the same way as special effects or 'lots of colors and noises' are (in a brainwashing kind of way).One of the main tricks I found in this movie was the gimmicky premise to try and put batman in the so-called real world. Here we have Gotham with normal skyscrapers, supposedly normal, real people, and an attempt at explaining everything that Batman goes through. But to me, this is where the movie shot itself in the foot--the ideas of Batman don't belong in this world, and it's obvious in the attempted explanations throughout the plot. For example, Alfred says that the only way to avert suspicion about buying bat-ears for the costume is to order them in bulk. Of course, this is nonsensical, because they are still ordering tons of rubber ear shaped things which could be tracked veeeery easily (its not every day a private party orders ten thousand rubber ears).In the beginning, I found the mystical ninja society of justice to be completely misplaced next to the otherwise realistic prison camp that appeared in the opening. I mean, they both 'looked' realistic (they had real tables, real people, etc...), but one of them had criminals being punished for crime, and the other was a league of unknown ninjas whose predecessors had sacked Rome 1500 years earlier (or whenever that happened).I would have liked it better if the movie had stuck with Tim Burtons style by making the prison and cities look less realistic, because then the transition from normal to absurd would not have been so obvious. When its all absurd, its believable, but when it tries to be both absurd and believable, its just silly.Additional things that bothered me a little each, and all together made the movie less fun (most of this has to do with the 'realistic twist' of the movie failing in my opinion):-Why didn't anyone from Wayne enterprises recognize that batman was using a car designed by their company and thus realize that it was Bruce Wayne who was Batman.-If Batman was real, his shenanigans would kill many civilians via use of the stupid tank (can you tell I didn't like the new car), which goes completely against the theme of justice.-If people could call a hundred thousand bats with a sonar device the size of a cell phone (and from inside a building), then that would be pretty amazing--where can I find one? Oh... I can't. Just because some bats use sonar as a guide doesn't them all come to me when I make a certain noise (even if i made a sexy mating call).-*warning: cheap shot* Why was the Gotham DA ten years old?-MICROWAVES THAT COULD BOIL WATER AT AN ENORMOUS RADIUS WOULD BOIL THE WATER IN ALL HUMANS THAT WERE ANYWHERE NEAR IT, KILLING THEM ALL (yes, even Raz-al-gul and Batman who managed to fight next to it near the end).-Why would someone build an armored rocket powered jumping car just to cross a river with a rope. (wouldn't it be easier to fire the rope across without the car?)-Batman made all of his bat-stars with a grinding wheel? Wow!-I didn't know that memory alloy was the secret to human flight (I always thought it was only good for making wrinkle free clothes or bending spoons). Why haven't inventors jumped all over this one yet. Again, why did they try to explain all of this?! It just sounds stupid to people who know a little about it.-It's a good thing that Morgan freeman had enough time to spray-paint the tank black. Because it wouldn't have been kewl otherwise.-All the goons were stupid in this movie! Argh! And not in a comical way like in other Batman series/cartoons/movies.Anyway, I thought that the movies was okay when I left the theater, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it was just one big gimmick with a bad plot. My rating for it has subsequently dropped. Besides my complaints though, it was somewhat entertaining. I wouldn't see it again though.^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ *~* *~* *~* *~* *~*5/10"
tt0114369,"To be honest, I don't understand what's so great about the movie. I've never seen the whole movie. I don't know why. I always give up watching it during the movie 'cause it bores me. I don't find it exciting at all. Just two policemen chasing a guy. I've seen similar movies that are way thrilling than this. And the reason why the guy is killing are stupid. It's just not inspiring enough for me to make me sit down and watch the whole thing. I always end up zapping on another channel or pick up a book to read. Morgan Freeman is a wonderful actor. He's the reason why I'm trying to see the movie every time it goes on TV. But not even him can make me interested to make it through to the end. And Brad Pitt. I can't stand that guy. He's not that good as he think he is."
tt0372784,"I'd think 16 years later more people would start recognizing this for the campiness that it is. Give me lame special effects over this quick-editing mess that doesn't even try to show Batman's abilities on the screen.Other than the editing, what is really dragging this movie down is the scene where Batman saves the girl from the high-dosage of poison. ""She doesn't have long"" turns into a 10+ minute unnecessary delay. I feel bad for Katie Holmes who had to act out fear and dying for 10 minutes, with nothing to do but sit in a car. Why didn't Batman carry a spare dosage of anecdote with him? Because this Batman is stupid, that's why.So the Bats just spent 7 years learning how to be invisible. Now that he has escaped the building and is unseen in the alley, he decides to get inside his large conspicuous bat-tank and lead a chase throughout the city while news helicopters film him. After causing the destruction of several police cars (nice heroics, Batman), he gets on an unpaved road and drives straight to his batcave in the rain. As if the police can't follow the tracks of an 8-wheel tank in the mud. Sooooooooo stupid.Now that Batman, as Bruce Wayne, is at his birthday party, he is surprised by Ras Al Ghul. Why Rassy decides to reveal himself is beyond me, it goes against everything the character stood for in the first 30 minutes.And Bruce Wayne, who defeated Ras the first time because he used a distraction, cannot beat Ras on Bruce's home turf. Bruce didn't install anything in his OWN HOME that would be useful in a fight situation? Turns out he learned literally nothing in 7 years' training.Also, love how Bruce just stood there watching goons pour gasoline in his home and light it on fire. LMAO. If he had fought them before the fire, he probably could have won, captured Ras, and kept his house from being destroyed. (And since the goons escaped we now have a loose end of 4+ people who know Batman's identity and this is never addressed.)The film shows Scarecrow fear by using a shaky and blurry camera reminiscent of the low-budget Blair Witch Project. Katie Holmes defeats the Scarecrow with just a taser (btw, where was her taser during the first encounter with the Scarecrow?) The fear-struck drugged citizens that are supposed to be rioting are like slow-walking zombies that do no damage.""I won't kill you but I don't have to save you"", what a line, what a line. It's not like Batman orchestrated the removal of the train's tracks and then incapacitated Rassy so he couldn't quickly escape. From this angle, Batman's character arch went from saving his nemeses to murdering them.The only saving grace in this movie is that Katie Holmes gets Bats to reveal his identity, and then she rejects him. Hilarious."
tt0848228,"I was lucky enough to score tickets to a prescreening of The Avengers in my city. I'd loved all the other Marvel movies leading up to it, so I was really stoked.The Avengers is the superhero movie we've been waiting for. Don't get me wrong, I love the darkness of other superhero movies, like The Dark Knight, but as Nick Fury aptly puts it: ""maybe we need a little old-fashioned"". And this movie is exactly that. Joss Whedon gives us precisely what superheroes used to be - extraordinary people fighting their flaws to become the saviors of the human race.In all fairness, The Avengers is not a film that requires much thought. It's a beautiful spectacle, but it definitely does not possess Oscar-worthy performances. It's slightly campy and tongue-in-cheek, which is oddly refreshing. The Avengers never takes itself too seriously, which I think a lot of people aren't getting (hence some extremely scathing reviews on here!)With the exception of Mark Ruffalo, every actor has gotten a chance to explore their characters in a previous movie, which adds to the ""easy-breezy feel"" of the movie. That being said, I thought Mark Ruffalo was a wonderful Bruce Banner -- I'd love to see him in his own movie.The action is non-stop and the CGI is phenomenal. However, this is another case of unnecessary 3D. It's didn't add anything to the effects, except muddle them up on occasion when there was a lot going on. This movie could be shown normally and it would almost be better.Believe the hype. This is an awesome movie. Joss Whedon did an fantastic job with the movie. I can't wait for The Avengers 2."
tt0120815,21 years ago this movie was released and I finally watched it in 2019. I really struggled to watch and I cried and I wept through most of the movie. I did two tours in Nam. This movie was like being back in country. I will never watch it again. It's just eats my guts out.
tt0120737,"I think not.Forgetting for the moment that the movie was mediocre on its own merits there are just tons of differences between the movie and the book which make it laughable to call this an adaptation.From the raping of almost all the major characters, from Saruman to Galadriel, to the sell-out pandering to the big wave of Celtic-love which started with Braveheart, this movie retains none of the character of the original book.  I wouldn't have been surprised if hobbits had been portrayed as eight feet tall, that being a ""valid interpretation"".No, I'm not a purist.  I didn't even finish the first book until after I saw the movie.  I like the book a lot, I didn't see it in the movie.Why are the Hobbits, the most British of the British portrayed as Irish peasants?  Why is Loth Lorien a pit stop on the side of the river?  Why is the wise Council of Elrond arguing with each other like so many Congressmen? So many changes were made, so much needless fluff (like the CGI collapsing staircase scene in Moria and the 30 seconds of ""Whee!  Aren't these two statues almost real?  Take that ILM!"") added.  Do the Jackson apologists really believe what they say, that Jackson read the books and tried to be true to them?For those who say ""It's just a movie"" and I shouldn't rant, doesn't the calculated use of the name Lord of the Rings demand they do the book some justice?  Most of this film's success is due to that name and cashing in on its legacy.  How much money would the film have made if it had been title 'Ring Party', 'Ring Party II', and 'Ring Party III--Revenge of the Short People'?Feh.  A poor effort--or lack thereof."
tt0139414,"Lets get something out of the way so that I can praise this movie properly: Hollywood has a terrible habit of getting the casting wrong. Very wrong. Bill pull-man is a very irritating twit in this movie. As is Bridget Fonda, playing out the pseudo-wannabe feminist. the movie could have easily done without them and so in a strange way, they were just surplus to requirements and added little or no value to an otherwise funny and entertaining movie.I saw this movie a few years ago and just didn't get around to posting a comment then, so I am belatedly offering my 2 pence worth now...The accolades go out to Oliver Platt (Hector Cyr), Brendan Gleeson (the sheriff), Betty White (Delores Bickerman) and Meridith Salenger (the deputy) who carry the movie and make up for what can only be described as distractions by the two so-called leads.Almost from the start, the film is both laugh-out-loud funny (in an intelligent and classy way) and undeniably icky AT THE SAME TIME! The witty repartee between Hector Cyr and the Sheriff is handled splendidly and I strongly suspect that those who gave it bad reviews simply didn't ""get"" the movie. The subject matter is almost irrelevant as it - quite rightly - simply serves as a vehicle for the more interesting of the stories characters."
tt1130884,"I avoided this movie for years

This movie Quickly jumps into the esteemed category being one of the only ones I have watched to score a 10 out of 10.Will enjoy rewatching."
tt7286456,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.
Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.
Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message.
It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too.
The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different.
It's BELIEVABLE.
There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people.
Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film."
tt0109830,"I enjoyed this movie. I thought it gave a lot of meaning about life, and Tom Hanks is a really funny actor in this movie I liked how he talked, it was a good attention getter."
tt1345836,"Disappointed as a viewer. The worst thing a film can do it to make the viewer step out of the film and say ""Give me a break"" If the film interrupts the viewing, it is flawed.Give me a break. Detonation of an atomic bomb off the coast of Gotham? The aftermath: Huge waves, devastation to the city. Radiation fall out for years. The suggestion that Batman is alive is also absurd. He had 5 seconds to detonation and had not dropped the bomb. NO WAY he could have reached any kind of escape velocity. And if his BAT vehicle submerged, which I doubt it did. He could not have survived the radioactivity and heat generated by the blast. This is just stupid writing. The film makers should have resorted to another scenario.Next, the entire police force crowded together in a massive mob heading toward city hall. That is just stupid. It may have worked in an old 1930s movie where UNION workers confronted private police and then fought it out with CLUBS, but to walk into a direct assault of canons? Have we learned nothing since the CIVIL WAR. Battles are not fought that way anymore. The police would have spread out, infiltrated the city hall via underground passages, used ropes to repel from buildings, and overwhelmed the bad guys, not walk in to certain death. The entire attack on city hall was plain stupid. Another example of pulling the viewer out of the film and making him say ""What the Hell?"".In fact, the movie should have been called BATMAN and CATWOMAN. Ann Hathaway was an equal to the Dark Knight and I might say did more to save the city that he did.BANE was a bad dude, psychotic and menacing, but his mask was his Achilles heel. It was much too vulnerable and as such was a stupid idea. If the mask was controlling his pain, he needed to have it protected. All of the punches to his face would have been more than enough to disable this Darth Vader Wannabe. I did like the use of the Sean Connery voice. It added a bit of class the the maniac's demeanor.Also, having a Mideastern villain wanting revenge on Gotham? Old news since 911. Not very original.The film does show how vulnerable modern cities are to terrorism, but DUH! that Old news as well.Bottom Line. Too many flaws in logic and writing for me to really enjoy the film."
tt0111161,"Dont get why is this greatest here, lol ok
but i mean it is a movie after all"
tt0102926,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" deserves its recognition as a classic and one of only three movies in history to win the ""big 5"" Oscars. The protagonists were brilliantly portrayed. Hopkins very much adds to the story through his creepy performance. His articulate speech and refined southern English accent were jarring as he rarely blinked and calmly expressed his cannibalism. The way Lecter masterfully picked at Starling's insecurities while she tried to get his assistance in finding Buffalo Bill made the character all the more terrifying. Foster, unsurprisingly, is extremely believable as a young woman who wants to prove her worth for her future occupation by tackling the ambitious case. The directing flows smoothly. Great use of extreme close-ups are used to see the actors' emotions and connect with them. The flashbacks were introduced before they seamlessly illustrated the effects Lecter's prodding conversations has on Clarice, making these scenes easy to follow and making Foster's character more of a protagonist. On a side note, I appreciated the conscientious effort made to include a diverse cast in the film, with African- Americans featured prominently in important secondary roles. With that being said, I did feel that the movie was not perfect. The way Clarice finds a lead as to where Buffalo Bill is hiding seemed far- fetched to me. I felt the case could have been further developed before Starling reached the conclusion she arrived to. Moreover, I felt that Buffalo Bill could have used more of a back-story than what is given in order to increase the depth of his character. While some insight is given by Lecter, it is not enough to understand what caused the gender/identity issues that drive Bill to kill. This made his character seem a bit two- dimensional as the antagonist of the film. In contrast, I found Lecter's character rich in depth, as he would be considered a bad guy unless he was helping to find another mentally ill murderer. His character does not hold back his psychopathic ways or complete, self-centered disregard for the well- being of others if it doesn't suit his needs. All in all, this was an incredibly well done film that could probably only be improved if not for time restraints."
tt0137523,"I had a lot of expectations for this film but honestly it wasn't bad. I really wasn't gripped or interested by the first half of the film. For me, it was quite boring and too long to build up. I was actually watching it with my brother and Sister and they thought the same and even left the room and didn't finish the film. I finished it of course and like I said I was suprised. The plot twist is interesting, it got me gripped throughout the last 45min. Before that I was going to rate this a 6/10. Regardless of that the film is a bit slow and boring. Overall, it's a pretty good film that I recommend but I think it's kind of overrated."
tt0372784,"Where Memento was psychologically deep and engulfing, Batman Begins is shallow and repetitive. Chris Nolan's breakout masterpiece Memento showed us that he could tell a story that keeps us riveted and constantly guessing through unique editing and story telling techniques. However, Batman Begins flowed poorly. I commend Nolan for not using the quick flashy editing techniques of directors like Guy Ritchie, but his more subdued style failed to engage me. The placement of the flashback sequences were jarring, and failed to move the plot forward in an interesting way.Unlike the Spiderman films, Nolan failed in creating sympathy for both the hero and the villains. The story is a classic battle between good and evil, but I found it too simple. The film attempted to engage us in a good dialog about the reasons for crime and corruption and how poverty is both a symptom and a cause of both. Unfortunately, it was grossly simplified for the sake of mass consumption. I do not believe this is Nolan's fault as I doubt he had final cut status for the film. In general, Hollywood underestimates the intelligence of the movie going public and tends to just throw explosions and nudity at them in place of good plot. Though there was no nudity in this film, I feel that this film did not fulfill it's full potential for the sake of more action. A good discussion about crime and evil would have given Bruce Wayne believable motivation for becoming Batman. The whole ""a burglar shot my parents"" motive could have been done better. I had a hard time empathizing with Bruce Wayne as a result.The acting in the film was as good as the dialog allowed. I always find Liam Neeson's acting rather poor, and this film was no exception. Neeson's character in this was only slightly different from that of his character in Star Wars Episode I. I found his character and the whole ""league of shadows"" very cheesy.In general I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
tt0108052,"I don't know what to say about this movie. I had never seen it, so when I received it this spring I was eager to watch it. I find the subject of the Holocaust to be fascinating (not in a good way) because it's just astounding that this actually happened. It baffles the mind how this could occur on such a grand scale. I'm always watching shows on the history channel about WWII and the Holocaust and so I had very high expectations for this movie. So, I put it in my DVD player and sat down to watch a movie about a subject that I have a lot of interest in. Three hours later I felt as if every ounce of life had been sucked from my body. I was bored to death. I could never get emotionally attached to anyone in the movie. I know this sounds bad but I never felt sorry for anyone in this film. This film felt like it had no real vision or direction and it never bothered to develop any characters; everyone in the movie came across as wooden figures to me.Now comes the real question; should a person watch a movie about the Holocaust expecting to be entertained? Well, the answer to this question is both yes and no. You shouldn't be entertained because it covers such a dark subject but anyone who enjoys history could be entertained because it covers significant event in human history. This where the film fails. It covers the event but it doesn't attempt to make the movie interesting, Spielberg must of decided that the subject matter alone was interesting enough and left it at that.I can watch a show about the Holocaust on the history channel and I will be more emotionally attached to the people in that one hour show than I will be to anyone in that three hour boring film, Schlinder's List. I'm sorry but that's poor execution on Spielberg's part."
tt0108052,"I'm not going to say that this film was boring and black and white is stupid because those things would be wrong. I am part of the group of people who dislike every film Spielberg got his hands on. Spielberg has a way of making the imagery mild entertaining and the story not the least bit compelling. It always has the annoyance through-out his films that just makes me think that he is doing everything wrong. An example of how much I hate his films: I thought Jurassic Park III was a masterpiece compared to Jurassic Park I.Onto the film. This film has quite good cinematography, which is probably the only reason why I kept watching it. As far as the performance of Liam Neeson, I wasn't convinced in the least. Which confused me because he was pretty good in everything else. Also, I read that Billy Wilder wanted to direct it because he had many relatives die in the holocaust. Steven Spielberg turned him down. Now, that just angers me. One, I hate him. Two, that makes him a terrible person. Three, this could've been an even better movie than what PEOPLE think it is right now. I went into this movie with expectations of an average movie. It wasn't that I was extremely let down from what I thought was a masterpiece. I was extremely let down into thinking I was going to be watching an average film.I don't want anyone to think I don't have the attention span or the understanding of films to understand this film. ""Dr. Mabuse, Der Spieler"" is one of my all-time favorites. I'm not going to lie here. I did like the IDEA of the part where Oscar Schindler was going around saying that he could've saved one more life. And I think he dropped to his knees. But the acting Spielberg directed Liam Neeson to do made it worse than it should have been."
tt0133093,"20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels...."

tt0108052,Excellent movie by Spielberg showing the horrors Jews had to go through in World war 2. Full credit to the crew for filming on (near) actual locations and also to the actors for their captivating performances. One of those movies that make you respect human life even more. Definitely recommended.
tt0372784,"A great cast wasted. More Hollywood vacuous tripe. I paid Euro18 to take my 12 year old son to see this and we both came out the cinema shaking our heads in disbelief at the sheer awfulness of it. When will they realise that these comic adaptations just don't work on the big screen. The idea that even in the US, companies exist that spend huge money to develop super weapons that somehow never see the light of day until our leading man comes along to liberate them is so convenient and such a cop out. It insults the intelligence of the audience. Mumbo jumbo pseudo science, hackneyed stereotypes and woeful dialogue. My mother in law is scarier than Cillian Murphy even with the mask on.If you are considering going to see this then think a slightly better version of Daredevil.

tt0133093,"Why does everyone love these movies?  They are junk.  The story is none existent and full of rhetorical nonsense that's randomly placed and stolen from philosophers, the acting is pathetic, and I still believe the only reason people like this movie is because they are hypnotized by its ""dazzling"" special effects.  People consider these ground-breaking special effects...no.  Star Wars was ground-breaking, The Matrix is just people fighting for no reason other than to show off their ""great"" CGI.  I sure hope they don't decide to make a 4th. 3/10 stars."
tt0480025,One of the best and most heartbreaking English movies I've seen! I will never forget what it meant to me the very first time I saw it nor every time I kept revisiting it. Perfect.
tt0133093,"What is THE MATRIX? Well, let me tell you: it's a crowd-pleasing science fiction adventure, which took audiences by surprise as it came out of nowhere and totally destroyed the year's other big sci-fi epic, THE PHANTOM MENACE. The reason for its success is quite obvious when you look at it. The film isn't just about special effects, although they do play a big part; it also has a rather complex and classic sci-fi set up. While STAR WARS was all bad special effects and little else, THE MATRIX is all good special effects and a lot more besides.Okay, so there are some obvious flaws: a lack of originality for one; the real futuristic world looks like something out of BLADE RUNNER and there are bits out of DARK CITY thrown in too. The story, too, once it has been set up, is dropped in favour of some increasingly outlandish action sequences. But when these action scenes are fantastic, then you just don't care. After all, I watch a film to be entertained, and fighting and explosions are the simplest source of entertainment around.The actors and actresses in the film are all okay, although you have to wonder if Carrie-Anne Moss was picked simply because she looks good in PVC. No matter, as it's left to Keanu Reeves in his best role for some time, to carry the film. While he may not be much of an actor (the sheer awfulness of his performance in BRAM STOKER'S Dracula is hard to forget), he just about manages to make his role as a mild-mannered computer operator who becomes a heroic saviour believable. Thankfully, there is some heavyweight support from Laurence Fishburne as the imposing leader of the rebels, and a wonderfully villainous performance from Hugo Weaving as the slimy villain. The costumes are great too - stylish leather and sunglasses making up the main attire.The film is not really about acting, though, or story. It's the special effects which make this, well, special. Without them, it would just be another average tale, but these CGI effects are truly outstanding, even on the small screen. For once, they do fit into the context of the story as well, as they are computer effects in a computer generated world. THE MATRIX has brilliant CGI, and has to join the ranks of TERMINATOR 2, JURASSIC PARK, and INDEPENDENCE DAY as a film which really sets the ever-changing standard on which all other films are to be based.Bullets fly in slow-motion, leaving trails in the air; characters can spin in the air, climb walls and jump huge distances; computer-generated villains morph into other people at will, fights are impossibly fast. Indeed, it is the fight scenes which are the most memorable, as they come across as a hybrid of the classic kung fu genre and the very best of style master John Woo. The best moments are the Fishburne/Reeves training fight, the moment where Reeves takes on Agent Smith in a subway, and the lobby shootout where plaster literally flies everywhere. You also have to love the ending, where Reeves finally wins over the baddies and manages to stop bullets mid-flight with his bare hand. A great image, just one of loads in this great film which has to be one of my favourite sci-fi films of the decade."
tt0645085,Now the writers ran out of local material and need to expand borders... it no longer works
tt7286456,This movie is poorly done as to how it tells the story. It is a dark movie showing the problem of mental illness
tt7286456,"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer. This movie is terrible."
tt0139414,"Don't immediately associate LAKE PLACID with the likes of GODZILLA OR ANACONDA. Although it has some similarities, LAKE PLACID is a hilarious, funny movie with a nice twist at the end.Although Bill Pullman doesn't do much, OLIVER PLATT's character as well as the sheriff's characterisation receive full marks."
tt0816692,"I found Intestellar a beautiful movie to watch and be enthralled by. After countless low grade science fiction movies parading across the screen over the decades, this one will stay with me.The viewer should watch it for story and not for the science - the cinematography is beautiful without being flashy; the acting is brilliant and musical score works perfectly with the story.I was engrossed by the movie from start to finish, held there by the humanity and feeling portrayed by the director and the actors.Why people feel the need to compare Intestellar to Kubrick's 2001 is puzzling - this is a completely different movie and one that, when I think back to watching 2001, is infinitely more watchable.Why people feel the need to pile in rate the movie '1' is beyond me and, at the time of this writing 570,000 people had averaged the rating out to 8.7 - so, don't listen to the hate, just watch it and enjoy."
tt1130884,"I honestly admit I didn't understood the movie,though I watch lots of movies regularly but these is beyond my limits.I never enjoyed it,whole of the whole movie.Greatest disappointment is ending of the movie.Most oftenly Hollywood movies are having positive mood with happy end, where our beloved main lead character wins.Here whole scenario is different.I felt cheated at the end, our hero is the main victim who is being manipulated by rest of the cast. Pace of the movie,another aspect where movie disappoints,sequence of event doesn't keep me on the edge,It was difficult to have attention on the screen.Its better to do anything else than watching these movie"
tt0172495,"""Gladiator"" has a lot to commend it: Awesome fight scenes in the Coliseum, haunting images, and fine (albeit brief) supporting turns by Oliver Reed and Derek Jacobi.  But it's ultimately a three-character movie (Maximus, Lucilla, and Commodfus)and none of those three characters are all that interesting. The ending should be devastating in terms of emotional content, but it just lacks the heart of earlier Roman epics like ""Spartacus"" and even ""Quo Vadis"".  And, despite the lavish computer-generated effects, the film is sorely missing an epic scope.  Contrast Commodus's arrival in Rome with Cleo's spectacular entrance in the '63 ""Cleopatra"".  Maybe the latter film wasn't all that great either, but it captured the scale and pagentry that ""Gladiator"" misses."
tt0120815,"I gave it a vote as high as 3 merely because I believe that on technical merits alone, it was quite good.  However, as far as its entertainment value, it had none whatsoever for me.  I found that I could not see past the violence and gore...  It therefore, as far as I was concerned, had no plot, no character development, no nothing.  Many will disagree with those statements, but note that it's not that the script was without those things, or even that the actors necessarily did a bad job, but simply that the violence was just too strongly present.I remember hearing that the director wanted this to be a movie that would ""show how war really was"".  Well, I've never been in a war, nor do I have any desire to fight.  If this movie gave me the feeling of being in a war, than if I am ever in one, I will become a mindless drone.  I will be almost completely without emotion, my biggest feeling will be one of disgust. I do not feel, though, that this movie has made me feel any differently about war...  I still think it's a horrible thing. The movies that have made me feel more strongly in that direction are those that have drawn me in to the characters lives, and then ripped those lives apart.  Just a few such examples are Platoon and Schindler's List on the serious side, and just as potently Good Morning Vietnam and Life is Beautiful on the comedy side."
tt0848228,"I saw The Avengers on May 17. Personally, I'm not much of a superhero fan, but I quite enjoyed the movie. In my opinion, The Avengers is a pretty good and entertaining movie, and it's a good theatrical experience. James Berardinelli wrote in his review, ""The Avengers kicks ass."" I agree.Over the last few years, five movies have been made - Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, and Captain America - which have built up to, and became prequels to, The Avengers. There were even things in those movies that hinted at them all being connected, and now this movie confirms it. The Avengers are all assembled in this film: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, the Black Widow, and Hawkeye. Yes, they're all played by the same actors, and they have the backgrounds that have been established for most of them in the ""prequels"" mentioned above. The villain in the movie is Loki, who was the villain in Thor, and who now plans on using the Tesseract, a powerful energy cube, to open a portal to another part of the universe and attack the earth with a powerful army. The Avengers are called together by Nick Fury, who runs an agency called S. H. I. E. L. D., and they must stop Loki from carrying out his plans. There's more to the story, but I won't give any more away.I'm sure there are things that can be criticized about the movie. However, it's really not worth it, given there are so many good things about the movie, and the entire experience is very enjoyable, so I'm not going to bother with an in-depth review/criticism. In a way, the film is sort of critic-proof (for lack of a better term). So here's my advice: don't dissect or overly analyze the movie. Just sit back and enjoy it. That's not to say that it's a total Transformers-like junk movie or anything. It's actually halfway decent.The actors put on a good performance and really bring out their characters, and the interactions between the characters are good - the gathering of the different superheroes is handled pretty well. The story is pretty solid, and it's coherent and appropriately paced. The visual and special effects and action scenes are great. Alan Silvestri composed an effective score for the movie. Overall, the movie is halfway decent, it's smart, and it's entertaining, and, unlike many junk films like Michael Bay's, it actually allows for sufficient blockbuster emotional involvement, and it has a good, wise balance between story and action/effects. The two-and-a-half hour running length of the movie pretty much zipped by for me. So, while I don't think this movie is great, it's definitely entertaining and worth seeing, and it's a very good theater experience.My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)"
tt0172495,Seriously the best fantasy film of the modern area with great acting and emotional rollercoastering all the way through. The soundtrack by Zimmer really propels this film
tt7286456,Heath Ledger occupies the screen for a fraction of the time that Joaquin Phoenix does but is by far the finest villain in at least Batman but I'd say one of the best performances ever. I just don't get why laughing hysterically and randomly at anything requires an Oscar. Batman is and loved by people without having to tell the story of the joker.
tt0361748,"First of all, I am really an admirer of early Tarantino movies. I strongly suggest that everyone who didn't watch ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" do so. No lack of violence there also. Rest of his movies could easily be skipped although ""Kill Bill"" has some moments. This is my first review here and I am writing it because I am so disappointed in the movie and in the direction this author is going. I suppose the great reviews and rating of this movie is caused by new generation of movie goers admiration of pure gore and exaggeration. There is definitely not much left from the original artistic freshness and mastery in somewhat artificial (deliberately) but certainly intelligent and fluent Tarantino style dialogue. I am giving it 3 out of 10, because there are still some movies worse than this one."
tt7286456,"This film tries desperately to devillify the most stylish and charismatic villain in the DC universe and excruciatingly transform him into a poster child for mental illness in the most tedious manner possible.. This version of the Joker lacks any semblance of style, luster, flair, or charisma, leaving me to wonder why anyone would bother investing the time and money required to create this turkey, much less watch it.They've murdered the Joker for the sake of some social commentary and PC promotion. I don't deny that mental illness is a real issue or that attention should be brought to it, but folks watch movies about supervillians to see super-villainy, not a 2 hour public service announcement. I hung in there as long as I could hoping for this movie to redeem itself, but about 3 quarters of the way through I could take no more of watching it spin it's wheels.If you are a fan of the Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger versions of the Joker then you will likely find this film as painful to watch as I did."
tt0133093,"'The Matrix' is a film about the concept of reality and identity. The lead character is transformed into an alternate world through the help of Morpheus, and he learns to battle the machines. This is a very deep film, and it is one that will make you think about life and reality. It's also a film that can be watched multiple times. One of the best areas of this film is the use of special effects in the battle scenes where the cameras rotate fully around the action. This is the highlight of the film, and without that, it would be almost like any other science-fiction/action movie. In my opinion, the story and characters are a little bit weak, but the concept and the special effects make this movie well-worth a watch."
tt0268200,An exceptionally well done portrayal of depravity in a Mormon context. Richard Dutcher does en excellent job of acting and directing.
tt1853728,"OK!! We get it! Tarantino has that second degree and his movies don't have to be taken literally and he did bring a whole new genre to cinema, and the technique and the music is amazing, and the actors are good, and the image is good, but... At what point does all of this just become a lame excuse to do another violent movie filled with clich√©s and empty of content. Really???? This is a movie about slavery?? It seems to me that it is in fact yet another bullshit excuse to portray spectacular killings for numb-minded viewers who can only expect this from a movie. Nothing makes sense in this movie, absolutely nothing. And it is the same as all the last Tarantino babies. It is better then kill bill and Inglorious Bastards, but what isn't? And overall it they are all exactly the same. Is there nothing else we can expect? Is this all folks? After almost a century of cinema we did everything there was to be done? Now we will repeat ourselves over and over again? If you haven't yet cached my drift i am extremely disappointed and this is probably the last Tarantino movie I will watch."
tt0848228,"I have never reviewed anything here on IMDb but after watching the Avengers for the second time I just felt the need to say something.Very well, after watching the Avengers in the cinema you don't reflect very much of the bad things, it's all special effects and 3D stuff going on. But after watching this alone at home, I just felt it's not that good. The story is clich√© as many has mentioned, but I felt that there are a few things that are unclear.I just can't figure out how strong are the asgardians, they are supposedly demi-gods. Still the hulk threw Loki around like nothing, I just felt that scene was unnecessary. I don't want the bad-guy to look so crappy. I just couldn't take Loki seriously he got tossed around a lot. Don't get me wrong I enjoy some of the humor added to this film, it's just sometimes it's not timed right it just seems wrong to me.The most annoying part about The Avengers is that the Bad Guys didn't stand a chance. And I didn't like Loki for being a bad guy again."
tt0361748,"Read on before you complain!I am a fan of Tarantino, so why give Basterds a middling rating, a score similar to such non-classics as Big Man Japan and Silent Hill?Well after the initial scene there just aren't any scenes that ""pop"" or are worthy of a zippy description.IB just isn't as intricate and tricky as I think it wants to be, so we are left with a movie with long drawn out scenes, not enough dialogue worthy of note and insufficient action to fill in the lengthy gaps. I think Tarantino felt this might become known as ""the one where some Jewish guys have a crack at Hitler"".As mentioned the best scene in IB is the first with all the hallmarks of a Tarantino special. In essence it is a German soldier politely but forcefully interrogating a Frenchman who he believes to be harbouring Jews, so I'll leave the description at that, because Tarantino makes it so much more that trying to describe it in more detail would be pointless.In broad terms though it has crackling dialogue, the tension builds throughout and the scene is allowed to play out over about 20 minutes, where other directors might give it 3, get to the payoff and move on.In Chapter Two we meet the Basterds ‚Äì in another example of ""taking their word for it"", as we are informed that the Basterds are an elite team of vicious, mostly Jewish, soldiers hellbent on killing as many Nazis as possible and striking fear into enemy ranks.We are introduced to a couple of Basterds, a German named Hugo Stiglitz who is infamous and feared (again because we are told so) and the ""Bear Jew"", a man who carries a baseball bat and beats his victims to a bloody pulp, but mostly they remain a faceless bunch headed by one Bradley Pitt - you might have heard of him.Speaking of baseball bats, in the real life game of ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" I'd take a machine gun over a baseball bat every time. What does the Bear Jew do in combat, hang in the background until someone runs out of bullets? Or wait until a German soldier shows up with a club or bat so it is a fair fight? Seems a pretty inadequate weapon 99% of the time.We are given a couple of examples as to how the Basterds work, and EVERYONE has seen the speech Aldo Raine (Pitt) gives to his squad applicants, ""And I want my scalps!"" but they just don't seem that scary or menacing really. Nonetheless (because the plot says so) their reputation gets all the way to Mr Hitler himself, who deems them trouble enough that he takes time out of running a conflict involving several million soldiers to consider how he might deal with them.The remaining Chapters involve events that bring the main combatants into close proximity so that we might have some sort of climax to the film. In this case a Nazi propaganda film is to be premiered in a small French cinema, with many German dignitaries in attendance, including a man with an abbreviated mustache.This gives a small window of opportunity for assassins to kill most of the Nazi war machine in one crack, thereby ending the war (apparently). At least in this circumstance Tarantino didn't think small! Of course it leaks out that the premiere is happening and the British intelligence formulate a plan to bring in the Basterds and have them meet with a liaison to crash the premiere and do what they do best.Need I mention at this point we are about an hour and 40 minutes into the film, and the titular Inglourious Basterds have two on screen kills? Seems a little light in a war movie when they are the most feared soldiers in the entire war doesn't it? This movie isn't overlong, just ""over-nothing-worthwhile-happening"". I can sit through 2 and a half hours standing on my head if the movie justifies it, but I can't say that Inglourious Basterds gave me sufficient reward for my time, let alone ""Bang"" for my buck. There were almost more rounds fired in the standoff at the conclusion of Reservoir Dogs! Nazi Colonel Hans Landa, as the ""Jew Hunter"", is the best thing in the film and it is no surprise that he gets the best dialogue. The scenes in which he features provide some tension and menace that is not really tangible for the remainder of the film.As mentioned before the Basterds are largely under-utilised but that is also reflective in the fact that they are soldiers and this is a movie largely without battles and action.Tarantino sticks to his guns though and IB is again a movie made solely on his terms, the long drawn out scenes (many of them boring), considerable use of subtitles - even a bizarre section with a voice-over by Samuel L. Jackson for some reason - the music at times is also way too contemporary for a WW2 film, and if I bagged 300 for that then I must definitely point it out here.I think it's interesting that Tarantino chose to plot his film in an alternate version of WW2, because in an alternate universe Inglourious Basterds would have far more action and be a far superior film.Final Rating ‚Äì 6.5 / 10. As a director Tarantino aims for ""cool"" above all else. This just ain't that cool, regardless of what the sweaty palmed fanboys think.P.S. When I looked to IMDb to make sure I spelt a couple names right I saw that IB is currently in the top 100 ranked films of all time. This is surely just a sad joke.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"
tt0480820,"Karateka leaves you with the impression that the game was an experiment. Almost a prototype of what was to be seen in the first consoles after the '82 video game crash. The characters were amazingly fluid for their time, in some ways superior to the stick-figure sprites seen in 8-bit consoles. Karateka is the earliest example I can think of that uses modern cut-scenes - and uses them effectively. The game probably taxed hardware of its time a little too much: the lags in game play were terrible. It might have played much better on later hardware such as the Macintosh, NES, or a 286 PC. I doubt any original copies exist on magnetic media. Since the game is well over 20 years old, the data on original media has long since decayed. I did find a disk image recently to play on my Mac using an Apple II emulator and was overwhelmed with a wave of nostalgia. If you get a chance, check out a fan film called Karateka II, a very silly although somewhat buggy parody."
tt0422272,Another example of a film that should have been a blockbuster hit or at least well known. Here it is 2022 and I've never heard of it and EXTREMELY glad we watched it. Brilliant film in every aspect including the beautiful cinematography and the location of the film especially the spooky hospital. The cast is fantastic not 1 weak cast member and we loved the story and even the ending. You have to see this IT'S AN ABSOLUTE MUST SEE!!!!
tt0422272,"This was, by far, one of the WORST movies I have ever watched. There was nothing scary about this movie except for the deadpan acting. If this movie was a person, I'd be in jail for choking the life out of it...that is how bad it is!! I have absolutely no idea how it got so many high ratings. Don't waste your time watching it....seriously."
tt0102926,"I was not impressed with this film, and it's phoney psychiatry. I have some professional experience in working with the criminally insane, in the US and UK. While there are a few staff in the profession who would allow themselves to be manipulated in the way that Clarice Starling does, I cannot conceive any real life situation where so many of her colleagues would allow this situation, known as ""team splitting"", to continue. It is routine behaviour for psychopaths to attempt to team split, as Lekter does, but it is such a standard ploy that it would be recognised in any institution other than the toyland one in the film and quickly dealt with, and I resent the attitude of the storyline in glorifying this behaviour. Trust me people, if you are in this situation, don't allow patients to split you away from your colleagues, you may think they are interested in you but they will get bored with playing with you in the end. When patients are given this power, which they cannot handle, it makes them more scared, and less likely to learn. In his attempt to make Frederick Chilton, the character that should be the good guy, in to the bad guy, either the actor or the director has gone way over the top, to the point where where pathos becomes bathos, and as for Anthony Hopkins, he lost all credibility for me when he announced in a British tabloid that he was sorry for seeming to condone violence in the role he was playing, and then within a few months proceeded to repeat the role in the sequel, ""Hannibal"". That's why I never bothered to see the film until just recently."
tt0111161,Nice movie...............................................................................................
tt0109830,"Make a movie about a retard, or play one. Look at Hoffman in ""Rainman"" or Miles in ""Ryan's Daughter"", they won Oscars for playing retards too. You can't go wrong with a stupid person as the focus, sort of like the chimp lead. Better yet, endow him with all sorts of savant-like talents like superhuman strength and sports agility. What silly, contrived hokum. This is a sentimental piece of schlock that is always simple and forced. ""Life is like a box of chocolates"", yeah, right! The only one who deserved the Oscar lost, Gary Sinise. Finally, use cgi to work the retard into all the key TV/pop culture moments, guaranteed to melt a boomer's heart. Have him influence the whole world with his simple homespun Gomer Pyle platitudes. If the director had another 10 minutes to fill, Gump would have redesigned the Apollo space ship program and got the astronauts to the Moon. Enough sugar here to rot our whole country's teeth. It proves that pop culture really sucks. ""Pulp Fiction"" was it's dark Oscar nominated rival in 1994. It was a better movie with a sicker message so it lost to this treacle,"
tt0172495,"Too bad...I was hoping for a revival of Roman Gladiator Greats.Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" is not all that it's cracked up to be. Although most of the action sequences are astounding, the dialogue is so awful that each time a character says something it sounds like nails on a chalkboard.  How many times did someone say ""I will have my vengance!""?  5 times, by my count.  Gladiator has lots of scenes devoted to character depth, but no real person would talk in as many cliches as these people do.Another Gripe: The movie is much longer than it needs to be.  If the last hour (of its 155 minute running time) was to be cut off, absolutely none of the plot would change!  The plot is supposed to thicken in the last hour, but that never happens because every interesting scenes which surfaces is shot down by cheesy dialogue; every scene which starts promisingly falls flat on its face.  I suggest cutting out 50 of the last 60 minutes and putting the ending in sooner.A few highlights: The fighting scenes in the ring truly are amazingly staged, if over-gory, and the opening battle is a delight.  Finally, Russell Crowe does try hard to rise above the script, and his performance would have been memorable if he had some actual material to explore.I say ""Gladiator"" is only for those of you with three hours and eight bucks to burn.  Otherwise, go rent Ben-Hur, even though you need four (well-spent) hours for that one. Grade: C-"
tt0468569,"This movie is a non-plot action-packed propaganda movie. Which wouldn't be so bad but the combination is such that it IS the worst movie I have ever seen in my whole life. Seriously, when I came out of the movie theatre I was sick and angry at the same time. The whole movie is about approach towards the various kinds of villains, how they are and how they should be generally handled. You have about twenty propaganda lines, towards which each part of the film leads, those parts connected by a very feeble link. You could almost see the authors as they thought, hmm, we need to put this line into the movie, what circumstances will lead the hero or antihero to tell the audience this truth? Of course that made the movie a two hour drag where the twists and turns of fortune made you think if it wasn't a 10yr old child who wrote it. Ha, the setup worked we caught the Joker. Oh, Joker escaped, what are we gonna do? Then the good guys would realize that Joker wanted them to set up a trap, he wanted to be caught so as to get ..., escape and harm even more. Well, that is so childishly ridiculous, first surrealistic propaganda movie ever.So guys out there in the US remember. When you get spied through your cell phones, when your dear ones die in stead of a rich undercover agent, don't feel offended. Because to fight the ""crime"" or ""terrorism"", we don't need the good heroes (those apparently end up as dead half-faced wackos). We need dark knights. Sorry for my bad English. I needed to get this off my chest. So much approval, 9.2 user rating here, 94% on rottentomatoes, are that many people so simple or so easily bought?"
tt0361748,"I saw the trailer and thought this movie would be fun. I knew I was in trouble at the opening scene where the visiting Nazi has a long chat with the farmer. I'd say 90% of this movie is long irrelevant chats in restaurants and other rooms. I mean who cares? This was advertised as a fun action-packed war movie about crazy guys that kill Nazis. Instead you get a snooze fest.Every now and then I'd think ""OK now we're going to get to the good stuff. He's been torturing us so we'll really enjoy the good stuff"". But you know what? There was no good stuff. Sure there was a few war porn moments, but nothing that got me really engaged in the flick.Gratuitous violence is part of a Tarantino movie experience. So I was not surprised to see it. But somehow it just seemed adolescent. It added nothing to the story. The military does have a command structure and they don't let their soldiers carve people up like a Thanksgiving goose for fun. This was the 2nd World War where the Allies were actually good guys.I must admit after seeing numerous Hitler parodies on YouTube I'm rather spoiled. Every actor that plays Hitler must measure up to the YouTube parody version. This one does not.And the ending - f'ing retarded. Like a frustrated cinema owner could bring down the entire Third Reich. The thing is so full of holes you'd think the Nazis were complete amateurs that couldn't guard an outhouse."
tt0102926,"Rewatched February 27th, 2021A favorite of mine for years and a worthy Beat Picture winner at the Oscars, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins give the performances of their careers. Now whether or not you agree with category placement for Hopkins, which I've for years agreed as leading due to importance to plot but after this viewing I'm actually seeing it more as supporting, his along with Foster's are Oscar deserving performances. Ted Levine is also incredible as Buffalo Bill and was deserving of awards attention but sadly did not. The screenplay by Ted Tally had incredible dialogue especially between Foster and Hopkins and allowed them to showcase their talents. The film would not have been as successful without masterful direction by Jonathan Demme. As far as techs go, editing is top notch. It's no surprise to see that the costume design was completed by 12 times Oscar nominated with 4 wins Colleen Atwood, because her work combined with the production design by Kristi Zea and Karen O'Hara brings magic to the screen captured by the exquisite cinematography of Tak Fujimoto."
tt7286456,"Just watched this last night, succumbing to all the incredible press that's been surrounding the film lately, and I have to say, I was a bit underwhelmed.First off, does no one remember THE DARK KNIGHT (2008) and Heath Ledger's legendary turn as Joker? Did we really need yet another take on who Batman's arch nemesis is? Although he was quite amazing in an extreme and dedicated performance, I never really felt like I wasn't watching Joaquin Phoenix do some really good acting, vs. seeing the character of Joker emerge from the tortured individual of Arthur Fleck. Yes, his character changed and grew throughout the film, but it was always Joaquin Phoenix I felt like I was watching. Ledger's immersive performance made me forget the actor entirely, seeing only the insane character of Joker throughout. Personally, I feel like I would've responded better had this movie been something other than an origin story, where Phoenix's portrayal would've been able to expand upon Joker's character (perhaps w/flashbacks to his origin). In this way, the established standard presented by Ledger could have been built upon - and even morphed into further (and greater) complexity - rather than feeing like a different take on the same character. Which gets me to my second point...In my view, one of the main problems with the DC universe that Marvel has overcome is the constant need to reinvent itself, rather than build upon an established world that continues to expand through character and story (yeah, I know they're trying - but it ain't workin'). Although a completely new take, with no ties to the existing DC cinematic universe and no intention of further exploration via sequels, JOKER feels like an attempt at making something remarkable that's kinda sorta part of the DC cinematic universe (no, really it's not), but kinda sorta misses the mark. The entire film has a look-at-how-incredible-and- different-I-am vibe that I just could not shake. And, yes, in some ways JOKER is incredible and different. But it's not currently tied to any other part of the DC cinematic universe, nor is it intended to be. So, as a standalone venture, the film becomes nothing more than a harsh, gritty, depressing throwback to other great films like TAXI DRIVER or THE KING OF COMEDY (which might explain why Robert De Niro finds himself in a throwaway role in this film).Lastly... The depiction and use of excessive and gratuitous violence in this day and age, for me, demonstrates an inability to avoid old and tired tropes in favor of more unnerving approaches to filmmaking that isn't so much ""in your face"" with longer lasting effects. Let's be honest: societally, we're so aware of and numbed by the depiction of gun violence on the screen that it has absolutely no punch anymore for most people. Hence the feeling of gratuitousness it brings when seeing it, once again, depicted in all it's violent glory. Joker is a character who, at a minimum, is a master agent of chaos, and this film almost gets that - but not quite. Instead, the focus goes more toward the flashy extravagance of the violence, which screams so loudly at us from the screen that we only catch a glimpse of the character's deeper motives (and satisfaction at achieving them) by the end of the film.Is JOKER a bad film that should be avoided at all cost? No - far from it. But this viewer honestly does not understand why it's garnered all the incredible buzz it's been receiving of late. JOKER is simply another decent film that could've been so much more than it is."
tt0172495,"Great Story!  Great Writing!  Great Acting!  Great Directing!  Great Score! This movie has it all.  I especially enjoyed the mood of the film.  Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style.  The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations.  Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the ""general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor.""  Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus.  Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine.  It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla.  However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles.  Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers.  Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators.  The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the ""thrill of the Coliseum"" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate.  The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene.  But the whole movie is a rush!  Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie.  Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing.  I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages.  Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time!"
tt0110912,"The movie is a classic, without a doubt. Its very entertaining and features fantastic acting and writing. The movie however, does not have the most powerful meaning its more something that you watch for fun. I must also admit that Quentin Tarantino's style is not my cup of tea. However, I still have to respect the ingenuity of which this film has been made."
tt1345836,"Don't waste your money, The Dark Knight was terribly awesome, every scene in that film as stand alone is better than this film.It was overcrowded with characters, half of whom don't really add to the story, while taking up valuable screen time of the main characters. It missed Batman, this was essentially a film about Bruce Wayne and his problems. The story isn't just about good versus evil (which worked great in The Dark knight and helps focus the film's plot) but wants to explore all kinds of societies problems such as the stock market, evil bankers ('I have my money under the mattress' (""you evil bankster"") and Occupy. Rather then exploring these themes thoroughly it just touches them and then moves on forgetting all about it. Further more, the action is really, really weak! This is a big issue for me since I love action movies, maybe other people will not care as much. But the fighting scenes between Batman and Bane are laughable. Just hitting each other in slow motion, my god, the guy threatens to kill 12 million people but Batman adheres to his code?? It worked great in The Dark Knight, since the Joker was essentially creating chaos, not direct annihilation of a city, but in this film it is totally out of context. That scene where 300 cops run into a fortified position of bad guys armed with AK-47's? OH REALLY?! Where were Batman's gadgets? Not the overblown helicopter thing (my god what an inconspicuous piece of engineering) but the subtle stuff, the smoke, the batclaw, whatever. Just like 007 missing Q, it just doesn't work. They had to repeat some amazing turn with his bike twice in the film just to show something reasonable interesting in the way of action, in Avengers this would have been in the background, once. Blurred. The stadium scene. Mehh, seen it already seventy times in the trailer. Oh.. The film drags on for an amazing 165 minutes! They would have had a better film cutting it with 60 minutes. It would have helped them focus and cut unnecessary scenes (alot you say? Yes!).But the biggest problems with this film is the random stuff that completely sucks:Openingscene: kidnap that doctor? OK. huh whats with the tube and the blood, ehm why do only Bane and that guy hang there after it crashes down when moments before there were like 6 bad guys in the plain on ropes? Huh oh never mind next scene!Why why WHY does Bane hate batman so much? It is insinuated for most of the movie that Batman killed his father, but in the end it shows Bane has no real connection to Batman what so ever? Strange..And that prison/dark pit, in which no sunlight ever shines? ITS LIT UP WITH THE SUN THE ENTIRE FILM!Why do they keep talking on ice where everybody who steps foot on it falls through and dies? Thanks for saving me, lets continue the talk over there where we won't DIE?Yeah let's kill the bad guy, not by batman but a support character, introduce the real villain, and kill her in a car crash 5 minutes later. And damnnnnn the acting in that scene deserves a razzie.Better love story than twilight!Yes Batman, everybody knows you are Bruce Wayne, you can start talking normal, saves you the cough the day after.Bane.. ? Like three people SAY Bane is amazing big etc. But as a viewer, you don't see it, you just don't feel the menace, nothing. Because Bane isn't AT ALL MENACING OR BIG OR SCARY!! His voice, what a failure. Born in the Darkness! .. 140 minutes later, oh no, he wasn't? Or was he? No matter, he's dead. Let's not mention him again in the rest of the film.Robin. Don't get me started. SAVE THE CITY! EXODUS! DRIVE A BUS WITH 15 CHILDREN TO THE BRIDGE AND FAIL IN GETTING THEM ACROSS HAHAHAHAHAHA!Lucius Fox was in this movie?Let's insinuate that Bane's goones are terrible and so committed and 'where does he get these guys?' Oh lets not explain that, lets move on to some surgeon in a prison in a foreign country, whos story we don't CARE ABOUT! AT ALL! PEETIME!Government does not negotiate with terrorists! Next scene, 'they made a deal!' SighEtc"
tt0507159,"A deep undercover US agent, Vladimir Rostoff has been operating inside the Soviet Union for over 20 years. He has found out that Soviet scientists have developed a lethal nerve agent that kills anyone exposed to it at an instant.Rostoff steals the serum and contacts Archangel to help get him and his family back to the USA especially as he killed his fellow scientists to steal the serum. His family are unaware that he is an undercover agent and are reluctant to leave. Archangel is unsure whether to trust him after all these years inside the Soviet Union.Hawke and Santini mount a rescue effort by flying into Russia, but due to the vast distance they need to cover, Airwolf is stripped of its weapons leaving Hawke to fly low in low light to evade Russian radars.There is a nice orange light depicting a sunset scene as Archangel waits for the rescue mission to be a success. Hawke shows a little shade to his character as he tells Rostoff's family that life in the USA is not all bad and they do have a choice to live whatever life they want."
tt0993846,"Plot is moving very slow and boring. Most of actors overact. Only Margot does acting naturally. It may be help if this can be shorten to 80-90 mins, removing those too dramatized screens."
tt0109830,"Forrest Gump is one of those movies where you can't really say you didn't like it without being criticized. Unless if you can back it up without some reasoning, excluding the term overrated. That just sounds like a lazy reason to most people, and even though I think it is overrated, I would still ask other people why they think it is overrated because I'm just a curious person. The response overrated is just disappointing for real but not professional movie critics like me.First off, Forrest's accent is over-exaggerated and obnoxious to hear for an 2 hour and a half movie. Imagine hearing it the theatres where the sound of his goofy and ridicules Alabama accent is pounding in my head. The only accent I liked in this movie was Bubba. In fact that will be my next point as to why I didn't like the movie too much:The movie moves off the characters too fast, as if they are all expendable characters in Family Guy and the character development is weak, narration explaining most of the characters choices instead of showing the choices that they make. This movie had mostly tell, not show. Hell, I could barely tell why he even liked Jenny in the first place. He just said I love you, I write to her all the time, i miss you jenny, marry me jenny. Then even worse, he tells us why he likes Jenny, instead her showing those personality traits herself.Granted, there was one instance in the movie where it Did actually show his love for her instead of telling it, which was when she got punched and he punched the guy back, and he told her that no one should hit her and that he would never hit her. That was my favorite part of the movie, but that's not even the most famous scene of the movie for some reason. That brings up another thingThe most famous and heard of scene is the scene when Jenny says ""Run, Forrest, Run"" Seriously? It was in the first 10 minutes of the movie, and they were still little kids when most of the movie was jumping from historical scene to the next one. The scene did not have emotional meaning to me, the phrase sounds more of a meme than anything else. Also, what made the scene even more overrated was when he started outrunning the bikes and all that crap. It just made the scene even more unbelievable and unrelatable. Now this whole running junk was redeemable when he went back to go save Bubba because he was my favorite character, but when I was watching the scene for the first time I was rolling my eyes.Still, I gave it a seven because even though the historical scenes were narrated and had no point to the plot at all except to show he's been everywhere, it was still mostly funny and showed his goofy personality and it was nice to see historical figures interact with an idiot and see their reactions.And the crippled guy who I will not bother looking up was a great redemption story character, although I thought his subplot story was more interesting than Forrest's love life, and I wish that they could have added more to it. Like, how did he score some hookers? I wish it would have explained that to me because I can't see why they would be interested in a cripple. Unless they were paid like a normal prostitute, but I don't remember the movie explaining them as prostitutes.Soundtrack was good, particularly ""Freebird."" Although the scene where it played it did not really match to what was going on and it was kind of confusing to me why they needed it then. Sweet Home Alabama is one of my most overrated and overplayed songs, and whenever I hear it I groan and complain. It's just so annoying!I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to somebody who wants to watch a famous movie, because I would recommend other movies like The Dark Knight or Requiem For A Dream or Donnie Darko or Silence of The Lambs but I can totally see other people recommending Forrest Gump. My advice would be, go check the movie out if you want to, and my opinion on this movie isn't as common as most people.7/10."
tt7286456,"Jaquin Phoenix is amazing as always and New York looks pretty good, but everything else....The plot is very contrived and pretty much a mess. Aiming more for shock value than smart, interesting or even a coherent story. It's another bad depiction of mental illness, with nothing interesting to say.
If you weren't paying attention, don't worry. You'll get a recap of the whole movie at the end by Jaquin Phoenix.This movie is just a copy and an imitation of better movies mashed together and slapped with the ""Joker"" name and ""Warner Brothers"" logo. For people who have not seen ""Taxi Driver"", ""The King of Comedy"" and other better movies.Its called ""Joker"" just because if it wasn't nobody would see/like this and nobody would care. The script was probably done before deciding that this is a ""Joker"" movie. By only changing the name and the makeup you could call it anythin. You could call it ""Chaplin"" or ""Mr. Bean"" or ""Dracula"" or whoever because it doesn't matter....Todd Philips probably wanted to remake ""Taxi Driver"" but Warner Brothers only gave mone for a ""DC"" movie so.....(This sentence was censored by your friendly neighborhood IMDb) Are you happy now?Not worth a watch"
tt0848228,"Despite the ridiculous overrating of 8.2 out of 10 stars on this site at the time of this review, there are some pretty good negative reviews on here. A number of people seem confused why this film is considered good or even outstanding, and they should be confused. Generally, I'm confused why people are so impressed by this type of film over and over. It is simple-minded, predictable, boiling over with clich√©s, ugly to look at, lacking character development, and overblown in just about every way. It really isn't worth the time for a full review, particularly in light of some good ones here already. I'll just list some flaws that I think most people are not acknowledging.--This film is overly long. It's 2 hours and 22 minutes. A popcorn comic book movie shouldn't make your butt and bladder hurt this much.--The pacing of this film is uneven. You expect this type of film to be packed with mindless action, but it had a lot of inexplicable lulls. I thought the dull section of the film on the floating ship would never end. The set up also took way too long and was uninteresting.--This movie spends a lot of time on the pop psychology of its heroes as well as the psychology of their group dynamic. This becomes dull and tiresome, yet for the time spent on it we still get cardboard cutouts.--Why is the story fueled by the Thor story line, the most outlandish and inane of the Marvel tales (close second for Captain America)? Loki is a silly, petty villain. It is hard to relate to any of these heroes, as they all seem inexplicably immortal, but the whole Norse God/Space Alien thing with Thor and Loki perhaps should have been swept under the rug. Maybe there is some sort of comic book tradition reason for this choice?--This movie looks bad. It is ugly and fake looking. There is way too much CGI that isn't even required by the special effects demands of a scene. The action scenes have a numbing effect after a little while and it becomes easy to forget you aren't watching a video game.--This film is fueled by clich√©s of every kind. It feels like a used, third hand piece of writing.--There are some good actors in this film (and some not so good) but they aren't given enough space to spread their wings. The script is also a heavy yoke these actors must try to preform under the restriction of.--I felt nothing watching this film other than mild irritation. I don't expect a huge emotional impact watching this type of film. That's not why I see this type of movie. Still, I found it strangely empty. It is basically as if the filmmakers have put their focus on all the wrong aspects of their craft. The film quickly ceases to be fun for me, in part because it is so empty.--I think it also feels empty because it has a 'going through the motions' type feel to it. The plot is one of unsubtle inevitability. 2 hours and 22 minutes is a long film, but it feels much longer if there are few if any surprises, and the basic arc of the plot is so polished that it feels like a one hump roller coaster.--A blockbuster superhero action film isn't really about subtlety, nor should it be. But this film lacks any moral gray, or tense emotion fueled by uncertainty. It replaces any emotion with bald faced sentiment. And while it is filled with tiny details and references, its themes are mind numbing, characters thin (even if you've seen all the Marvel films) and storytelling cluttered, but full of unimaginative sequences.--This film is slick. It is a formula that is well greased and polished to a blinding shine. And it is tough to make a film that is presented in this smooth, flashy, yet non-stylistic sort of way. But this confidence of the filmmakers wears on me. It feels like the polish of the film makes it feel more plastic than it needs to, and guts any chance of the film having a soul. And the immense machine that is this film and this series has become so smooth and over confidant that it really does not feel the need to be interesting in any way... like in a way a lot of cheap, low budget and unambitious movies are. It is a plague of our age of filmmaking.--Remember when a blockbuster used to be something like Jaws?"
tt0114369,"That was one of the most boring and predictable movies I've ever seen.It's extremely slow, dialogue is clunky and unbelievable and the characters are just the clich√® hothead and the stoic ""I just wanna do my work"" old cop. Throughout the movie they develop absolutely no chemistry.I saw Tracy's death coming from the very first time we saw her. It was way too obvious.The very last few minutes were quite good, but the rest was just utter garbage. Also probably Brad Pitts worst performance I've seen."
tt0120737,"It's hard for me to comment too badly on this movie.  It's a fantasy movie. It's supposed to take you away into another world, away from your real crappy lives and entertain you.  If you want literature, read the book. If you want 400+ pages of character development, read the book.  There's the movie and the book.  They serve the same purpose through different mediums; one's better equipped to grab you around the neck and shake you around for a few hours, while the other will gently caress and nourish your mind over the course of several days.No movie based on a book, especially a book of this stature, will EVER live up to the expectations.  ""The Exorcist"" or ""The Godfather"" or ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" are examples of near perfection, in my opinion, but I'm sure there are those that disagree.Then, there's ""Starship Troopers""Just consider this last example.  What a horrible piece of crap that movie was.  It barely resembled the book past the title.  And the movie was horrible to boot!  Just imagine Casper Van Dien as Aragorn and Denise Richards as Arwen.  Directed by Paul Verhoven.I'm getting sick just from the thought of it.  See how great this movie really was, or at least how bad it COULD have been.  I appreciate it more already.I've been exposed to the Lord of the Rings books and stories and cartoon incarnations as long as I can remember.  I couldn't find many faults with this version, but after reading others' reviews, I could believe that if you weren't familiar with the stories that you might not have enjoyed it as much as I did.In the near 180 minutes that this movie spanned, there could have been a little less pointless CGI and a little more about the history of those involved, for the sake of those not familiar with the story.  In general, though, I'd have to say that the CGI didn't get in the way of the story half as much as it would have in some other director's hands."
tt0167261,"From the beginning to the very end, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is interesting and enjoyable. The books and the movies alike grasp one's attention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sense the pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is truly powerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has something the first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two great islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be described. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. The third movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made."
tt0068646,"I expected a lot of this film especially after this was ranked as one of the best films. But to give it #1 ranking is way too much. I watched it and it was an OK film. The portrayal was real but a little too slow at times. Reality they say bites and I guess it was more like a documovie that chronicles the life of a mafia and his family. Facts were not the problem here, the speed was. I could find little that was debatable or something like that, just that it made me sleep. The sequel was no better in working as a sleeping pill."
tt0372784,"""Batman Begins"",praised and paraded by the critics BUT if nothing else this movie proves as a fine example of just how wrong they can be. Although the movie was original and interesting in places it generally gave the feeling of never really beginning,as if something was just about to happen......but it never did.(ha ha,rather ironic as I look to the title now). Christian Bale was well cast as the moody beginner in the batman suit but the general atmosphere of the movie was a disappointment and ruined a potentially interesting character.Michael Caine was the only light relief from the depressingly moody and overly dramatic sequences with other characters. That girl from Dawsons Creek (insert name here) was positively cringe worthy trying to play a character who is strong and deep,when really all the audience can concentrate on is her misshapen teeth,scarily thin waist and stomach churning squeaky voice. The movie poorly endeavours to give a more realistic feel to the franchise yet still indulges in many fantastical moments,and I feel the two aspects don't gel well. Unlike Burtons triumphs with his Gothic style but believable back stories,this movie tells us too much but provides little in the way of action,humour or visual fun. Furthermore the ""Villain"" who proved as a camp,menacing monster in Burtons movies,with fine examples such as the Joker and Catwoman,""Batman Begins"" excuses consists of a camp busy-body who occasionally dons a filthy mask,wails for a while,and calls himself the scarecrow from time to time,who is then defeated quicker than a foot to a cockroach,he is poorly seconded by an ageing warrior type figure who is about as menacing,frightening or indeed interesting as a fat ginger cat. The only promising aspects of the movie,were the simple style costume which was a welcome return from the suit with nipples which made us all cringe in batman and robin,the heart warming and believable relationship with Bruce and Alfred,and indeed Bale himself.But to all those of you who were left laughed out and awestruck by Burtons dark camptastic masterpieces this movie will certainly disappointed,and now I shall finish on that very note,shamelessly screaming and howling at the top of my voice BRING BACK BURTON!!!"
tt1345836,"The characters are void of purpose most of the movie; terrible explanation of why and who are the ""people"" raising against the status quo; fighting scenes that are worst than Chinese B movies (knocking a guy out with a box is not acceptable anymore, or a dozen armed men choosing to wait those extra seconds just enough to fail and then trowing punches at the bat instead of using the guns in the first place), the whole bruce wayne goes to ""hell on earth"" prison that ends up to be a hole with a bunch of old farts where all he does are some sit-ups... come on, it's just plane wrong. But the piece de resistance is when the bat tops the line ""a hero can just be the guy who puts a coat over a children's shoulders and let's him know the world is yadadada..."". I mean, after the dark knight with Ledger, pfffff, this is simply WRONG! Oh, and the end... why make a whole plan to get the bomb to a designated place with all the work involved if all you needed to do was grab a cable and lift it to the sea? I mean, this movie is right there along Charlie's angels and stuff like that. Where's the power punch of the first two? This sucks! Big time!"
tt0137523,"Let's ignore the advice and talk about ""Fight Club"". This film was a milestone; although it bombed at the box office, Fincher's cinematic language left a mark that can still be felt now, 14 years later, on many current releases. Despite the risky 'cutting edge' nature of the film, Fincher got a huge budget for this and it shows: the camera effects and the whole production design are amazing.This movie has a raw energy that grips me every time I watch it. What a crazy, fun ride! Whether it is a very clever satire or pure testosterone going on a rampage - both are fine by me. A film so visually stunning and sexy, with career best performances by all involved - welcome to movie heaven.My vote: 10 out of 10Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
tt0848228,"I really enjoyed the earlier ones but this was really dumbed down.With very little effort they could have made this a great movie.You cannot defy laws of physics in special effects or it becomes completely 5 year old cartoon nonsense. That is the problem here.Be logical with the scenes instead of being lazy. The graphics capability is there so don't cheapen it by taking short cuts.It distracts from the entire movie.That, and great effects mixed in with the most primitive of video overdubbing. In many scenes you can plainly see the backdrop with people standing in front of it. You'd think you were watching a 1940s film with overdubbing ... geeesh.Come on, do it right or don't do it at all."
tt0167261,"Thank You Peter Jackson.  These films are absolutely magical.  The Two Towers has flaws, but is still a great experience of a movie.  I looked at some of those who post to slam this film.  One said that when he buys the movie he would use scene selection to skip over the parts he didn't like.  I suppose the irony was lost on that one.  I also saw a lengthy slam where the poster stated that on the two viewings he had of the film people were laughing at golem.  I love this film, but I have only seen it once.So do you see...  this is a great movie.  Even those who hate it can't look away.  Even though it betrays their personal take on the books, there is magic on the screen that keeps them coming.I will buy the DVD promptly Aug 26th."
tt0993846,"From the very first scenes, the film is embarrassingly crass and vulgar, setting new lows in cinematic tastes, and assaults the ears with a volume of swearwords that would not have been found on the stands of Millwall Fc.It astounds me that Martin Scores and Leonardo Di Carrie would allow themselves to be involved with such trash.The only reason for allotting 2 stars is the quality of colour, audio and scenography.I really looked forward to seeing an updated and improved Wall Street but ended up with 3 hours of torment. Save your time and money and do not encourage Hollywood to make such disgusting nonsense in future."
tt0848228,"First of all, let me just establish the follow IMDb film ratings as a reference:A Clockwork Orange: 8.5 - Aliens (1986): 8.5 - American Beauty: 8.5 - Full Metal Jacket: 8.4 - Chinatown: 8.4 - Fargo: 8.2 - Donnie Darko: 8.1 - A Scanner Darkly: 7These are the kind of movies that get (and should get) 8+ ratings. They have real content. They're innovative, original, intelligent and thought-provoking. They're timeless classics.But the comparison may not be too fair, being such different genres. How does it REALLY stand up to Batman Begins (8.3), Watchmen (7.6), or any of the X-Men series, none of which reached and 8? These are all meant to fascinate and woe the same kind of target: comic-book fans, adrenaline-pumped teenagers and action-yearning males. Yet they are aeons away in terms of originality, depth, story and execution from 2012's The Avengers.I don't really have much of a gripe with ""The Avengers"" itself, as after seeing Captain America, I expected nothing more than another formulaic blockbuster. Even so, it's pretty bad even for a fill-in-the-villain/superhero/threat formula movie. A ridiculous super villain, flat characters, no excitement (as you know how things are going to turn out)My disappointment is mostly with IMDb. I'd trusted their rating in the past, but it seems as if that reliability is no longer. Either all the reviews are now being written by 10-year-olds, IMDb users are losing brain cells at an incredible pace, or something's pretty fishy¬Ö.How many reviews that are titled things like ""Awesome! Blew my mind!"", or ""Coolest superhero movie ever!"", that you'd expect to be full of teenage adulation, grammatical mistakes and tons of slang, are actually very articulately written, displaying profound knowledge of script, direction, acting, and character analysis? I thought our education system was going down the drain! Where are all these lucid, eloquent, youths hiding out? And, being so instructed and discerning as they are, why the hell are they giving such a poorly made, mediocre movie such high scores?It looks like the industry's eye has finally set on IMDb's viewer-decanting power, and is corrupting it's authenticity beyond recognition. From now on, I guess I'll have to look elsewhere for real, trustworthy reviews."
tt0993846,Had to re-watch this. Wild and explicit scenes but overall a well made film.
tt0102926,the film expressed a certain emphasis on the criminal matters now existing in our world. i have read the novel and i though it followed the plot seemingly well. i think anthony hopkins' performance was very sophisticated and i have not yet seen the sequel and i hope his performance was just as good in that.
tt0848228,"It's a film that future generations will still be gushing about, much like previous generations did with such classics as Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It may not be perfect, but The Avengers lives up to its promise and delivers quite a punch. I feel The Avenger struggles as most superhero movies do with finding a way to naturally introduce its characters in a way that doesn't seem forced or formulaic. They do a decent job for what it is, but there are certain times you will feel the campiness of older works coming on as you view the film, and truly you just have to sit through it to get to the action that eventually will be at hand. Besides that though, there isn't many flaws. The acting is rather good, Samuel L. Jackson may take a line too seriously or too, but it's all in good fun. Again Tom Hiddleston as Loki is a major standout, and I also enjoyed the return of Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man and Chris Hemsworth Thor- as well as an improved performance by Chris Evans as Captain America and a great performance from replacement Hulk actor Mark Ruffalo. The action scenes are exciting and tense, there is some camera angles here and there that can be a bit annoying, but for the most part it is rather clear and not awfully tedious action- as many films of this type could be. In the end, despite its campiness and formulaic actions- The Avengers is an incredibly fun time. It takes pride in its stories and characters and makes the most out of an experience that could have easily been phoned in. Its a film that will live on for some time, and one i'm rather glad I got to experience first hand.My Rating: 9.4/10."
tt0133093,"Insomniac computer hacker Keanu Reeves (as Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson ) lives a common and interesting life. Hugo Weaving (as Agent Smith) tells him, ""You've been living two lives. In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company. You have a social security number, pay your taxes, and you help your landlady carry out her garbage.

One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not.""

Mr. Fishburne believes Reeves just may be ""The One"". Mr. Weaving captures Reeves, and tells him Fishburne is the most dangerous man alive. Reeves instinctively distrusts Weaving and, with Ms. Moss' assistance escapes from him.

tt0139414,"""Lake Placid"" is a decent homage to ancient B-cinema. In the good tradition of films like ""Tremors"", we're presented a silly and light-headed tale of an offbeat American region plagued by an exaggeratedly over-sized animal devouring the local rednecks. In this case we have a giant Asian crocodile claiming a Maine-lake as his own and, immediately after eating his first victim (a diver whom he bit in half), a team of weirdo-specialists gathers around the lake to investigate the creature. Everyone slightly familiar with this type of insignificant horror films knows that they're a lot more comical than they are scary, thus ""Like Placid"" is a large buffet of witty dialogues, eccentric characters and over-the-top special effects. The characters are constantly arguing and throwing insults at each other and ¬ñ unlike in many other nowadays creature features ¬ñ it works and this film really qualifies as good, brainless amusement. Especially the interactions between the local, lesser intelligent, Sheriff Brendan Gleeson and the wealthy professional croc-hunter Oliver Platt often make you chuckle. There are a few very grotesque (but ingenious) twists in the second half of the film and I really enjoyed the visual effects (ever seen a crocodile battle a bear?). This is director Steve Minor's first experiment in the monster-movie field, after a whole lot of slashers like Friday the 13th and Halloween sequels, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's looking for 80 minutes of pure amusement."
tt7286456,"In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it."
tt1130884,"I'm usually not very good at predicting twist endings, but even I could see this one coming from a mile away. I mean, when Teddy keeps seeing visions of a dead woman, and we are told there is a missing patient, it doesn't take much to put two and two together.The gist of the film is 2 federal marshals go to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient from a mental asylum. The boss, Teddy, asks a lot of questions, but doesn't get a lot of answers. The story he is told makes it seem impossible for the patient to have vanished from her cell. We soon see things aren't what they seem and there is an even more dangerous patient on the lose.FINAL VERDICT: It's OK, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out what is going on."
tt0120815,"Saving Private Ryan is a top WWII film and I've seen it a dozen times. As the film starts we are presented with a hundred or so ships coming across the sea. Suddenly violence erupts and soldiers are slaughtered on the D-Day Assualt. In the assualt, Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) leads his platoon up and around the German lines for a flank attack.Across the ocean, a mother receives three KIA letters in the same day but is promised that her youngest son, Private Ryan (Matt Damon) will be found in France and sent home. On the Normandy beach, Captain Miller and his platoon will be sent on a suicide mission across France to find Private Ryan and battle across the German lines. Through the whole mission the soldiers are pushed to the limit with the death of comrades and questioning of the mission.Steven Spielberg works his magic again with the presentation of one of the most honored war movies in film history. Tom Hanks is strong, smart and above all good as Captain Miller. There is also a surprise with one of Vin Diesel's first roles as Private Caparzo. The violence is brutal, bloody, and well crafted. Each character is interesting and their fears and weaknesses are each expressed in the film.Saving Private Ryan. Starring: Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edwards Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, and Matt Damon.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars"
tt0172495,"Way overrated - despite great acting (Phoenix is surprising, while Crowe is expectedly excellent) & nice effects with the Roman architecture & look, the over-serious style tries to be Saving Pvt. Ryan meets Julius Caesar & fails at both.  Wooden dialogue, clunky narrative, & boring pace don't help, but worst of all are the Michael Bay-like action scenes - too many edits to make sense!  Ridley Scott continues to show that his only strengths are coming up with nice-looking films, but can't tell much of a story or emotional weight without an exceptional script.  C+"
tt1130884,"Let me say that I went into this movie without having read the book. I was coming in blind, so to speak. Also, I was coming in hopeful. A psychological thriller starring Leo and being directed by Scorsese? Who wouldn't be a little excited? However, my excitement ended shortly after the opening credits.The entire movie was boring, predictable, and I found myself not caring about any of the characters. From the first five minutes, the obvious and supposedly twisted ending is revealed all too easily for the careful watcher. It gives you a feeling that the creators of this film don't think the audience can figure things out for themselves. Everything is handed to us and there's no time for suspense because everything is being answered before you can become curious. There is a great score that's guaranteed to give you goosebumps, but the film doesn't deliver anything but a few jumps here and there.All in all, this film was a horrible miss at a psychological thriller. Both Scorsese and DiCaprio should stick to what they know."
tt0372784,"Anything I say about this film will sell it short. I was originally skeptical when I saw the Urban Assault Vehicle in the trailer, but my fears were calmed when I saw it in context. Everything about this film is perfect - the acting, the directing, the mood, the plot, and all else. It is rare to see such intricate storytelling mixed with bone-shattering intensity in the action department. And fans of the comic will not be disappointed with this apt translation.I hope Chris Nolan directs all future Bat-movies, because his lighting and architectural canvasing was so perfect, it outdid Tim Burton's interpretation (which I previously thought impossible). As of this review, IMDb has rated the movie #117 of all time, and I agree completely. This film has universal appeal. Christian Bale is perfect as Bruce Wayne, Katie Holmes actually acts for once in her career, Liam Neeson is the quintessential villain. Other stars shine brightly. I can only hope that Crispin Glover becomes the Joker in the sequel. Highest possible recommendation..."
tt0068646,"Pretty good, but a bore at times. The plot was very good and has some turns, but overall the story unfolded very slowly. Only the actors did a great job to save the day. I was also very impressed by the music, when you closed your eyes, the music alone can put you in the story."
tt1853728,"Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained is, among much else during its leisurely 165-minute running time, an adolescent male revenge fantasy about an omnipotent mass shooter wreaking carnage upon dozens of victims. I suspect the film would have appealed profoundly to the late Adam Lanza.You might think that this wouldn't be the best time for a quasi-comic daydream/bloodbath about a deadeye gunman who always fires first and is immune to the thousands of bullets shot at him. But the recent unpleasantness in Sandy Hook has gone almost unmentioned in the critical hosannas greeting Django¬Öbecause, you see, the invulnerable hero is a black gunman shooting bad (i.e., Southern white) people.It's not much more complicated than that.For example, in the The New York Times, the scholarly and mild-mannered A. O. Scott declares Django:""a troubling and important movie about slavery and racism.""According to Tarantino lore, the former video-store clerk is a dyslexic with a 160 IQ. It's hard not to be amused by how easily this semi-literate junior high school-dropout dupes 21st-century intellectuals.The reason Tarantino has had the time to watch so many bad movies is because he doesn't like the written word. Most people of Tarantino's intelligence discover that reading is a higher bandwidth way of finding out about the world than watching straight-to-video dreck. But the auteur's learning disability has left him defensively proud that he's ill informed about everything other than movies.Slavery is a potentially fascinating topic, but to have something interesting to say about it would require Tarantino to read a book. And that was never going to happen. After all, white men were the only men to abolish slavery but who cares about that little tidbit of truth?Tarantino may not know how to spell, but he knows how you are supposed to think: solely in terms of Who? Whom? The only thing that matters anymore is whose side you are on.Just as Tarantino is being praised today for empowering blacks by having them slaughter whites, he was praised for empowering Jews by having them slaughter Nazis in Inglourious Basterds and empowering women by having them slaughter men in Kill Bill.As you may have noticed, Tarantino isn't black, Jewish, or female. Nor has he shown much genuine interest in those designated victim groups. Instead, Tarantino's favorites have always been middle-aged movie tough guys.A cynic might suggest that what Tarantino really likes is the slaughtering. He's happy to make the details of who slaughters whom conform to the current prejudices, just as long as he gets to keep up the gore level. All Tarantino has had to do to critic-proof himself is identify the zeitgeist's sacred cows (so far, women, Jews, and blacks, but not gays) and have them massacre their foes. (Someday we may be treated to a Tarantino ABC Afterschool Special about the plague of bullying in which a CGI version of Charles Bronson show up at school to take out the homophobic trash.) The premise of Tarantino's latest film is that ""young Django,"" a slave played by 45-year-old Jamie Foxx, teams up with the loquacious Christoph Waltz, 56 (once again dripping with Gem√ºtlichkeit before he suddenly guns everybody down) to kick white butt. In 2009's Inglourious Basterds, Waltz played a Nazi bad guy, while in Django he's a Viennese anti-slavery good guy, but he's always the same character, Tarantino's talkative alter ego.Indeed, Basterds' Jewish revenge plot was essentially a front to allow Tarantino to indulge his fascination with National Socialist (Nazi) cinema. What would it have been like, Quentin wondered, if he had been Goebbels to Harvey Weinstein's Hitler? In Django, a similarly vast amount of the dialogue is turned over to Waltz. Unfortunately, Tarantino's Teutonophilia can't get much traction in Django. He has a vague notion that in 1858 Richard Wagner was contemplating The Ring cycle‚Äîthus Django's wife is named Broomhilda‚Äîbut has no idea what Waltz ought to do with that. (The excessively articulate Waltz would be better suited to playing Wagner,but the composer never killed anybody and lived before the invention of movies, so don't look to Quentin for biopic ideas.) All these distractions leave poor Foxx with little to do except shoot white people.In 2013, is the black gun violence Tarantino espouses really such a fascinating new phenomenon? For generations now, American media have been encouraging blacks to take violent retribution. We're coming up on close to a half-century of whites in the media egging on black badassery.How's Tarantino's macho minstrel show working out for black males, anyway? According to a 1967 government report sponsored by the Surgeon General, the black homicide rate began to rise in 1962 after a long decline. Mostly, though, whites just move out of the way and blacks kill each other. The federal Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that for the 30 years from 1976-2005, there were 276,000 African-American homicide victims, 94% of them murdered by other blacks. They also hold the title in interracial rape with an average of 37,000 black on white assaults per year while the white on black is listed as ""less than 10,"" which we all know means zero.But who cares about a quarter of a million murdered black people and interracial rape? What matters is white-on-white moral status striving. And in that eternal war, even Quentin Tarantino is a welcome recruit. Enjoy."

tt0120737,"J. R. R Tolkein's books are wonderful, with memorable characters, an enchanting atmosphere, strong narrative and dialogue and an epic story. Peter Jackson's trilogy mayn't be necessarily true to them, but it does have the memorable characters, the epic story and enchanting atmosphere that the books do. The Fellowship of the Ring is probably the weakest of the three, but it is a very solid start. It is I agree slower in pace to the other two, and there are some talky scenes that drag it down a tad."
tt0993846,"I didn't like Wolf of Wall Street for a number of reasons. It was very repetitive and ultimately boring. How many times can one watch people snort coke, get drooly on Quaaludes, and have sex with prostitutes? How many smooth-skinned blondes with shaved privates are enough, and how many times do we have to watch mindless machismo and bonding? After the third or fourth scene of juvenile debauchery the excesses of the central characters become mind-numbingly dull. I recognized many attempts to inject a little of the magic of Goodfellas into the proceedings, which made me wish I was watching it instead of Wolf of Wall Street. Don't get me started on the film's attitude towards women (even aside from the aforementioned prostitutes.)The movie had a bit of humor, especially towards the end, but the characters were not developed and many chances to deepen the movie were missed. The movie came alive only in a few scenes, usually ones accompanied by music. It made me sad to see a director I admire making such a hash of it, and reputable actors trying valiantly to turn two dimensions into three."
tt0372784,"This movie lot of fun. You should definitely see it if you don't mind canon changes (again, after all, this is DC we're talking about), and/or if you like Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman or Morgan Freeman. All fabulous in this.--spoilers past this point-- I love Gary Oldman. He made this movie worth watching for me. Every time he was on screen, I squeed. And you could tell he was having fun, too. Particularly when he got to use the Batmobile. ;D And they showed his family! I wanna see Babs! (But I'm more than willing to wait.) Things that worked: the training sequences, particularly the final training fight between Christian and Liam, which was excellently choreographed. The idea that Wayne Enterprises was being run by a board, because his father was a doctor in canon, so it was a nice nod to why there was a corporation. Where the bat-toys came from! OMG, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. And he was excellent. ""Mister Wayne...Don't think of me as an idiot."" :D The slow development of Bruce Wayne, depressed and guilty millionaire's son to Batman was just about perfect. Also, Ra's Al Ghul's part in the story was perfect. I had my doubts when I saw that the person playing him wasn't well-known, but trust me...he's PERFECT. Also, I loved that they used Crane/Scarecrow in this very first story. And that for once, the did multiple villains *right*. It ends up setting up everything to come. The final scene with Gordon and Batman on the rooftop (another great line... ""I couldn't find a mob boss""), and his clue for this Arkham criminal Batman's going to have to capture (no, I won't say which. It's obvious when you see the clue, but it's a biggie.) were excellent. Gives me hope for good movies in the future.The bad: I felt rather beat over the head with the ""Fear"" mallet, specifically at the beginning. And they didn't follow through on it nearly enough. They were obviously having too much fun with the car-chases, blowing things up, and other action scenes. Oh, and I don't hate Katie Holmes, but does she have any other acting style? I swear she was just being Joey from Dawson's Creek. Not what I wanted to see. I would much have preferred to see Talia (Ra's daughter) as a love interest. Seeing as how she really didn't do much for the plot, and their ""romance"" was nonexistent. Michael Cane was nice, but felt mostly unused. I would have liked something more for him to do than snark sweetly at still-evolving Bruce.What I would like from the next one? More thought, less action, more plot. One villain (Joker or Two-face would be nice, but not necessary). And a true love interest...who doesn't find out/figure out who Batman is, or even get taken to his cave, k?"
tt0816692,"I am wondering if the people who write ""intertstellar"" 10-star reviews are actually sane, or if they base their opinion on a movie library completely deprived of everything that is sci-fi. Basically if the sic-fi component - most of which does not really happen until the end - is removed from the plot the movie by and large is a classic Hollywood soap opera. The worn-out rag of clich√© family relations, all- American-dad, ""complicated"" love affair, unruly and a classic tomboy-girl, co-workers (more like co-idiots) who rebel and despite all common sense act irrationally, you know, to ""up the ante""... it really makes up 90% of this movie. Up until half- way trough I honestly considered walking away from this boring tragedy which is the lack of creative talent on the part of the script writers and director. There are also very obvious holes in the plot, and not just irregularities but direct contradictions that even the most obnoxious sic-fi movies at least try to amend somehow.I can not help but think that after watching Automata which was a breath of fresh air in many regards, this movie is like walking into a small toilet where someone just took a huge dump. It is literally that bad. What saves this movie by the skin of its teeth is the ending. So just watch that instead, because until then you could have just as well been watching an episode of Santa Barbara.Spolers about ridiculous plot holes (as if the soap part of the movie is not stressed enough): 1) The stupid Dust Bowl recycled. Seriously? I am not even going to try to explain this because I'd need to re-post have of Wikipedia here, but it does not work that way. Not in the past - not in the future. 2) The moment NASA abducts the main character and daughter and questions them. Seriously? Maybe they should also have shot them on sight? 3) NASA's facility is top secret! Right... in the age supposedly after the present, when there are drones and google maps, they manage to hide a huge facility in some old James Bond villain fashion. 4) ""LET'S GO TO ANOTHER GALAXY!"". OK if the movie shows a fairly conventional rocket, carrying a futuristic ""shuttle"", WHY for the love of all holy would anyone risk going there - instead of looking in our own? What, they really expected to have better luck there - than in our own? They already searched the entire Milky Way? And what's even better - it ""just so happens"" there is a planet like a stone's throw away from the black hole and is NOT being consumed by it, and somehow a black hole which is now proved to be a collapsed star is anything BUT a collapsed star? Why... let's just start diving down toilets, because you know, they are not full of s*** but are actual doorways to different dimensions! Like dimensions of dementia perhaps! 5) Saving the best for last - I did like the ending. Despite its absurdity I did like it. Almost cried - if I were a 14 year old girl with especially fragile psychology, but I digress. The ""machine"" that allows the main character to conviniently contact his daughter in the future- past, is built by... the very humanity he is trying to save, that survived, and built the machine in the future. Lord have mercy, I will try to explain this... So basically if we consider all major theories about time travel, in order to change the future one must go there and change it, right? But here the future changes the past, and that past is what changed the future with the help of the future that is changed in the past with the changed future's help. Mind >>> blown!"
tt1375666,"Went to see it today and came out of the cinema very disappointed, borderline angry... I have to admit though that my expectations were too big for what is after all just another summer blockbuster. First the story, you'd call it original if someone like Philip K Dick had never existed. Thing is, he really existed (we could question that after all, that would probably please both Dick and Nolan... Sigh)and he wrote dozens of books on the subject, which makes this movie anything but original storytelling wise. Also the movie is far too long, they should have cut off at least 30-45 minutes, almost fell asleep at the 1h30 point. The scenario is not even well thought, sometimes even incoherent and the director tries to hide its weaknesses with lots SFX and gunshots. I'm especially thinking about the last ""jump"" to go to the limbos, it's not the 4th level as there's no 4th level in the architect plans, the limbos, as previously told during the movie, is the place you end up in when you die in the dream and can't wake up in real life, so why is it suddenly possible for them to get there without dying ? (and don't serve me the ""they go in Cobb's mind"" crap, i don't buy it) Good points in the movie : SFX (i loved Paris folding on itself) Cast (thank god there were good actors in that movie...)All in all not such a bad movie, but certainly not a masterpiece of sheer originality. 5/10 would be my note if it wasn't so over-hyped, I chose to give 3/10 to strike back on the sheep giving it a ten when it certainly does not deserve it AT ALL."
tt0816692,"Interstellar, while visually stunning, is one of the most flawed films in recent memory. Flawed, because more time was spent rendering out the special effects than developing a screenplay worthy of the cast and budget. When you're a filmmaker who can make anything you want - on film - there is no excuse for your films to at-least bring something new to the table and work at a basic screenplay level.Interstellar does not ask new questions and with a script that literally feels like a first draft --I'm just shocked that Nolan didn't develop this more. The entire core of this film is the relationship between our lead Cooper and his daughter - but this is so rushed and honestly, extremely cheesy, that we don't care what happens. They spend far too much in time in space - with a ridiculous plot involving Matt Damon - and cut back to Earth is sporadic cuts that pull us into so many directions.This film proves that the Nolan brothers can not handle a couple of things: writing females and writing emotional characters that we're attached to. The dialogue was laughable - over the top in many places - and basically just a ton of one-liners. We cut from Cooper learning he has to go to space - says goodbye - boom on the rocket - NO ATTACHMENT. There is zero development here - just get him to space, which fails to tell the core story well - which bites this movie in its ass in the third act.Forced. Rushed. However you want to put it - I'm sorry folks - it's not a great movie - not even a good one. Everything is spoon fed to the audience - no, not just the science - the twists - I didn't know on the nose screen writing was so acceptable in Hollywood - guess it is. They talk about ghosts so many times within the first act that anyone with half a brain KNEW there was something there - and if you know anything about space travel, black holes - or any of the stuff that is talked about in the trailers - can put two and two together and call the major twist in the FIRST ACT.Come on Nolan, you can do better."
tt0172495,"Gladiator! A thrilling tale of a Roman general who must battle against all thinkable odds to avenge the death of his family and restore justice to the empire. The plot is simple, legendary general Maximus Decimus Meridius, after many victorious campaigns and battles wants to return to his peaceful home in Spain, However the kind, fair and dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius wishes to bestow his title on him over his cruel son, Commodus. Commodus is understandably annoyed and kills his father calming the title of Emperor. Maximus is sentenced to death along with the rest of his family back at his home in Spain. Maximus escapes but is unable to save his wife and son. His loss of will to live makes him an east target for slavers and he is soon sold as a gladiator. He fights his way into the coliseum in Rome were he wins over the crowd and uses his celebrity status to defy the Emperor, to whom he swears his vengeance for the death of his family, after many battles and political backstabbing he gets his chance to fight the Emperor in the Arena.This is just such an amazing film, it captures every emotion possible in only the way an expert director can achieve, we can go on for whole scenes without the need for speaking, everything is told through the genuine body language and expressions. And when there is conversing we get such emotion and wonderfully powerful quotes ¬ñ ""What we do in life, echoes in eternity"" Wow.The opening scene is spellbinding, showing the true gore of battle, the fight scenes are marvellously realistic, discarding the popular ""pretty"" sword fighting for brutal aggressive force. The audience in the arena express every emotion, surprise, anger, and enjoyment. The cast is brilliantly chosen; we can really see Russell Crowe as a gladiator, in Commodus, Joaquin Phoenix gives us a man we can really hate, Connie Nielson shows real emotion and passion in the role of Lucilla. So apart from the spellbinding acting, scarily realistic fight scenes and the amazing script, what else can we look for? The music is just stunning, its exactly what we need brought in at exactly the right time, truly wonderful directing. And then we have the stunning special effects, we can really visualise the greatness that is Rome, the fight scenes really make you believe. Some critics have condemned the lack of historical fact, for instance an emperor would never fight a gladiator, and these comments cannot be denied, its true.But I think we can forgive them that one fault for such an amazing movie. Without hesitation I give this movie a truly deserved 10/10!"
tt0167261,"After the wonderful realization of ""The Fellowship of The Ring,"" I was greatly anticipating the next installment with ""The Two Towers."" As a writer I can understand that some changes need to be made to adapt a book to a film; however, I think the title given to this movie should have been ""Peter Jackson's Two Towers."" The plot changes and additional scenes with Arwen were absolutely unnecessary for translating the book to film. These changes simply represented how the director wanted the books to go and the heck with Tolkein.There was much to like about the movie in terms of art direction and special effects. Unfortunately, so much attention went to creating digital characters (and I'll say that Gollum was nicely done in large part to Andy Serkis' work) that the real actors were left to stand around and watch, or react to what the virtual characters were doing, which was the downfall of ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace."" Thankfully Gollum was no Jar Jar Binks, but it still created a similar issue. The relationships between the characters in ""Fellowship of the Ring"" were beautiful and moving, and now all of a sudden everyone's emotionally disconnected with each other - except for Arwen and Strider, and Arwen never once set foot in the ""Two Towers"" book! Ugh.I'm no purist where Tolkein is concerned and I would have been able to live with small changes necessary to make a movie. For example, I can understand why the film didn't end at the same place that the book did and that didn't bother me too much. Nevertheless, there were some very rich scenes in Tolkein's novel (from the growing friendship between Legolas and Gimli, to some very moving moments between Frodo and Sam, one of which awakens the best out of Gollum for a moment) that were ignored and replaced by Mr. Jackson's own ideas. This I cannot live with and makes me very angry.  I hope he gets back to Tolkein's world when he finishes the last movie because I don't like Jackson's."
tt0848228,"i like some avengers comics (especially the first ultimates series) and thought the second iron man movie was pretty good, but the avengers is a mess of exposition, cluttered action and pandering references.some problems...1. loki is the villain. terrible idea to have this team essentially fighting 1 medieval hero for most of the movie. and makes them seem weak, too. 2. stupid proclamations about ""we're at war"" seems silly throughout (until the end) when really...they're just fighting loki. 3. good guys with mind control turned into bad guys is always very bad in movies. 4. roughly 30+ minutes of bad speeches by & conversations with loki, each like the dumbest bad guy explaining himself scenes from james bond movie. 5 scarlett johanson is as bad as she is cute. totally unbelievable at all times. 6. lots of self-conscious dialog that would play okay in a comic book, not great here. 7. samuel jackson should be a newscaster 8. the good build to the hulk transformation was then injured by a weightless, bad cg hulk no better than the ed norton version. like all thoughtless directors who don't understand physics, wheedon has the huge character move like hummingbird or a gnat and thus it feels like a weightless video game. as bad as the cave trolls in fellowship of the ring or worse. 9. the only clever idea--- stark starting the propeller with his suit--- just ""happens"" rather than having a sequence building up to it of the ship going down and him getting in there and helping. like all action scenes in the movie (except the long take) it is unfocused and ""shows"" rather than ""builds."" 10. if it weren't for the character development outside this movie, the iconography of these characters and the charisma of iron man & thor, this wouldn't even be a 5."
tt1130884,"The trailer had me wondering if the movie would miss its mark. I was expecting the haunting atmosphere with a mystery to boot. I kinda wondered if there were going to be ghosts or evil creatures. But I left that in the back of my mind. I opted more for the mystery and atmosphere.Unfortunately, I expect DiCaprio to disappoint me because he just doesn't have that ""quality actor"" appeal for me. I am also aware I am probably not in the majority. But as it goes, I am slowly coming out of my cloud of negativity. This was one of DiCaprio's better roles. I liked him best in The Departed but Shutter Island is going to stick in my mind for a long time.Ben Kingsley was at the top of his game here as the mysterious Dr. Cawley. He was an easy man to be suspicious of thanks to his squinty eyes and devious smirks. Thanks also to the implications and direction of the movie. While DiCaprio and Kingsley easily filled the bill for leads, all the actors did a great job of keeping this viewer's attention.The atmosphere and scenery provided satisfactory background while the action and actors merged well to make this such a great, void-less movie. Yes, the sea was angry that day my friend, but actions, icons, trinkets and memories kept the restless mind rolling. Push came to shove when doubt tried to overrule belief. ""Up"" and ""down"" had no meaning or relevance when it came time to analyze. What did have meaning was the love for the mystery and love itself.Once again, Scorsese puts it altogether in such a beautiful way. You sir, are the boss! And I mean that in a good way. Thanks! 9 of 10"
tt0167260,"Is what I kept asking myself when watching this movie, it could have easily been 30 minutes shorter.Loved the first one, but didn't really care for the second two.In Part 3, we have many of the same scenarios repeated from earlier in the film or in the other films; good guys defending their city, outnumbered by the Orcs; looks like they're about to die, but then another group of good guys come to save them, yaay!How many times will we see Frodo having doubts or being tempted by the ring, and Sam comes to the rescue? How many times will we see someone dying and their friend there to comfort them? How many times will we see the same close up shot of Frodo with that same look on his face? Was there a point to Liv Tyler being in any of the movies? Her character did nothing. Sauron and his role was barely mentioned in this movie, therefor his defeat (the big eye falling over; lame) was very unsatisfying.This is another example of a big budget, over-hyped movie being filled with amazing graphics (and they are amazing) but little depth to the storyline. I felt no emotion while watching this movie, it did nothing to draw me in."
tt0361748,"This Tarantino film is great but doesn't go without its flaws, the characters are amazing with classic Tarantino cinematography and writing. In terms of the score of the film (being a Tarantino film) it was amazing and really set the mood for the film/scenes. The flaws now, I think the script can sometimes be very stilted and some scenes tend to drag on a little longer than I think needed to. Not one of Tarantino's strongest movies, but nonetheless is still an awesome watch."
tt1375666,"Style over Substance might be a Knee-Jerk Negative Reaction to this Messy Film. But that would be Kind. There is no Style or Substance to Waste many Brain-Cells Considering. The Movie's Conceit is to make You want to Think. Think Not.It tries so Very Hard with its Explanations about Dreams (don't do a drinking game taking a shot every time the word dream is mentioned, you will be dead by intermission). Also Wordy, Incomprehensible Insertions about the Teams ""Method"" used here to Infiltrate and Control the Minds of Corporate Clients (now there is a group we can morally support).This is so Unnecessarily Complicated that it causes Viewer Fatigue, and by Proximation Sleepiness, early on and Waking Up or Recovering from that is not a Given. The Result is just not Caring about Anyone or Anything that is happening on the Screen. What is happening is kind of Drab and Dull for a Dreamscape.If you buy the Premise and go along for the Ride, better fasten your Seat-Belts because it is anything but Smooth. It Bumps and Jumps from Dream to Dream and Layer upon Layer of Intellectual Gobbledygook that is so Very Uninteresting and Without much Pathos. The Music is forever in Swelling Mode and Ripples throughout and is Pretentious and Intrusive.In the End, some have trouble making it that far, there is a ""you decide"" Twist that is not really a Twist because, after all, You Decide. But it is hardly Worth it and when all is Said and Done, too much has been Said and not enough has been Done. Vastly Overrated."
tt1375666,"Not intellectual, and done before. Just boring. I'd rather just sit there and stare at a blank screen. Like all the 21st century movies, we need more imaginative movies. Original movies. Something that hasn't been done before."
tt1853728,"Great direction, screenplay, performances, soundtrack, cinematography, costume design, production design, all the things you can expect from a Tarantino film.Also like others Tarantino films, only those who really have a extensive knowledge of films are going to really appreciate some things, like the Franco Nero scene."
tt0816692,"It is incomprehensible to me that I watched the same movie that the majority of reviewers of this movie on IMDb seemed to. Perhaps I was unknowingly sucked into a blackhole, wormhole, or plot hole that most of the other reviewers of this movie managed to avoid. All I know is that my hard-earned money was sucked into this monstrosity along with me and for that I am truly regretful. Like a few other commenters, I had absolutely no feelings or connection with any of the characters, even hoping at times that they would all fail in their meaningless endeavors. A ridiculous premise with outlandish and unscientific bases, very little of this movie makes any sense at all. It amazes me that Nolan was able to draw the acting talent to this waste of time, as their considerable skills are completely wasted on this drivel.I should note that on several occasions, I actually couldn't help but laugh out loud at the absurdity, and that fact was truly telling for me.Mr. Nolan, et al - you owe me two hours and forty-nine minutes of my life back!"
tt0120815,By far the most captivating war time movie to date. With a great cast that really help put into perspective the effect war has on everyone and the amount of losses that could happen at any moment. It shows Spielberg at his prime and all the effort everyone put into the movie to make it as realistic and atmospheric as it is.
tt0167260,"Considering the hype, box office numbers, Oscars and everything else, the Lord of the Rings trilogy has been for a lot of people the highlight of film making these last couple of years. And even without very much liking it, as a person who did not read the books and though I feel that everybody was just overdoing it, I must congratulate Peter Jackson and his team of cast and crew by accomplishing just that. Maybe, when things cool down a bit and other projects take their place in the spotlights, I can honestly get over the fact that all those people who think this is how movies should be, clearly outnumber the people like myself who see it as a good, but ultimately failed attempt on producing a wonderful trilogy from a no doubt inspiring book.Peter Jackson did not have an easy job by filming the trilogy, and I will give you an example on how to work with a silly part of the trilogy (I at least assume that the next passage is in the book somewhere as well). It's when Frodo is attacked by the huge spider, and taken to a castle of the orks (or similar nasty creatures).In the next scene, we see how 2 orks get into a fight over I think a piece of clothing. Everybody (that is, the other orks) have their say in it and a huge brawl starts. So when Sam comes to the castle to save his master Frodo, he finds thousands of Orks dead on the ground, only having to kill about 4 of them before getting to the top of the tower, where Frodo is held.Now, in any other movie that takes itself remotely serious, these events would be laughable, ridiculous, the movie would be slammed for it. But here comes the nice part: because it is 'in the book', Jackson gets away with these silly little facts. As he got away with the fact that the whole and entire army of Sauron go on and take on the army, not one noticing the two little hobbits and the creature called Gollem. And there are other examples, like the death and rise (apparently) from Gandalf in part 2, the oh-so easy defeat of Saruman when some silly looking trees come to action... the plot holes are endless.I will be clear: because of above reasons (amongst others), I do not think highly of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It started out with the rather boring Fellowship, went on with the loud but ultimately silly Two Towers, and ended with the incredibly disappointing and not satisfying Return of the King, the least of the three. It's too long, with lulls everywhere and a complete lack of decent acting because of the overuse of CGI. It's boring, silly and not to be taken seriously. It's, in one word, a drag, in particular for people who did not read the books, or didn't take much fun into them.So, in the end, there's a trilogy here that has ruled the box office and that special night somewhere in february nowadays, but I am not convinced one bit. And somehow I don't think I will be any time in the future...As for Return of the King: 4/10."
tt0372784,"I don't like to comment on giant blockbusters because their humongous fan base usually doesn't appreciate criticism of any kind. Oh well, my rant here contains more 'remarks' than actual criticism, so I'm going to spill my guts anyway. Although a very good film (and definitely a vast improvement over those dreadful Joel Schumacher films¬Ö) there's something essential missing in Christopher Nolan's reprising of the Batman-franchise: comic-book darkness! Whether intended or not, ""Batman Begins"" doesn't seem to take place in an imaginary world where good battles evil but in a real-life drama setting where every individual has to fight for survival¬Ö Basically not a bad idea at all, but it's not exactly the ideal setting to have a man flying around, wearing a bat-suit. Bruce Wayne ought to be a superhero but instead he's an emotionally and physically vulnerable man with phobias and no sense of morbid humor. Also, the gimmicks and designs are a lot less exhilarating than they should be. For example: the Bat-mobile here is nothing but a car-tuned Hum-V and Gotham City looks an awful lot like an (even more) pauperized version of New York. Yes, the script is very solid and the cast is terrific¬Öbut by no means this ""new"" Batman can live up to the unequaled and blackly ingenious Tim Burton movies that launched the hype about 15 years ago. The film's opening (featuring a young Bruce Wayne on a meditation tour in Tibet) is long and complex but very interesting and a rewarding intro to the new Batman myth. When the story is then transferred to Gotham city, the movie becomes more action-packed and the class-A cast receives the opportunity to show off their talents. I particularly liked Gary Oldman in the (for him) awkward role of honest cop, Tom Wilkinson as the mighty underworld gangster and Rutger Hauer as the greedy and corrupt business manager. I personally found Michael Caine to be unfunny and sophomoric in his role of Alfred the butler and it was sad to see the role of Scarecrow played by a bizarre young nerd."
tt0816692,"This is weird... I love Science Fiction and I love astrophysics, but disliked everything about this movie. The start was extremely slow and it was hard to stay awake. The second half of the movie was somewhat better but felt like a very cheap rip-off of Space 2001. The movie just didn't do it for me at all and the acting was average. I'm totally flabbergasted that the average rating stands at 9 out of 10. Maybe audiences have lost the notion of quality, story-line, plot, acting, and uniqueness - as this movie doesn't have any of it. Ah well, I guess I'll just have to wait for the next SF movie and hope it will be somewhat better, because I am deeply disappointed by Interstellar as I expected so much more from a movie with an estimated budget of $165 million."
tt0816692,"Interstellar is a movie that never gets off the ground. Based on a script that wanders from end to end attempts to comprehend its plot and themes are very difficult for the viewer. Heavily weighted with Academy Award winners including Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine and Ellen Burstyn they are never able to surmount this poorly written script. From the beginning it was obvious many elements of Interstellar were lifted from other films. These included 2001 a Space Odyssey and Enemy Mine. Promising not to giveaway details Muppets in Space was more enjoyable. Interstellar starts in a backwater town and ends on a planet 2nd rate planet. With a running time of 2 hours and 49 minutes schedule yourself at least one break. Why? Because you will be staring at your watch constantly hoping the film would tear. I rated his movie 5 out of 10 which I believe was generous. Mark Davis MD"
tt1853728,"By incorporating a multitude of thematic Tarantino elements Django is the best Tarantino movie SINCE Pulp Fiction. Not as good as that great movie since this one is a little more bloated and less novel, it nonetheless is Tarantino's second best movie. This was great because it used many of the best aspects of the other Tarantino films. Such as the friendship between a black and white antihero (a hit-man like in Pulp Fiction but now the male bonding is as bounty hunters), also the violence art similar to Kill Bill and the Gut Warming, heart pounding, pulpy thrill of revenge against an evil like in Inglorious Bastards. There were many other aspects of Tarantino's movie in this one.To start off the complete unpredictability is what really draws you in. You really do not know what is going to happen next which is refreshing to those that frequently see movies. The episodic scenes have such a high degree of unpredictability that it mesmerizingly keeps us on the edge of our seats.There were some really amazing characters created which was not wholly due to the writer/director but the great actors who infused their talent into the roles. These characters' eccentricities were so unique that you might have never seen characters like this before. A trademark oddity in how they spoke, what they said and their ultimate actions reflected without any creative barriers the moviemaker's soul. If you thought Christopher Waltzes and Jamie Foxx's character were great wait till you get to DiCaprios and Samuel L Jacksons. You really wanted to see more of these characters despite the nearly 3 hour length of this Tarantino epic. Dicaprio's character was probably the best; he was so amusing with his warped, semi-depraved, megalomaniac eccentricity. DiCaprios acting was really good here too. Samuel L Jackson can blurt out the necessary profanities with the appropriate rawness making him the perfect actor for some of Tarantino's parts.The greatest thing is the psychological aspects to these characters and how that plays out in the scenes. There is actually a lot of psychology going on which builds multi-dimensional characters and creates scenes of intense unpredictability. There were other scenes of brilliant hilarity mocking the dark side of the old south, or genre film itself.As the movie progressed and where it could have ended well and uniquely alas a contrived scene was thrown in to showcase Tarantino's signature brand of violence art, reminiscent of Kill Bill. This weakened the movie as a whole and made it drag however it was pure fun to witness the slow motion blood splattering and detailed depiction of body parts being shot with blood shooting out like geysers drenching the place in red.I think I heard Tarantino is criticized for rehashing old movies or copying from other films. I guarantee whether or not that is the case you've never seen something like this before."
tt0816692,"I know nothing about astrophysics or cosmology and I watched this film 10 years ago- I was 14. Throughout the years, I've lost count on how many times I have rewatched this movie.This film tackles about such a complex matter which involves knowledge about different branches of science. As a former 14-year-old sci-fi fanatic, this movie was laid out in such a way that people will understand. While science might not be everybody's thing, this film touches the subject of family and survival; something everyone can relate to.It's a great tear-jerking film that makes people question what they know about the universe and all the possibilities it offers. At some point of the film, it will also make you question your morals and empathize with the characters.Interstellar is a thought-provoking piece that I think is a must-watch for everyone, especially Sci-fi lovers."
tt0313792,"This movie really is an underrated gem. Somehow most critics have become totally unable to accept Woody Allen's work for what it is and compare it only to other movies from the same years.Woody Allen has said many times that he has no interest in looking back to his old work and, in my opinion, it really shows. From someone who has often raved about the 'Radio Days' of his youth and adores prewar Jazz, he has steadily developed into a director who has no trouble catching the modern every day lives of the people around him. Recreating the atmosphere from his older movies would only show the inability to move on, along with the rest of the world.Anything Else is proof of that. It's a modern movie with a typical Woody Allen style dialogue that works on several levels. Between the jokes and witty remarks and often great replies, lie the worries of any young guy or girl that has to learn to deal with life's fears and frustrations. Anything Else also has a really nice atmosphere and a great pace - the movie at almost 2 hours never feels like it's stalling or going nowhere. The story moves forward constantly. Biggs really is the star here and is a perfect Young Woody Allen. Ricci is only a supporting character, but both she and the rest of the cast really make this into a believable, relaxed and enjoyable experience.For those who are willing to learn a little: this movie does make a simple, but very true point about learning to deal with life.Photography, directing, editing and writing is really first class work - nothing less than what you get in other top Woody Allen movies. Beautiful locations, great camera work and typical Woody style jazz really make this into a perfect 10/10.The lack of awards and negative reviews are just like Dobel (Woody Allen) says in this movie: You know....it's just like anything else.Go see it for yourselves!"
tt0114369,"Rarely does a thriller murder film draw in the audience from start to end without presenting predictable foreshadowing. From the opening credits leaving out Kevin Spacey's name to the consistent ""one step behind the killer"" storyline, Se7en accomplishes a dramatic theme of leaving the audience in a dynamic na√Øve state through the eyes of Mills and Somerset. Although the acting was emotionally and physically precise, it was the cinematography and lighting that generated the dreary setting and interactions throughout the film, often evoking the appropriately timed tension and emotion. Presented beyond the surface, however, Se7en calls upon a society accusation through the thread of Dante's ""Seven Deadly Sins."" Se7en indirectly advocates that society, as a whole, is migrating towards an inevitable abyss filled with specialization in many of these deadly sins. Even though humans may be ignorant to this path, it continues to occur all around us until we become dragged into it, just like Mills in the ending. The only individual within Se7en that posed a dichotomous relation was Somerset; as he continued to logically view the world in awe of the irrevocability. Somerset and Doe both saw the world in this 3rd person perspective, but their actions represented their individual commitment to the change of society. Doe was willing to take action in an upsetting demonstration, but Somerset continually wanted to escape the world in a hopeless fashion. Therefore, Se7en displays multiple protagonists and antagonists throughout the movie. On the surface, Mills and Somerset are the protagonists trying to stop the killer, John Doe, who is the antagonist. Indirectly being argued, however, is that Doe and Somerset are the protagonists with opposing plans towards the change in societal nature (being represented as the antagonist through the seven deadly sins characters including Mills). That is why I give Se7en a 10/10 for its ability to draw in the audience through cinematography, lighting, plot, and controversial character dynamic throughout the entire film."
tt0133093,What if I told you the Matrix is not a Sci-Fi but a Documentary movie?
tt0397103,"I love this film!!! This is a beautiful story, well-written - a film worth watching! From the moment it began I was drawn in to the beautiful photography and story set in China. All of the storyline that was filmed there was pertinent, realistic and touching. The message of the film is sacrifice, love, and compassion. Luoyong Wang, Yi Ding, and Mika Boorem were all fantastic. Both Erik von Detten and Sean Astin's acting was natural and believable.The majority of the film set in Malibu in an attempt at character building, is substandard. Part of this has to do, I believe, with the editing. For example Linda Hamilton's character appears loving and caring one minute, then manic depressive and ""out of control"" the next and them back to a loving caring mother/wife the next with no apparent reason for the extreme transitions. We don't need to see ""Katie"" dressing immodestly, see her parents freaking out on each other, or see her internal conflict about having sex with her boyfriend, or the way she uses sex to manipulate and frustrate two teenage boys to know she is not a touchy-feely, caring ""good girl."" It could have been shown simply with the way she is derogatory about her classmates and unbelieving that people in the world could be less physically beautiful than she. Sorry, this part was over-done. I would love to see a re-make of this some day...in the meantime, see this one and enjoy the beauty of the film spiritually and physically!"
tt0361748,"Even though the title is virtually identical to Enzo G. Castellari's 1978 Italian warsploitation 'classic' The Inglourious Bastards, Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is most definitely NOT a remake. Far from it. Not only is it one of Tarantino's more original efforts to date, but it also one of his best films for a long time, a riveting tale of derring-do that features plenty of everything that made his first two movies such a success: great dialogue, wonderful performances (Christoph Waltz is brilliant, as is an almost unrecognisable Mike Myers), excellent pacing, impressive direction, explosive violence, fantastic use of music, and more than a few playful visual touches of the kind that only Quentin seems to be able to get away with.Despite being fairly talky in places, with the bulk of the dialogue spoken in either German or French (and subtitled in English), the film is a thoroughly absorbing experience, with not a boring moment in its entire 153 minutes. The long conversational scenes are brilliantly executed and entertaining in their own right, but they also serve to make the violence seem even more explosive and brutal when it happens. And boy, is it nasty when it wants to be, with bloody scalpings, repeated baseball bat blows to the skull, and point-blank gunshots to the nether regions amongst the graphic carnage on display.It's not all typically cool Tarantino monologues and OTT gore, though: in an extremely bold move, the writer/director eventually steers events into fantastical territory, rewriting history to suit his whims. Those who have slated the film for its lack of historical accuracy are completely missing the point: Quentin is giving us his version of events, entertainment being the number one priority, facts be damned. It's daring movie-making and a whole lot of fun when approached with the right attitude."
tt0068646,"It's a tale of contempt and corruption, extortion and fraud and disruption, the dinosaurs roam, testosterone foams, below the streets, where the sewers and the rats run.The overwhelmingly brilliant performance comes from Marlon Brando, the rest of the cast essentially play themselves or a role they perpetually play, just watch any and all of their subsequent offerings.Does it work as well today? I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or wedding even better.I fondly remember Edward G. Robinson films being better than this, Jimmy Cagney even, George Raft was the best mob villain by a country mile."
tt0137523,"A difficult to understand film, that borders boring at some points, the fact that it has such a high rating is quite mind boggling. At some points interesting, but not the most thrilling piece of cinematography that I've seen, plays with the psychological aspects of humanity, and in the end is a confusing expo of a delusional persons realty, illustrated through ""fighting"" with ones self and then recruiting others to demonstrate similar violence as if it were to contribute in the bettering of individuals who ultimately degenerate in a seudo-terrorist activity and is only ended when one of the two polarities of the protagonist, causes a shot to his head, ending the personal torture of enduring this film."

tt0993846,""" The business of America is business "" screams an old clich√© but like so many clich√©s it's based on reality . Is there much difference between a gangster and a stockbroker ? It's the sign of a very poor mobster who can't make a profit for his firm and it's the same with the stock market . Thankfully capitalism is legal and every other socio-economic alternative has been a disaster for humanity but one can't help equating the stock exchange with being the same as gangsterism , supply and demand without any moral or humanitarian mores and one wonders how American auteur Martin Scorsese might bring a story of Wall Street to screen ? If there's a problem with Scorsese he sometimes remakes the same type of film as in THE KING OF COMEDY and BRINGING OUT THE DEAD are remakes of TAXI DRIVER . likewise GOODFELLAS was remade as CASINO .One can't help thinking the temptation to make a story featuring an amoral capitalist could quite easily end up becoming a gangster film set in the world of high finance . "" All my life I wanted to be a white collar criminal ""In effect this is how the film works to a large degree but Scorsese is on top of his game so having such a large similarity on a narrative and visual level with GOODFELLAS and CASINO doesn't matter because for a movie lasting three hours it just flies by . Once again Scorsese uses the directorial technique of intensified continuity which is film critic speak for in your face direction . All the Scorsese hallmarks are here , breaking down the figurative fourth wall , garish and glossy cinematography , constant camera movement , pumping intrusive music etc etc . It's all here and you've seen it all before but it's so well done that none of this matters and remains totally compelling as once again the master director brings us Shakespearean tragedy in its most American and cinematic formTo be fair to Jordan Belfort he didn't torture or kill anybody and his methods of gaining economic profit only differs from the rest of the finance sector in that they're illegal . Actually in amongst the excess of drugs , sex and foul language the storytelling doesn't make a very good job in telling the audience the difference between legal and illegal stockbroking but we're asked to take on board that Belfort isn't that bad because he's played by DiCaprio . Fair enough and he does a good job as a shallow and greedy boy who seduces stupid greedy people in handing over their cash . The rest of the cast also go along with the loud colourful style of the movie but was I puzzled by the one scene cameo by Mathew McConaughey in a pivotal role and kept expecting his character to make a reappearance at some point in the film which doesn't happen . . it'll be very ironic if as I expect McConaughey beats DiCaprio to the Oscar this year . A British audience might also find the casting of Joanna Lumley distracting in much the same way as Ray Winstone in THE DEPARTED , but the cinema audience I watched this with spent much of the running time laughing at the grotesque blackly comical scenes as they played out on screen . Mission accomplished Marty , although one can't help thinking an inclusion of a scene where Belfort passes a card warning a colleague about something is trying a little bit too hard to paint Belfort in a better light than he deserves . I mean it's not like anyone would be queuing up to listen to his lecture seminars after seeing this film is it now ?This is one of the better films from the long , prolific resume of Martin Scorsese , possibly his best since GOODFELLAS but one that will probably be very under rewarded at the prestigious award ceremonies due to one of the strongest film line ups seen in many years . It also won't convert anyone in to being a new found Scorsese fan but for those of us who's enjoyed his familiar language of cinema to tell a story about the American dream turning in to a nightmare it's proof once again that he's Hollywood's greatest living director."
tt0167260,"Congratulations Peter Jackson. Plenty of imagination is required to try and pull off a trilogy such as ""Lord Of The Rings"". Not to mention a country like New Zealand to film it in. It was just such a shame it was so boring.Now I admit I struggled through ""The Hobit"", and never gave ""Lord Of the Rings"" a chance in the paperback department. So I applaud your effort of keeping me a little interested throughout the movie. One of the two things that bothered me was the ridiculous length of the movie. I have three words that could have saved this movie from becoming a joke. POST PRODUCTION EDITING. I was laughing in the end at what a farce the movie had become.Perhaps the biggest disappointment was nothing to do with the movie but JRR Tolkien, who came up with surely the worst idea ever written on how a victory could be one. Writers block or just a cheap cheap sell out. You decide."
tt0120815,"Saving Private Ryan is a top WWII film and I've seen it a dozen times. As the film starts we are presented with a hundred or so ships coming across the sea. Suddenly violence erupts and soldiers are slaughtered on the D-Day Assualt. In the assualt, Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) leads his platoon up and around the German lines for a flank attack.Across the ocean, a mother receives three KIA letters in the same day but is promised that her youngest son, Private Ryan (Matt Damon) will be found in France and sent home. On the Normandy beach, Captain Miller and his platoon will be sent on a suicide mission across France to find Private Ryan and battle across the German lines. Through the whole mission the soldiers are pushed to the limit with the death of comrades and questioning of the mission.Steven Spielberg works his magic again with the presentation of one of the most honored war movies in film history. Tom Hanks is strong, smart and above all good as Captain Miller. There is also a surprise with one of Vin Diesel's first roles as Private Caparzo. The violence is brutal, bloody, and well crafted. Each character is interesting and their fears and weaknesses are each expressed in the film.Saving Private Ryan.

But is it the best ? Not even close. In its own category, it dominates most of the movies though, probably as good as Ironman and better than the first movie. Like most of the people, I am satisfied with the film but there are a few criticisms that I can make, about the fighting sequences, jokers screen time, and the process of the movie.First I wonder, why this film isn't called ""Joker""? Not only that Heath overshadows everyone with his performance, he also has incredible screen time as well, it is as if we are watching Joker as the main character, everything revolves around him. Maybe It was because there were too many characters in the movie, with separate goals and purposes, which also effected the process of the movie in my opinion. The story sometimes advanced too slow and sometimes too fast(but too fast in general) not allowing you to digest the theme fully.One other thing is the fighting sequences, the careography was not well made, most of the time it was too blunt, too dark and because of that, hard to perceive. Maybe it was the directors intention, but it kinda disturbed me, not being able to understand what was going on.To sum up it, the movie was just like I expected, but obviously below its hype, with a few deficiencies, a good movie in overall but definitely not a master piece."
tt0172495,"Well this film had much to offer. Absolutely nothing! I can understand why Mr. Scott is rated amongst bad directors. This film doesn't help him any more. But for the mainstream audience this film has got to be the best movie in years. The main stream audience is known for easily passing films like this one, as great. People say: Wow, look at the battle scenes in the beginning of the movie. To me it looks like just another battle scene. How can you differ one battle scene from another. It's difficult. If you people out there, wants to see great battle scenes, take a look at the movie ""War and Peace"". It has about 200,000 extras, and the scenes there, are much, much better than the one in Gladiator."
tt0137523,"To me this film is great in the sense that it provokes me enough to see messages perhaps exceeding the original intent of both the author and the film maker. The irony is that the film in really serves as a strong critique against the two main characteristics that Tylor represents: anti-establishment and masculinity.To begin with, the movie was produced by one of the biggest media corporates in the world, cashing on the corporate hatred and self- hatred generated precisely by those corporates. The crowd who followed Tylor thinking that they are liberated from the capitalist treadmill are in fact merely shifting from one treadmill to another. Same as the fascist followers who felt empowered carrying out the orders, in the process of working for Tylor they are really being exploited and given a tiny share of the power and resources they gathered - exactly the same as working for a company. Will their lives really change after credit records are destroyed? We have seen how communist revolutions rose and fell. What is, then, the whole point of the movement? It is a project of the protagonist set out to find his own value, instead of being defined by others. It is a process that requires internal examination and self-awareness. The crowd he draws is used for his personal project; eventually he becomes aware of his other self, Tylor, examined his own actions and those of Tylor's, and finds peace again with himself.Another mockery the film makes is towards the concept of masculinity. I quickly noticed the crowd drawn by Tylor consists only males, and the character itself is the projection of perfect masculinity perceived by the society. In a civilised society where powerful positions no longer require physical strength, certain male members feel a great sense of insecurity ‚Äì exactly the members fight club attracts. Frustrated by their failure to gain influence in the establishment, they go to the gym and boxing clubs to regain confidence, or engage in reckless behaviours to show how daring they are. The film portrayed these people as flat in character and seemingly stupid. The only trait that sets Tylor apart from them is his intelligence. In fact, it was the intelligent part of him that woke him up from the corporate slavery, not the masculine part. Violence and sex are used as a tool to express power, but after the short-lived pleasure derived from the power trip, the ensuing wounds and pain are long-lasting. While Tylor dominated Marla in bed, the protagonist does not even feel the pleasure from sex. In the end, the feminine and powerless Marla saves the protagonist by reconnecting the conflicting parts of him and completes his self- searching journey.My mood was manipulated by the film the first time I saw it; the motivational speech about self-discovery and pursuit of passion sold me. But when I realised they were blindly targeting companies, I suddenly realised the stupidity of the ideology with which the crowd was bonded, and from that departure, I felt alienated from the protagonist and from the film and was able to see the bigger picture. From the interviews of the author and the director I did not see the same interpretation I had, however, I believe an art piece has its own life after its creation. From cinematographic perspective, this is a very well made film. Once again Fincher did an excellent job. I recommend this film."
tt0109830,"More than adaptation , it is a visual parable. About vulnerability and its magnificent potential. About innocence and its importance to discover the real essence of life. About love, family, fight and courage. A film like a revolution. Because it propose the best manner to be yourself and to not be a victim walking on that way. More than story of Forrest Gump, it is the story of people around him. A film like a Rubick cube - many faces, each for complete right color. And a image who remains its mark - the box of chocolate, the run, the ping - pong match. It seems be the best role of Tom Hanks. In fact, it is definition of a new period after the Cold War. A pledge. About the small things."
tt0137523,"My husband talked me into this after time and time again saying ""I don't want to watch a movie about fighting"", I guess he thought the beginning was better than I thought it was...I guess if you get kicks out of people whose lives are completely the dumps then watch this movie.  It's only mildly amusing before the fighting if you're a mentally stable person."
tt7286456,"Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway."
tt0397103,"I've been fortunate enough to have been on 3 Operation Smile missions and I'm leaving for my 4th in a couple of weeks. I found that this movie did a great job of creating the atmosphere of being on a mission.I noticed that some of the review presented a very cynical view of how these missions are conducted- i.e.- Americans have to go to these countries to show the natives how to repair their babies. Those reviewers didn't pay close enough attention to the movie to see that the surgical team who operated on Lin was Chinese. Apart from the movie, Operation Smile's goal is to collaborate with the Op Smile chapters in each country to promote the development of their medical personnel so they can run their own missions.Anyway back to ""Smile"", it gives an accurate portrayal of the positive, life-changing effect that one can get from helping another human being and it matches my experiences with Op Smile."
tt1853728,"Django Unchained is a bit of a conundrum, largely in part due to it's creator Quentin Tarantino. I have had long love/hate relationship with his movies. When he debuted in 90's with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction I rode shotgun on the Tarantino bandwagon, but as time wore on and more and more of his personality came to light I started to sour. Tarantino strikes me as that kid in middle school that got crammed in a trashcan and rolled down the hill and who was rejected by cheerleaders in high school. He has spent the rest of his life trying to prove to all of us that he really is cool. That desperation for hipness bleeds through in everything he makes. This is not to say he is without talent because he does have a sharp eye and a feel for jaunty banter. He also has a encyclopedic knowledge of film history and flair for homage. That can be double edge sword though, what differentiates insightful reference and a lack of his own voice?That brings us back to Django Unchained which is Tarantino's spin on spaghetti westerns. It's Tarantino through and through. From soundtrack to visuals it all screams ""LOOK HOW COOL I AM!"" and occasionally it's right. There are scenes that feature genuine humor and visual flash as well as some solid performances in particular from Sam Jackson, who steals all of his scenes. All of this is smothered in Tarantino juice and there's the rub. If you love him you'll the love movie but if you think he's a pretentious douche bag this movie won't change your opinion. So many of his conceits took me right out of the movie from his typical ""hip"" soundtrack to Jamie Foxx's sunglasses.Django Unchained like most of Tarantino's movies is unapologetic in it's violence and often wanders the gray wastes of where just tasteless ends and where offensive begins. One has to question if he makes these forays for anything other then shock value. Despite all of Tarantino's efforts, he doesn't quite drive me away. Beneath it all Django Unchained is a serviceable revenge tale with several water cooler moments but beyond that? ... More shock then awe.... and this has been The Mack Minute.

tt0068646,This is one of very few movies that shook the film industry !!
tt1345836,"The Dark Knight Rises is the third and final installment in director Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. The story takes places eight years after the events of the last film, eight years since Batman vanished into the night and assumed responsibility for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent in the hopes that it would benefit the greater good. But when a new villain threatens to destroy Gotham City and cannot be stopped by law enforcement alone, Bruce Wayne is forced to adorn the black armor once again.The film introduces several new characters: John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young police officer whose loyalty lies in doing what is right and not blindly following his superiors. Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), a cat burglar working for Bane in hopes of obtaining a device that will erase a person's criminal history and giving her the chance to start a new life. Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard), who encourages Bruce Wayne to rejoin the rest of the world and continue his father's philanthropic work. Loyal butler, Alfred (Sir Michael Caine), Commissioner of the Gotham Police, James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and genius inventor, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), also make a return to help Bruce Wayne become the Dark Knight once more. A new villain also enters the fray that is just as intelligent, resourceful and a better combatant than Batman (even breaking Batman's back at one point, depicting a classic scene from the comic series) ‚Äì Bane (Tom Hardy), a terrorist portraying himself as a liberator of the people.Production staff really outdid themselves in making this film superb in every detail. In regards to the dramatic aspect, filming took place in several different cities across the world including New York, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, London and Jodhpur. By amalgamating different cities, staff members helped to make his imagination of Gotham resemble the description of the city given in the comics. Costume specialists helped to give Bain the appearance of a lucha libre (masked wrestler), which coupled with his resourcefulness and intelligence helped to create the perfect villain.The Dark Knight Rises takes place in an apocalyptic time with nuclear warfare threatening to destroy Gotham City. Cinematography experts helped to reinforce this doomsday ambiance by having Bane and his henchmen blow up all the bridges that lead out to the city, trapping the entire police force underground and unleashing the hooligans from the city jail in a scene that resembles the ""Storming of the Bastille"". The federal government also abandons Gotham, leaving the people of Gotham to fight the battle on their own. Even scenes that do not take place in the city show the helplessness of the times. When Bruce Wayne is imprisoned in foreign jail, Bane decides to ""torture his soul"" by having him watch the events unfold in Gotham on a television set while he is trapped in a virtually inescapable prison.Director Christopher Nolan stated that this film would mark the end of his interpretation of the Batman trilogy. However, the end of the film leaves the viewer with a final surprise: John Blake's legal is revealed to be Robin John Blake, a reference to Batman's comic book sidekick, and inherits the Batcave after Batman's ""demise"". This leaves the possibility open to an additional installment in the Batman franchise, and with the critical and financial success of the series, it may be a smart move for Warner Brother's to make (copyright owner's to the series).The film also leaves the viewers with a final message: a hero can be anyone. Whether it is placing a reassuring grasp on the shoulders friend, letting him know that things will get better, or helping a stranger on the side of the road who is having car troubles. Nolan's final episode is an earnest attempt to give a deserving end to a much-loved series. With cool gadgets, fast-paced chase and fight scenes, complex characters, and a story line that will keep you on the edge of your seat, fans of the Batman series will not be disappointed."
tt0068646,"A good job I saw it when it was originally released in the cinema.Because it has never been worth watching since. I usually lose interest after the first party sequence.At the time this was a groundbreaking film, with an excellent performance from Marlon Brando, it's easy to see why they paid him his astronomical fee despite his short time on screen, and it could well have been a momentous flop without him.But this film definitely does not stand the test of time, unlike say 'Goodfellas' 'African Queen' Spartacus etc, very few films do.How it got to number one is beyond comprehension, a very minor classic at best, which has since been done to death by the even more inferior clones, nowadays all very dreary and boring.'Lawrence of Arabia' now there's a film really worthy of the number 1 spot."
tt0993846,"Excessive sex and scenes like the part were Donny was giving his money to the dude from Walking Dead, yea that dude Shane. The sex scenes made me uneasy in the theaters but the old dudes three rows below me loved it. I think to me the main focus was on the drug and sex scenes. The last time Jordan(Leonardo) had sex with his soon to be ex wife made me think of his wife in the movie as Bar Refaeli. I'm like damn! Leo you lucky bastard! Right now I feel like a song coming up. Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens Brown paper packages tied up with strings These are a few of my favorite thingsCream colored ponies and crisp apple streudels Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings These are a few of my favorite thingsGirls in white dresses with blue satin sashes Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes Silver white winters that melt into springs These are a few of my favorite thingsWhen the dog bites When the bee stings When I'm feeling sad I simply remember my favorite things And then I don't feel so bad.I'm giving this movie three stars because I like Leo, I became a fan after his movie with his best buds Toby and Jerry Maguire."
tt1853728,"I am not a weapons expert but know enough that the rifles and pistols used in the film predate their actual existence. This fact and the plot itself help turn the movie from fantasy to fantastical. For such a movie to succeed the characters had best be living in a fantastical place, which as depicted it is not. But fantastical things happen regularly, such as a man drawing while covered against a cocked shotgun and easily killing the holder without the shotgun firing. Or a derringer appearing out of a skin tight shirt sleeve, the never missed shots by the stars, the almost instantaneous transformation by a slave who had never touched a gun into Bill Hickok. All of these could be accepted, perhaps, if the depictions of just about everybody in the film did not seem slightly off key. They just don't quite fit, including the Oscar winner Waltz who unlike his perfect and even superhuman performance in Inglorious Bastards has to make ends meet with a very imperfectly written character. He does his best, the movie is well acted by DiCaprio as usual and all the secondary characters except Tarantino who by now should realize his talents do not extend to his acting. The movie plays like a bunch of parts installed to satisfy needs, rather than create a cohesive whole which is something Tarantino in Pulp Fiction, for example was brilliant at deflecting. Better luck next time."
tt0816692,"I'm really sorry. I so much wanted to like this film. So much has gone into it and the concept is good, but it just didn't work for me.I found this to be a compact and fanciful story stretched up to intergalactically implausible proportions. It didn't ring true, and it was full of Hollywood formulae, like clumsy cliffhangers. And why did we have to have a Western-style fight scene on an icy planet on the other side of a black hole? There were no punches thrown in 2001.People will say it was too long but it wouldn't be any better if it was shorter. It is also an unremittingly dark and depressing film except for certain aspects. The brilliant special effects, loud sound track and music served to mask the shortcomings.On the plus side it is thought-provoking about space and physics, the actors gave everything, especially the main character, he was brilliant - it didn't have George Clooney in it a big plus. The concept is excellent, and it dramatises aspects of Einstein's theory of relativity such as meeting your children who have grown older than you.I hope a lot of people like it, as I wouldn't want all that effort and commitment to go to waste, so just ignore my opinion! Go and watch it and make up your own mind!"
tt0167261,"What a disappointment compared to FOTR.Too much of the film focuses on King Theoden, in which he is misinterpreted through constantly driveling, mamsy-pamsy lines.Too much of the film focuses on Eowyn, in which she is misinterpreted as a wallflower.Faramir's character is completely misinterpreted.  In the movie, he resembles his brother, not the cool, contemplative scholar/soldier nor the shadow of Aragorn as he was well delineated as being in the book.Though Gimli provides some much enriching comic relief; by the end of the film, you get the feeling that he is used solely for comic relief.Sure, all the visual craft is there. (Yea!) And Gollum's script and dramatic posturing are even more impressive than the masterful CGI rendering of him. (Yea!) The Ents are wonderfully captured. (Yea!) (Though the rescripting of their activities was another disappointment.)I could rationalize the plot changes in LOTR, but as I watched this film, I was rationalizing a lot.  My rationalizations stopped when the misinterpretation of Faramir, (and to a lesser extend) Theoden, and Eowen overwhelmed me into bitterness.I was expecting this trilogy to be one for the ages.  My expectations are shattered."
tt0137523,"Ever since I first watched this movie a few years back with some of my friends, I loved it. It became a sort of habit of ours to watch it every couple weeks or at least once a month while we laughed and quoted the whole thing for fun. 
 Anyways, what makes this movie better than what the 1999 box office credited it with, is the filmography. My favorite use of camera and film techniques probably had to be the moment where Tyler describes the meaningless of possessions in a shot inside their house as it wobbles from side to side. His calm demeanor reminds you more of Jack rather than himself and his more aggressive tone, creating a sense of foreshadowing the ultimate climax when Jack realizes he is Tyler and Tyler is him. It's also very interesting to see the change from a clear and sunny day in the city to the yellow-tinted bars, basements, and ultimately the abandoned house Jack and Tyler live in at night. There's a feeling of the underground's grime and dirt in these transitions, as well as a feel for the tougher moments in life that are a central theme in this movie.
 This movie also made a high ranking for me because it makes you think. In 1999, people were looking for stability in the shadow of Y2K. They weren't thinking about giving up everything they had, but preserving it and gathering more possessions, as highlighted throughout the film yet again as a central theme. This film goes exactly against contemporary consumer society at the time by instead of telling people to ""buy stuff we don't need"", it emphasizes the ideas of minimalism and even tribalism in some aspects when Tyler talks about ""starting over"" again. What sticks with this movie is that it's message still sticks to us today, perhaps even stronger than in 1999."
tt0120737,"Barely ever hearing of The Lord of the Rings, I went in to see this film in theaters the consecutive Friday it was released, to not only be flabbergasted at its greatness, but wanting more! Since then, I devoted myself to seeing the following two films on the first day of release -- a promise I kept.Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece not only carries a great deal of the text to full film fruition, but shows the power of film, and proving that nothing is impossible. Jackson's vision is continuous, and never seems to loose grasp of the story that is being told. Using the artistry of John Howe and Alan Lee, The Fellowship of the Ring gleams with a beautiful and dark atmosphere, a length of detail that makes it seem like everyone and everything has its own history, and full of wondrous images one could never imagine.The acting is superb. With a complex script, each actor has transformed these characters into 3-D people with deep back-story, and people that we feel compassion for. This is one extraordinary ensemble cast. Each actor IS that character, making it seem impossible to imagine anyone else fill that person's shoe in their stead. Viggo Mortensen IS Aragorn. Sir Ian McKellen IS Gandalf the Grey. Elijah Wood IS Frodo Baggins. One could weep with our heroes should one fall, or feel inspired when they achieve victory. A fantasy with this much emotion just seems surreal, but it's completely believable.Never losing pace, the writing and direction is flawless, making for one enthralling introduction into Middle-earth. The voice over prologue fills even the most uneducated audience member with all the necessary knowledge they need to know in order to understand our heroes' and villains' motives. Some things of course have been omitted for pacing reasons. While not present in the theatrical cut, we do see the passing of the Grey Elves, and get a brief tale of Beren and Luthien. The barrow-wights and their story is no where to be seen (as interesting as it is in the book, there really is no place for it in this film) and Tom Bombadil is absent as well, but thankfully to the ingeniousness of the writers, in the Extended Edition of The Two Towers a little homage is paid to the character. Omissions and changes are always part of adapting a book to film, and the ones made by Peter Jackson, Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh are justifiable in every way.The action scenes are spaced out thoroughly enough for breathing room, plot advancement, and ever-continuing character development. Each action scene is its own, be it the flight to the Fjords of Bruinen, the Mines of Moria, or the showdown at Amon Hen near the end of the film. All are greatly choreographed, each stunt member and actor is full of energy and ambition as they wield deadly weapons at each others' heads and limbs. It really is a sight to behold.The special effects are mesmerizing. The use of CGI, miniatures/bigatures, and even clever camera angles blend to make one ideal image after the other. The soaring images of Barad-dur or Orthanc seem real when in fact, they only stand so many feet high. The Argonath, two figures of enormous height standing before the Anduin River seem like 300 foot creations, when in fact they are about only several feet off the ground. Simply jaw-dropping imagery.Howard Shore's score for The Fellowship of the Ring is a beautiful, epic, and complex piece of work that makes one feel like they have been entranced. Even when some of the text seems omitted from the screen, it can be heard through the powerful instrumentation conducted and created by this composer. The use of leitmotifs to symbolize a country, race, or character is stunning.Overall, The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring is a visionary masterpiece, allowing the world to see what seems like actual history with fantastic elements, equaling the greatness of Hollywood's earlier classics. As the first of three, one who has not seen these films can await the next several hours of their lives to be changed for ever."
tt0361748,"Wow! Every single time I watch this movie I am completely engaged and excited by it.The acting is incredible and Hans Landa is one of the best characters ever written in film history.The story is captivating with twists that make the film impossible to look away from.The feel of the movie is so immersive that without the sometimes comical arrows and signs, I sometimes forget I'm even watching a movie and not in the moment with the characters.This is the pinnacle of film making in my opinion and the silly, dark, and comedic moments of the film make it an absolute masterpiece."
tt0133093,"So much greatness about this well done crafty philosophical masterpiece! One of the greatest films ever made; a true benchmark in cinema and huge meticulously brilliant cabinet file of important metaphors. I smile so much while watching The Matrix, I'm so happy it had a 20th anniversary. I'm beyond intrigued by these types of society thought-provoking gems; there aren't enough of them!!"
tt0109830,I think the story was quite different from other movies and the characters performed well and justify their characters.
tt1853728,"I love Spaghetti westerns. I love A fistful of dollars, for a few dollars more, and of course the movie that defines Spaghetti westerns... The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Yeah... Django Unchained doesn't even begin to hold a candle to any of those classics. The truth is I liked the performances. Christoph Waltz and Jamie Foxx were excellent. Even Leonardo Dicaprio's performance was okay. However, and this is a BIG however, this film, much like many of Tarantino's most recent works, needs editing, BADLY! I really didn't like Inglorious Basterds that much, and I don't like a lot of Tarantino's films because I feel the characters lack humanity. However... the characters Django and Doctor Schultz have some humanity in them. But did that raise this movie up? No it didn't! Instead, we get thirty gallons of blood spurting every other damn time somebody fires a gun, we get long stretches of movie that don't need to be there, and as a result I honestly believe the final product suffers from the unmitigated run time.Let's face it, the very inappropriate rap music hurts the film too. This is supposed to be a SPAGHETTI western! Not a damn Gangsta Drama set in the east side homie!!! Annoyed yet? Good, now you know how I felt because of the anachronistic soundtrack. Now, I admit there are times when anachronistic music can do a movie good(See Moulin Rouge), but there is no excuse in Heaven, Earth or(Yes, even Hell) that you can give me where we have to have frickin' gangsta rap playing over the soundtrack... OF A MOVIE TAKING PLACE IN THE 1850's!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm sorry, this just makes me so damn angry you can't even imagine.The gore and the blood and the unnecessary visceral details and the prolific use of the N-word detracts from this movie so badly that it does not feel anything like a genuine spaghetti western, not even close. I'll tell you why right now: I can't ever imagine ever watching Django Unchained ever again in my lifetime. It's just a soulless little movie that left me unhappy and regretting that I didn't go see Les Miserables instead."
tt0137523,"This might be the stoopidest movie ever made. The story is ridiculous, the twist beyond retarded.Spoiler ALERTOooh Brad Pitt IS Ed Norton. Is this supposed to be deep?Given what passes as intellectualism and political discourse in this country, it is no wonder that this film is heralded as a masterpiece. I give major props to Fincher for imbuing this piece of idiocy with great style. The lighting and clothes are top -notch. But that does not make for a good movie. I'm sure to teenage bozos, this is about something. To anyone with a brain it is pure dreck.Is that supposed to be funny? Is it supposed to be insightful? What it leaves one with, is a feeling that Brad Pitt sure wishes he was cooler than he is."
tt0167261,"Well, I'll be darned if this isn't one of the best epic movies I've ever seen in my life. And am ever likely TO see in my life. Following in the footsteps of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, Peter Jackson's second instalment of the trilogy ups the ante tenfold, offering one amazing movie packed with heart, action, romance, dazzling effects, and brilliant characters. Thankfully free of the time-consuming introduction needed to begin the first part of Tolkien's trilogy, Jackson now has time to focus on developing characters, perilous quests, and, of course, out-and-out action. I'm an action lover at heart so I was in seventh heaven watching this movie. Everything you could want from the second book is here, up on screen and even more amazing than Tolkien could render. Plus, Jackson has done his magic and inserted a few memorable scenes of his own so there are plenty of surprises even for those who know whats coming.Where to begin with such a film? The characters, I guess. Jackson takes the option of cross-cutting repeatedly between the three different sets of principal characters and his method pays off nicely, offering a well-rounded film that never lets up with the drama (I was astonished that three hours had passed by the time this was over ‚Äì it felt more like just one hour). Merry and Pippin's encounter with the Ents is awe-inspiring stuff. Of course, a walking tree is a hard thing to portray, but with the aid of some outstanding special effects Jackson does it and does it so superbly. Then we have Frodo and Sam crossing the dead marshes (complete with creepy corpse ghosts ‚Äì the horror imagery is strong in this movie folks, and Jackson doesn't skimp on the splatter either) and meeting up with totally CGI-created Gollum. Gollum is fantastic, a breath of life straight from the book; Andy Serkis does wonders with his voice and movements and helps to craft the flawed, schizophrenic psychology of the ugly but hugely sympathetic creature.The main action, of course, comes from the whole Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli storyline, mixing in plenty of incident and nasty creatures along the way. The bear-like Whargs are violent and unpleasant; the Oliphants are amusing and breathtaking in equal measure; the Nazgul and their winged demons are fantastic to behold. Visually, the film is always spectacular, splendid and sweeping; it makes even better use of the varied New Zealand countryside than the last film which is no mean feat. Howard Shore's sweeping score is better than before and highlights the evocative nature of the movie, often threatening to overwhelm us with the sheer wonder of it all. This IS Tolkien.Of course, the movie finishes off with the battle of Helm's Deep, a forty-minute non-stop barrage of carnage and destruction, explosions, mayhem and might. It's easily one of the best battles ever put on film and the special effects are entirely convincing (as they are throughout). I'll confess that I was close to tears at a couple of points ‚Äì the white light streaming onto the battlefield, the breaking of the dam at Isengard ‚Äì these flawless moments just choked me up and made me glad to be able to appreciate the true wonder of cinema. The cast is flawless ‚Äì exemplary performances from the recurring cast members, kudos to newcomers Brad Dourif, Miranda Otto, and Karl Urban, and especial mention to Bernard Hill. Nothing more can be said. A modern classic I'm only too privileged to have seen on its opening night."
tt0468569,"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."
tt0172495,"I saw Gladiator this weekend and I have to say I'm not sure what all the hype was about. The story is only fair and the characters flat; and, at over two and a half hours, there was ample time for much better story and character development.  Unlike Braveheart, and The Patriot, two other recent period epics, I was never drawn into the story, never became involved emotionally with the characters, never really cared. And, Crowe seems to play the same character in many of his movies; it's time for less grunting. It was nice to see Richard Harris, I wish he'd do more.If you see it, see it for the scenery and the special effects; they are FANTASTIC.  I remember watching Titanic and being able to pick out the people and scenery that was computer generated. Not so in Gladiator.  Rome looks like it's real, nothing short of amazing.The blood and gore, if you worry about that kind of thing, wasn't as bad as some have said; in fact, there was much less than I expected.Worth the time if you must. But ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" was better."
tt0816692,"His 4th dud in a row, a ridiculous plot, for some reason the earth is reduced to only producing corn, so no animals, birds or fish, even though the scene by a lake the water looked clean and refreshing. Seems like humanity have forgotten that we can grow things in greenhouses and even underground. never mind lets move on, once again Nolan's characters all scientists and supposedly super intelligent do the most stupid things. anne hathaway goes in the water to retrieve a large piece of debris when a large wave appears, she has on hand a robot who could lift this wreckage with one hand but does not instruct him to do so, the beardy scientist is by the spacecraft door urging her to get a move on, the wave gets nearer the robot goes and carries her to the shuttle, the beardy scientist all this while stays put just outside the door and lets the wave carry him away, just one example of quite few.the biggest plot hole is this, for some reason once cooper is past the black hole and in 5 dimensional space, he becomes super intelligient, because he now knows how to solve the problem of gravity and save mankind, how he knows this we do not know, given that he is just an engineer to be able to figure out something the greatest physicists of the last hundred years cannot is unbelievable, he then sends probably the most complicated and long equation in history to his daughter in basic morse code, anyone familiar with morse code will tell you that this would take forever. now to the film making, others have mentioned its look , well to me it looked shabby, endless shots of aircraft wings, no vistas no shots of the galaxy or stars. during both the wormhole sequence and the black hole sequence he stays on the actors in close. in fact thank God i did not see this in imax, would have been a complete waste of time. and now the noise, with hans zimmer's worst and most bombastic score , added onto very loud sound effects, with the actors shouting to be heard we came a away with very bad headaches. the end did not make any sense at all. but we have the usual nolan fan base that cannot see past their noses all going ape over this and the usual batch of critics with no critical faculties whatsover."
tt0114369,"""Se7en"" was the serial killer movie of the week at the time of its release. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt--apparently representing Reason and Passion, respectively--are cops on the trail of a serial killer. Kevin Spacey plays the killer as a Hannibal Lecter wannabe with a vengeful-angry-God complex: he bumps his victims off in ways that reflect the Seven Deadly Sins.  Not a new idea; Vincent Price made two similarly-constructed movies in the '70s: ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes,"" in which the inspiration is the ten curses of Pharaoh in the book of Exodus; and ""Theater of Blood,"" in which Shakespeare's plays provide the motifs.  (""Se7en"" makes a nod in the direction of its predecessors by mentioning the ""pound of flesh"" associated with one of the murders.)The difference is that the Price movies were jet-black comedies, while ""Se7en"" is a straightforward suspense thriller, and a relentlessly grim, gray, dark, rain-soaked one at that.  It's technically well-made and unusually literate, drawing themes from Dante, Milton, Shakespeare, and medieval theology.  And there's a strong echo of Dostoevsky's ""Notes from the Underground"": when the killer's lair is located, it's found to contain 2000 handwritten notebook journals of 250 pages each.  (Quibbles: if he writes that much, when does he find time to do anything else... such as plan and execute fiendishly clever crimes?  Also, we're told that none of the journals or entries are dated.  As one who has kept a daily journal for ten years, I find that unlikely, especially since the killer is ultimately revealed to be even more, shall we say, detail-oriented than I am.)The movie's ending (which I won't reveal here) is distressingly downbeat--and surprisingly so, as well.  It leaves a nasty aftertaste.  It could be argued that anything less would've been a cop-out, but it still was about as entertaining as a sucker punch.  ""The Silence of the Lambs"" left us with Lecter on the loose, but at least there was salvation (the girl was rescued), redemption (the lambs were silenced), and retribution (the killer was dispatched without the incidental destruction of anyone else).  By contrast, ""Se7en,"" which offers none of the above, is easy to admire, but hard to enjoy."
tt0372784,"Director Christopher Nolan pulls out all the stops as he embarks on solidifying Batman lore with his retelling of how one Bruce Wayne became the capped crusader Batman. Nolan dazzles in many scenes and is always rock solid, never resorting to cheap humor or unnecessary special effects. This Batman is a dark tale that explains why Batman is the person he is, why he became the person he was to be, and what lies ahead. Christian Bales does a credible job in the lead. He is surrounded by first-rate performers lending their experience and acting savvy: Michael Caine as Alfred(very, very good), Morgan Freeman as Luscious(very, very good), Gary Oldman as policeman Gordon(very good) and villains Liam Neeson(very good), the ever impressive Tom Wilkinson(excellent), and Cillian Murphy(very good). Rutger Hauer is also along as is Katie Holmes(big deal huh?) I really enjoyed this film and was impressed with its cohesiveness and strong script. The script, the direction, the acting, the sets, and the special effects all blend together and make a fine film and probably the definitive Batman film to date. I know many people will compare this to the two Burton films - both good films in their own way. But this Batman is not that Batman. There are no one-liners here and there mixed in with an occasional over-blown scene. This film is a very serious take on a very serious man that has devoted his life to stopping crime in Gotham."
tt0102926,"Watched it this year (2021) for the first time. I really liked it. I've never felt so tense while watching a movie as I did watching this one, and I think that's proof of the great acting and cinematography in general!"
tt7286456,"Cinematography, costume design and one powerhouse performance do not a good movie make. In truth, Joker is poorly paced with a lackluster story that Frankenstiens together elements from The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. It borrows so liberally I'm amazed it didn't get hit with a plagiarism lawsuit.Additionally, the movie has the subtlety of a sledgehammer. It's sociological commentary is ham-fisted and bland, and it lacks any truly jaw-dropping moments. Outside of the Talk Show scene and a single shot near the end, it's all very forgettable.And the song for the stair dance sequence was so colossally stupid it completely pulled me out of the film.That being said, Joaquin was great and the aforementioned cinematography and costume design were very solid. All in all, the movie coasts on Phoenix's mesmerizing portrayal, but never goes far enough to really get under your skin. Biggest letdown of the year."
tt0381429,"These days films are full of CGI, well known names, huge budgets and marketing campaigns. Yet they only last for few moments.Of course, we all value different things in films. For some it's the acting quality that matters, for others it's the aforementioned CGI. Then some prefer the films to have great script, or direction.What this particular film is about is photography. It's one of these rare gems where no matter what the story is, and no matter how bad actors are, if you appreciate photography and art, this picture will captivate you and glue you to your armchair or whatever you might be sitting on at the time for next couple of hours.It's no to say that the acting was bad. I'm not an expert by any means but I didn't find anything wrong there. The story isn't bad either. It might even stand out in some ways from your usual plot.And the soundtrack is as beautiful as the photography.That's why the 8 from me. If it wasn't for the beauty of the shots, I would probably give it a 6 or 7, but that particular beauty will remind me of itself from time to time and I'm sure I'll watch this film a few times more."
tt0120815,"Very weak plot. And unnecessary and shallow additions to amplify the sentimentality of some scenes.1. The inclusion of translator, and he does has some very important roles - lets go of the German soldier earlier in the movie who comes back to shoot the captain later in the movie (a little bit over dramatic)2. The said translator has zero shooting skills. What is he doing there in the middle of a war zone. Even medics are trained to shoot when required.3. Again the same translator cannot climb a set of stairs to deliver ammo to his fellow soldier as he is scared.4. And soldiers moving through entire length of wide roads without getting shot by 10/20 German soldiers right across.5. The movie was decent for the first 3 quarters. But once Damon comes in, somehow I didn't feel Damon's acting and his pain that well. Especially the part where he recounts the story of his brothers lighting up a barn. And he is supposed to have been there in the zone for a long time. But has complete white washed teeth. Somehow feels very off with the character at that point. And i'm saying all this while still being a huge fan of Damon.Having said all that, there are indeed some parts which are good to watch, the camaraderie of the group is enjoyable throughout. There are attempts to portray the horrors of the war up close."
tt0422272,"When it comes to the horror genre, I'm a ""Been there, done that, and always willing to do it again"" kind of guy. I love horror movies. My expectations, however, were not high for this film, which I saw after an attempt at watching the director's previous effort, Darkness (don't bother--it's a dull, incomprehensible mess). But there were some genuinely intriguing moments early on in Fragile--particularly when the viewer is first introduced to the idea of the ""mechanical girl"" and what she does to the children. Still, as the story progresses, one soon realizes there is nothing actually original in this somewhat pedestrian ghost story. And yet I must say that despite this, I was nevertheless entertained by the director's artful manipulation of the conventions. Fragile looks good--the atmosphere is great, the ghost is scary-looking, and the cast more than competent and believable. It's not a perfect film by any means, but for this genre fanatic, it was just fine for a rainy Saturday afternoon."
tt0993846,"In the mid-1990s, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) and the rest of his associates from brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont became the very definition of excess and debauchery, their offices a boiler room fueled by cocaine and greed. High pressure sales tactic and less-than-legal behind-the-scenes manipulation bred plenty of twenty-something millionaires, and Belfort built himself an empire at the top of the heap. His rise and fall is chronicled in The Wolf of Wall Street, based on the memoir of the same name.Under most circumstances, the actions of Belfort and his cronies (including Jonah Hill in a howlingly funny turn as Belfort's business partner) would be viewed as disgustingly abhorrent, but Martin Scorsese frames this tale of greed with a comedic lens that allows us to laugh at things we probably shouldn't find humorous. Whether it's a clumsy attempt at fisticuffs between two characters overdosing on Quaaludes, or the categorization of prostitutes using stock market terminology (""blue chip"" hookers make you wear a condom and typically accept credit cards), the film is outrageous from start to finish, and rarely falters in its quest to entertain the audience for three hours.Belfort manages to delude himself and his pals into thinking they can live like this forever, but the audience knows better, and Belfort's eventual comeuppance is hardly surprising. But the path is paved with hilarity, especially in a scene aboard the mogul's luxury yacht, where he surreptitiously offers a pair of FBI agents everything from booze to girls to cold hard cash in exchange for their silence. And let's not forget his punishment for drunkenly piloting a helicopter into the backyard of his estate at 3am, raising the ire of his trophy wife (Margot Robbie).Scorsese has always managed to elicit astounding performances from his actors, and his fifth collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio results in one of the most charismatic, despicable, offensive and captivating characters to ever appear on screen. As financial bad boy Belfort, DiCaprio swaggers from scene to scene ingesting eye-popping amounts of narcotics, groping and fondling nearly every female within reach, and spouting more profanity in three hours than an entire season of The Sopranos. Belfort is the kind of person that any sane person would detest in real life, but thanks to Scorses and DiCaprio, we can't take our eyes off him.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com"
tt0120737,"This movie loses a lot from the book, and all it adds are a few special effects.The first five minutes are cool -- everybody seems to love that part.  Then the movie becomes too slow, too formulaic.  ""Look here, this is where you feel sad.  This is where you cheer.  This is where you say 'ooh, ahh'...""A movie can enhance a book by adding dialogue.  But in this film, the script is a series of monologues.  The characters give speech after speech, and it becomes hard to tell them apart because they're all approximately the same.When they're not talking, there are a few good action sequences, but most of the time it's characters posing, wallowing in self-pity."
tt0120737,"First of all, I think this film suffered due to the arrogance of the filmakers. Before it's release, the cast and crew were going around saying things like ""you've never seen anything like this!"" and ""I cried and you will to!"".Well sorry but I have this before. ALL OF IT! There is absolutely nothing in this film that is new and in fact it seems in places like a cut and paste job from other movies.Sleepy Hollow, Jason and the Argonauts, First Knight, Camelot, Willow, The Ten Commandments, and so on. They're all represented here and some of the shots are identical to shots in those movies.And no I didn't cry because ALL of the characters are so unlikeable.What you have here is a bunch of second rate actors(Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee aside} portraying a bunch of unlikeable and dull characters. Characters who for most of the movie, run away, meet some bad guys, run away, meet some more bad guys, run away again and this keeps happening until the end. Except there is no end!!!!  It just stops in a cynical ploy to get you to go and see the next movie.The story is boring and has no narrative drive. It's supposed to be an adventure story but where is the adventure?! There is no tension or excitement. And the action scenes are so muddled that it shows Peter Jackson up for the amature that he is. He should have stuck to B movies.The plot is ridiculous. A magic ring which somehow has magic powers must be taken to the ""Dark Gloomy Mountain Of Murder"" or something like that, and our ""heroes"" decide to do it without any real questions.From then we meet a mirage of incredibly embarassing creatures like Elves and Goblins and some CGI monsters which are so badly animated that it takes any realism out of the film.But the worst thing is that everyone takes things so incredibly serious! Are you not allowed to laugh in middle-earth? Everyone is so po-faced.The film has no zip. No spark and is instantly forgettable."
tt0102926,"""Silence of the Lambs"" is one of those movies a person could watch over and over again and never get bored.  The mixture of acting, screenplay, and direction make it one of the jewels of American cinema."
tt0816692,"This film is 2 hours and 49 minutes of slowly bleeding to death. The magnitude of actors is the only one thing that keeps my attention (e.g. when is Matt Damon inserted into this?). Such a disappointment. I'm very pleased that I waited until this was available on streaming services.The beginning, while slow and lacking character development (and somewhat unbelievable), is interesting. The end is completely ridiculous. I had a flashback to ""The Fifth Element"" where it was declared that love was the 5th element. Too much time spent on irrelevant side stories that added nothing. The ending is difficult to find realistic or plausible. I found myself wondering how this movie could have such high ratings on IMDb after being released over 1 year ago!As a scientist/engineer, I wanted to enjoy this film. I was woefully disappointed.For anyone interested, I'd watch The Martian long before watching this drivel. I'm shocked that this is #29 in IMDb's ""Top Rated Movies"", how did that happen?Brings into question how reliable IMDb really is with respect to objective movie reviews."
tt0108052,This movie leads us through a dark side of world war 2. It shows us the horrors of the Holocaust without being too shocking nor ignoring the reality. The movie's running time is quite long (over 3 hours) but still the story line and the cinematography can capture us within the movie with ease. The cinematography is original with it's choice of black/white colours with some rare colours that gives meaning in emotional scenes. A real masterwork that should be seen!
tt0133093,"I made every effort to be open minded about ""The Matrix."" I put aside such questions as ""Why does Hollywood see Keanu as a cyberpunk? How came everyone is making making a big deal about these fx which you can see in shampoo commercials?"" I can honestly say I gave it every chance. The fact that the creators were trying to create fully developed worldview was admirable, and the movies surprises hadn't yet been revealed.So as the movie rolled, and I got too see one of the worst, most painful movies I have ever seen, I could honestly say it wasn't me. I enjoy scifi and Hong Kong films, enjoy Philip K. Dick, so I was basically the ideal audience for this film.The plot was so full of loopholes, maintaining suspension of disbelief was impossible. Except for one or two supporting cast members, the acting was lifeless, and the action was unsupported by any motivation. The antagonists were far more sympathetic than the protagonists, whose cold-blooded killing sprees did nothing to endear them to me. Finally the washed out lighting and coloring took away a lot of depth from the images.. when someone seems to leap from building to building, if the buildings look collapsed together, it's not that impressive.And the fighting.. when you watch Jet Li or Jackie Chan fight, even when they are obviously assisted by wires, you feel an exhilaration at what they are physically capable of doing. The fights flow, and the character is maintained through out. In The Matirx, there is no real joy or sense of exertion. People punch each other, pull some interesting feats, but without any sense of risk or accomplishment.What people saw in this waste of film, time and money, I do not know. But I include it with the American remake of Godzilla as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. If you want Phillip K. Dick reality warping, see Blade Runner. If you want good cyberpunk anime, see Akira or Ghost in The Shell, or for martial arts, a good Bruce Lee or Hong Kong flick.But don't waste your time on this."
tt0372784,"Wow, can you say ""boring"" any louder? I am a Batman fan, but this movie was just ridiculously boring. i mean seriously, it actually starts out with a little boy stealing a small rock from a little girl, and then he falls down a hole. talk about your exciting film openings. ah well, anyways, years later, he is Bruce Wayne, the only white man in an English-language Chinese prison. Bruce is pretty rich back in America, but he had himself sent to a Chinese prison so that he could train himself to beat people up, because he's peaved about his parents getting shot by a lame mugger. Okay. Then, he meets a guy with some sort of unpronounceable name, and this guy wants Bruce to join his group of evil ninjas. So, Bruce is like, ""Evil ninjas? Where do I sign up?"" Of course, when the evil ninja training is finished (wich totally sucked) and they want him to kill somebody, Bruce freaks out and burns down the whole place, probably killing quite a few people, very not Batman like since he vowed not to ""kill"" anyone(though Michael Keaton's wasn't a complete wimp like bale is here). Okay. Then, he goes home to rejoin the business world and fight crime. Luckily, he meets a guy at his father's company, and this guy makes superhero equipment for a living. Talk about your happy coincidences.David Goyer must be stopped. Seriously. I have no idea how anybody could have looked at the script for this ****ing abomination and said, ""Hey, I want to make that!"" How many lame-brained action movie clich√©s can you fit into one film? How much cringe-worthy cheesy dialog can you make your overqualified cast choke out? How much cheesy sentimental bullshit can you squeeze into a movie about a guy fighting crime in a modified s&m outfit? If you're David Goyer, the possibilities are endless.I cannot believe the ratings this film has received. It is a good example of what happened in ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". Long story short, two con men convince everyone that they've made luxury clothes for a king when in reality, they have made nothing. According to them, only those worthy enough can see the clothes. Everyone fakes that they can see them, including a very naked king, so that they can feel worthy.My God, this fable fits ""Batman Begins"" perfectly. It is an overblown, poorly written, stiffly acted, and badly photographed film. The action is completely ""been there done that"" and is photographed WAY too up close, like many bad action movies of late. Christian Bale has a monotone voice and has NO EXPRESSION! Not ever. He frankly looks bored most of the time. That really bugged me. And yes, his voice as Batman was just plain embarrassing. It felt like an SNL skit of Batman.I truly think that the marketing of this film was solely based on the idea that ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin"" sucked. They weren't good, but lets remember, they each made a good amount of money for so films so critically drubbed. But they made money because people were entertained, even if they are too chicken to admit it. But Nolan gets to show us that they were stupid and frivolous movies and that he's going to blow them out of the water by being adult and intelligent. Audiences don't want to feel stupid, they LIKE feeling smart, thus with open arms people have accepted ""Batman Begins"" because they are told it is dark and unlike any other. But people truly are making more of ""Batman Begins"" than it is.It strives so hard to be realistic and profound that it strips the energy and excitement form Batman. People talk in heavy handed riddles and the dialog is leaden and pretentious. And the plot is at times damn confusing. Characters appear and disappear, only to change motivations or create new motivations altogether. Blue flowers and weird organizations come about hoping the audience can fill in an explanation, and some Asian guy...has seemingly no purpose whatsoever, but appears in the film long enough so that one thinks hes there for a reason. Also, the montage of Batman training was very scatter shot. What did they show? Really...I think they just quickly edited a few hundred frames of nothing. The Pre-batman stuff, you know, the ""Begins"" part of the film, wasn't very strong at all.In the end, I didn't care for anyone, because no one was developed! You can talk about fear all you want, but fear is not a character trait, nor is revenge, and Bruce had seemingly no character beyond this. Maybe its Bale's fault, as he was stiff as a corpse, but Bruce never felt real.This is so far a very harsh review, so why would I even give the film a 4/10, when thus far it seems closer to a 2/10 from my perspective? Out of respect to Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkonson. By casting respected, award-winning actors in small parts, some which are truly perfunctory, each man is only given a few moments to strut their stuff. I cherished those moments because even in a bad movie, these guys can act. But really, Gary Oldman in a small role as a humble cop who - basically does nothing?? Come on! Overall though, this is a huge letdown. People cite the darkness, and the depth of the characters, but the film is as deep as cardboard. You need not look farther than Bruce's relationship to Katie Holmes' character to see that this film is truly just a shallow hackneyed popcorn movie with a serious identity crisis, and really good marketing. If you want to see a REAL Batman movie that is not boring and actually takes risks and is original, see the aforementioned first 2 batman films BATMAN and Batman Returns. Thank you for reading."
tt0068646,I saw this movie when it first came out in the movie theaters.  It was the first movie I seriously considered walking out of.  Up to that point in my life I had never fidgeted so much in a movie.  I blame the director - his pacing was so ponderous that the story seemed to go on and on and I could hardly wait for it to be over. The whole Godfather series is vastly overrated.
tt0111161,"This is a good movie but it is far from being the best movie I have ever seen. The plot is ok but with many plot holes that I don't find really convincing. What do I mean by that? Well, the way that Andy dig the tunnel from his prison cell for years and that nobody noticed because it was behind a simple pretty girl poster.This movie is probably among the first movies about life in prison like this but these scenes are now so cliche (prison rape, creepy guy approach in shower, corrupt officers, etc.) and to me they are so predictable. I like movies to be unpredictable but with this one I guessed everything that was about to happen.It's just so unconvincing that he is able to run like that and to even be accompanied by Red later (like no one would follow Red to see if he takes them to Andy)."
tt1345836,I sat down last night on New Years Eve replacing the festivities with a big blockbuster that I was looking forward to watching. One word to describe it is disappointing. It just does not reach the heights of the second film and the main reason for that is the villain. This is not the fault of the 3rd film really as Heath Ledger was just fantastic in the 2nd film. It is that Bane is just so one dimensional in comparison and that is not down to Tom Hardy in any way. There just needed to be more mystique and terror around him but he was just a big lump with a fairly incoherent and gruff voice. And Catwoman? Sorry but Anne Hathaway is just not good enough to play this role and her turn to be at Wayne's side at the end-preposterous. And Blake to be Robin was telegraphed from the moment he came on the screen. AND all the police force to get caught down the sewers-ppllleeaasse no. BUT it was worth 8 out of 10 as it was a spectacular blockbuster let down by a little weakness in the plot and one dimensional characterisation.
tt1130884,"I just can't understand how this movie have such a score. I'm no critic, I'm a casual movie watcher, enjoying movies in general, a regular watcher.I didn't like the movie. Boring from the beginning to the middle, when things go wrong, then you ""learn"" the truth. When he begins to believe it, I though there would be some kind of turnover, that he would not actually be a patient and that they were just really great liars, but no, everything is just ending like that.Some people just left the theatre in the middle of the movie, others were laughing (when it was not supposed to be funny), didn't hear any positive comments on the way out... I went there with 4 other people, we all though it wasn't good (the first word coming to mouth was ""weird"")...Anyway, this is not a movie I would recommend, judging from the reviews, I guess it's either love or hate."
tt0816692,"Amongst the best movies of all time. The story, the acting, the script, the cinematography, the effects, the sound and the production as a whole is all absolute 10/10's.But what beats all of that is Hans Zimmers compositions. How he continues to churn out perfection to the senses is mindblowing."
tt1853728,You may want to wear a shield for this film cause it is bloody as hell. Like other Tarantino movies it is a guilty pleasure.
tt1853728,"A few of the characters in this film can clearly be seen calling the slave portrayed by Kerry Washington (Brunhilde) ""Broom Hilda"".That's just freaking annoying. Broom Hilda is from a American comic strip in modern days. NO ONE from back then would ever accidentally call Kerry Washington's character ""Broom Hilda"".Other than that HUGE irritation... I thought this film was well worth watching. I've never seen Jamie Foxx do such a great job (nor Don Johnson, for that matter).I was emotionally affected (meaning, I sobbed) by scenes depicting the cruelty dealt toward slaves in this era (and make no mistake, there are STILL people being treated like this throughout the world).Emotionally moving film. Made me cry, as mentioned. Just wish they would have gotten that ONE thing right with respect to the woman's name and I wouldn't have then thought, ""I'm watching a movie where actors screw things up!"""
tt0701096,"Bart starts designing T-shirts that go down very well in this funny episode of the show from the 16th series.What's great about the show at this point is that it has such depth in terms of the supporting characters, that Apu or Flanders can pop up, as they both do here, have a big joke, and then not be in the rest of the episode.I liked also that Homer wasn't a complete idiot, and that there was a nice heartfelt moment between him and Bart at the end.Another decent episode."
tt0110912,So the man in the suit is dead? What happened? I saw the bald man shoot him into the room but then later he was alive? I thought the part with the black guy was funny!! Why did they shoot those guys in the room? The girl was very pretty but then she bled from her nose!!! That scared me but then she did not die. The guy with the mustache was cool but I didn't know where he came from. I think it would be better if they explained it better. I got confused when the bald man got in the taxi. Where did the girl with the hair come from. She was talking about bellies and I got confused. Overall a very confusing movie!!!
tt0109830,"There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. Those who dig Forrest Gump, and those who don't. I don't. If ""Forrest Gump"" is truly viewed as some kind of inspirational cinematic experience, then America is in a lot of trouble. Forrest Gump is no masterpiece of cinema, not even by a long-shot. It is largely a formulated overly sentimental contrivance that simply plays too well into American saccharine tastes, mostly pop melodrama for the sake of pop melodrama. This was obviously made for the same audience that likes ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Lucky You"".Certainly, I don't have a problem with the idea of a feeble-minded main character from which to tell a story. (""Rain Man"", a similar idea, is a far superior story to and much more real than the silliness of ""Gump"".) I will concede Hanks' portrayal of Forrest is no less than brilliant, and he was deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1994. But was this film really deserving of Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Writing? Is this film really in the same league as ""Schindler's List"", ""Ghandhi"", ""The Hurt Locker"", and ""Platoon""? I don't think so.A contrived stooge, a late 20th century throw-back to Lenny of ""Of Mice and Men"" (""Tell me about the rabbits, George""), enmeshed in a series of sentimentalized vignettes is nothing more than contrived farce. Does Gump represent the American ideal or fictionalized empty-headed-ness? Forrest Gump only mirrors American's insatiable appetite for the overly sentimental. Instead of telling a true human story, such as ""Rain Man"", about the struggles of a man verging on feeble-mindedness, the filmmakers decided to sentimentalize him and put him into the most ridiculous and unbelievable of situations. Because of the fantastical nature of the entire story, I think ""Gump"" does a disservice to those with intellectual disabilities, although I will admit it does so inadvertently. ""Rain Man"" I think achieves quite the opposite.So many of the scenes in this movie made no sense. In the opening sequence when young Forrest's legs are in braces and, inspired by the ""girl next door"", he begins running down a Midwest dirt road, and his braces magically come off. Oh brother. Only Hollywood could imagine something that rings of a bad ""Saturday Evening Post"" illustration from the 1950's. Not even Norman Rockwell would have painted something quite so contrived. Of course the ""running theme"" will recur toward the end of the the film. Later, despite his feeble-mindedness, he's drafted into the army where he puts his rifle together faster and better than anyone in training. He's a feeble-minded genius. Maybe an idiot-savant?During the course of much of the film, Gump ends up involved in the most unlikely of situations. He plays football under a legendary college coach, goes to Vietnam, wins a congressional medal, meets John F Kennedy, becomes a ping-pong champion, meets John Lennon, informs on the Watergate burglars, and ends up investing his ping-pong winnings into the Apple Computer company. And then goes on a pointless ""run"" where all these people run after him. Or maybe this last part is realistic. Not about Forrest running but that people would follow. Obviously everybody followed Gump to the box office. And then to the Academy Awards. It's a wonder the filmmakers didn't have him take the next logical step and have him run for president. Raymond Babbitt (the autistic character from ""Rain Man"" played by Dustin Hoffman) could be his running mate.The only saving grace of the film is some of the Vietnam sequences, and his relationship with Lut. Dan played by Gary Sinese, who is the other standout talent of the film. Gump's tour of duty and his relationship with Dan were far more substantive than all the rest of the movie put together. I think it would have been far more interesting and insightful if the story was about a feeble-minded man forced to fight in Vietnam rather than adding all the other asinine episodes that made me say to myself, ""Oh come on..."" And I liked aspects of Gump's relationship with Dan, and I wished that had been more developed rather than Gump popping up in high spots of American history. When Gump reports the Watergate burglary, I just about lost my popcorn.The recurring theme of ""Gump"" is ""life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."". As I have never liked most of the candies in those boxes (I always end up with the slimy gooey ones), I guess I am not the right viewer to appreciate the wonders of ""Forrest Gump"". I typically avoid those boxes of candies just for that reason. I want something that has a little more meat to it, a little more realism, and a little more honesty. Not just gooey caramel. Whoever wrote Forrest Gump was eating a box of these candies and decided to make a movie about it. The problem with those box of chocolates is that you know exactly what you're going to get and that's why I avoid them."

tt0167260,"While not strictly related to the books, I must mention that earlier this year when I went to England one of my destinations was Oxford. While I Oxford I went and had a beer at Tolkien's pub, visited Tolkien's house (20 Northmoor Avenue, there is a plaque on the house that identifies it as his house) and paid a visit to his gravestone. Tolkien was a professor of English literature at Oxford and it shows in his writings. As mentioned previously, he borrowed as lot of ideas from the many books that he had read and incorporated it seamlessly into his epic.It is said that Tolkien hated Shakespeare and considered his writings unoriginal and contrived. One thing he points at is Macbeth where Macbeth is told that he cannot be killed by one of woman born. This meant that it was only McDuff, who was born by cesarean, that could kill him. This, Tolkien though, was rubbish, and wrote into The Lord of the Rings a concept that he thought was much better, that is that the Witchking of Agmar could not be killed by any man, and it was Eowyn, the daughter of Theodren, that ends up slaying him. Personally, I think this is just as contrived, but Tolkien's dispute with Shakespeare can be left for another day.As with the opening of the Two Towers we are introduced to Theodren, a king driven mad by the power of Saruman, in Return of the King we are introduced to another mad ruler, the Steward of Gondor. Gondor does not have a king, and has not had a king for a very long time. Instead the land is ruled by the Stewards, but there is an anticipation that a king will return and take the throne, and this is something that the Steward does not want happening. He has become corrupted by power, and the only way that he is able to let go is through death.In Lord of the Rings, power corrupts, and corruption leads to madness. We see this clearly with Gollum. He finds the ring and in finding the ring is immediately entrapped by its power. Bilbo has pity on Gollum, and in the end so do we. His life is corrupted by one desire and that is to possess 'his precious' the one ring. The ring dominates his entire life, and he ends up hiding in a dark cave staring at his precious. However when he loses it his life is destroyed. It is at this point that even we, the reader, pity him, because we know that his life has no meaning beyond possession of the ring. This drives him to then search for the ring, and this greed that has corrupted his heart pretty much makes him untrustworthy. The only reason he helps Frodo is to attempt to get back his precious.There is a point where Gollum appears to have beaten his demon, and truly understands Frodo as a friend, but this changes when Frodo is forced to betray Gollum, but what Gollum does not realise, and never realises, is that Frodo did this to save his life. However Gollum is an individual that is driven by one obsession and it is this obsession that drives him to separate Sam from Frodo. He knows that the only thing standing between him and his precious is Sam, and he does what he can to get rid of Sam. However, as mentioned previously, it is Sam's undying loyalty to Frodo that drives him, and even when Frodo sends him away, Sam always remains there, ready to step up and save his friend."
tt1375666,"I went into the cinema to see this film with sky high expectations given the domestic and international reviews of it. Phrases like ""modern classic"" and ""landmark film"" made me think that I was in for something truly special in terms of film history along the lines of Citizen Kane and The Godfather.Turns out I wasn't, well not all the way anyway. I won't bother with the whole plot line, since it's very sprawling and complicated, but suffice it to say that my main disappointment with the film stems from the fact that the thematics of the story simply are too limited and ordinary compared to the potential impact of the film's gimmick: the fact that you can enter somebody's dream to steal information or plant ideas.The plot revolves mainly around industrial espionage, a theme which simply does nothing for me emotionally. Who cares if one industrial tycoon wants to stop another? The dream concept of the film is truly magical and innovative and is a very compelling feature of the film itself. But why in heaven's name marry it to something as pointless as industrial espionage? What happened to something like the fight for world domination? It would have given the film infinitely more punch if the plot had centered around some political intrigue in stead. Especially given the unstable nature of the world today with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, huge climate issues, and so forth.The subplot involving Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard's characters to me comes off very flat, their on screen chemistry not being very strong. This is a shame, for the premise of the subplot has great emotional potential.All in all, somewhat of a disappointment, despite the wallop one inevitably receives from the film's take on the concept of entering someone else's dreams."
tt0114369,"Se7en is one of those films you watch in between long intervals. For me, this was my third rewatch and my last. I don't think I have the stomach for another.It is essentially a buddy cop flick, but the script touches on deeper issues of the future of human society, sin, apathy, and predestination. The Noir trappings are beautiful to behold, the constant rain, squalor, grimy city that feels like every dystopian metropolis combined into one. But it occasionally veers into fantasy with a plot that relies on a few too many gimmicks to make it flawless. The villain is simply an omnipotent being at times with almost magic powers.There are moments of genuine humanity that doesn't make it completely hopeless, but the atmosphere is filled with so much despair and nihilism that the grunge attitude of it does begin to wear as the clock ticks by. And by the time the villain of the piece makes his grand entry, I kept expecting him to appear with a leather mask on his face and gloating evilly about eating a census taker's liver with fava beans and a nice Chianti.Still, the dynamic between Freeman and Pitt is still enticing to watch, and the story works as a parable or even sadistic fable at a rudimentary level. But sometimes I wish the story hadn't been so manipulative and fixed just so that it could punish these characters and push them to insane lengths. I felt like character motivations and development were being engaged at the behest of the plot progression, so certain events begin to seem contrived just so it can reach the shocking conclusion. I assume the writer was trying to teach a lesson, albeit in a clumsy fashion.I would call it a minor 90s classic, and the dreamlike, twilight zone-esque environment adds a nice surreal atmosphere. For those willing to ignore plot conveniences and the dingy weather, this film will take you along for a horrific trip into the darkest recesses of what men are capable of."
tt0816692,"A couple years ago, there was a major motion picture called ""Cloud Atlas."" Never heard of it? That's because it bombed. It was a three-hour marathon of six non-intertwining stories, one of which held my interest. The least interesting depicted a futuristic world of cannibalism and idol-worship on the big island of Hawaii. I wrote at the time that Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are so bad in this story they seem like amateurs. The dialogue is stilted and ridiculous. I couldn't believe Warner Brothers had actually green-lighted this project.Now I've seen something similar. Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" is a three-hour convoluted mess of science fiction, with a potentially interesting story buried somewhere deep inside the dialogue. To wit, in the future, the world is approaching the end of its habitability. I don't know why. It has something to do with crop blight, but if the explanation was in the script, I must have missed it. NASA has developed a secret plan to explore other potentially viable planets. Impossible, you say? Ah, but there is a ""wormhole"" near Saturn, which allows astronauts to explore five promising alternatives for the salvation of humanity. (A wormhole is a theoretical means of quickly traveling through space and time, based on Einstein's theory of relativity. Think of it like Han Solo traveling at warp speed, only it's supposed to sound more plausible.) I'm not sure anyone ever explained why all five planets were able to appear in the same place at the same time, when in reality, they must have been light-years apart from one another.The always-reliable Matthew McConaughey plays NASA pilot Cooper, and Anne Hathaway is Amelia, a scientist also aboard the rocket ship. In the best decision writers Jonathan and Christopher Nolan made, no romance is ever suggested between the two leads. I only wish they had done a better job of explaining what ""Interstellar"" is all about.After landing on one of the planets, Cooper and Amelia meet up with another scientist, Dr. Mann, played by Matt Damon, who was stranded on a previous mission. In the strangest plot twist, Dr. Mann tries to kill Cooper for some unexplained reason. Up until this point, I believed I could suspend my disbelief enough to recommend ""Interstellar."" But why wouldn't two NASA employs be able to work together? Is it because Nolan wanted Dr. Mann's shuttle to explode while attempting to dock with the rocket? Could be. Unlike last year's excellent ""Gravity,"" ""Interstellar"" is a loud, busy picture, overstuffed with special effects, unnecessary music, and screaming characters.Eventually, Cooper and Amelia venture into a black hole (yes, on purpose; don't ask why) where time appears spatially, allowing Cooper to visit his daughter in her childhood and warn her to lead humanity to explore other worlds. Ironically, we see this warning at the beginning of the film, before the voyage even begins. It doesn't make sense then, but for my money, it never makes sense at the end of the picture either. Somehow, Cooper doesn't age, yet his young daughter appears as an old woman at the end. Again, it has something to do with Einstein's Theory of Relativity ‚Äì and therein lay the problem: Nobody understands the Theory of Relativity! All the longwinded scientific explanation of the cast (which eats up most of the dialogue) sounds like a bunch of existential mubmo-jumbo from the original ""Star Trek"" series. It's impossible to follow, due to its complexity, yet it's impossible to suspend disbelief, because the plot is so outlandish.Coming on the heels of Alfonso Cuaron's far superior ""Gravity"" last year, ""Interstellar"" pales in comparison. Much as Stanley Kubrick did in ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" Cuaron managed to nail the silence of outer space. ""Gravity"" was a quiet, reserved film, which highlighted the loneliness of space travel. ""Interstellar"" is blaring and assiduous ‚Äì like a semi-serious ""Star Wars"" crossed with the garbage science of ""Star Trek."" ""Interstellar"" is an old-fashioned Saturday matin√©e, revved up past power ten with top-notch actors, IMAX special effects, and a music score that just won't stop. ""Interstellar"" is so big and expensive, it was financed by both Paramount and Warner Brothers. It's movie-making on a grand scale. And at that level, it fails. It might have worked, had it simply been stripped down a notch or two.And it's probably just me, but I have a problem with the name. Why would anyone choose an adjective as the name of a movie? Interstellar what? Where's the evasive noun? Probably sitting on the cutting-room floor with Einstein's Theory of Relativity."
tt0816692,"'Memento' and 'Inception' had some problems, but their ideas stretched the imagination. 'Interstellar' only delivers the bombastic silliness one would expect if a puffed-up Batman director thought he could eclipse Kubrick's '2001' with a puerile adventure story. Christopher Nolan's new film begins badly and steadily declines as its long-winded prologue introduces the stereotypical elements of a Steven Spielberg/Norman Rockwell Sci-Fi co-production - a widowed ex-astronaut farmer, his chiseled jaw, a feisty daughter, a crusty grandpa, a dying Earth, dust storms, paranormal activity, baseball, cornfields - and lots of corn.After about an hour - which seems like two - a valiant crew lifts off in search of a planet to save humanity. Once they've journeyed through an intergalactic wormhole, the implausibility dimension expands to cosmic levels. Scientific hocus-pocus is stirred into the sentimental sludge as gigantic tsunamis, deranged astronauts, spaceship chases, time travel tomfoolery and black hole baloney eventually lead to a schmaltzy Hallmark-style climax. The visual effects are above average, but far short of awesome. When all is said and done, the film's self-importance and mawkishness leave one rooting for humanity's extinction."
tt0114369,"(Some SPOILERS!) Here you get to see the most moronic individual ever to wear a detective's badge (well played by Brad Pitt, but it may come naturally to him) team up with the standard wise, fatherly old cop (Freeman) to trade cop talk lifted from some TV series for about an hour and a half. Interspersed with this insipid dialogue are (1) some gross scenes which are meant to be shocking; and (2) random scenes featuring Gwyneth Paltrow which have absolutely nothing to do with what passes for a plot up to that point, making it pretty clear that either (a) something's gonna happen to her in the end; (b) the script was written by a moron; or (c) both of the above. Nothing of any interest at all happens until Kevin Spacey finally shows up, but even he has trouble making anything out of this silly, predictable wanna-be thriller. While I'm at listing things, here are the top two most annoying things about this movie (apart from Brad Pitt's non-character): (1) almost every outdoor scene features pouring rain (how utterly noir!); (2) almost every indoor scene takes place in an apartment which for some inexplicable reason has no lights, or whose occupants use exclusively 5-watt lightbulbs (so noir, it hurts)."
tt1375666,"I like Christopher Nolan. He a good director. His little movie here, Inception, is one of those movies that give you brain burn. Allow me to explain!A rag tag team of handsome thieves invade people's dreams and extract memories. But for some reason implanting ideas in someone's head is super hard? No it's not! Hypnotist do it all the time. Then this Arthur character says ""The dreamer can always remember the genesis of the idea. True inspiration is impossible to fake."" Also, not true. People get source amnesia all the time. I'm sure you've met someone who claims to have invented a joke or a phrase that they actually heard from someone else.And these thieves are trying to get some wealthy hot-shot to shut down his bidnass? There's an easier way to do that that doesn't involve dream invasion. Wallstreet does it all the time. If some butt-wipe is getting too powerful, just bust him for any number of egregious crimes in which super wealthy billionaires inevitably get themselves involved. Or frame him and arrange some kind of take-over. 10000000000 times easier.Additionally, there are plenty of cheesy Hollywood shootouts where the bad guys can't aim, and cars function perfectly fine after being filled with bullet holes. You could say the cars still work cuz it's a dream, but then why do shot up people get totally screwed? I can overlook these ridiculous elements in a Jean Claude Van Damme movie by simply turning off my brain, but that's exactly where everything goes wrong in this movie.Ya see, if this was a comedy, everything in the story would work. But it isn't a comedy, is it, homies? heck no, son, it's a psychological thriller! So it's meant to stimulate your brain, but all the absurdities mentioned above ask you turn your brain off in order to enjoy it. So the constant turning on and off chafes your brain. Brain burn."
tt0108052,"Schindler`s List is an over 3 hour long drama in black/white. This in itself is more than enough to put off younger viewers from watching this film.  The movie is about Oskar Schindler who came to Poland as a business man, and ended up saving 1100 Jews from extermination. The fact that the movie is filmed in black and white is quite a masterstroke from Steven Spielberg.  This means that the movie looks like an old documentary, instead of a feature-film from Hollywood.  The movie is packed with emotions and shows who war brings out the cruelty in all people.  Being able to understand the German language, I was delighted to see that small-talk between the soldiers were in genuine German and not English. The scenes from the concentration-camps(KZ-LAGER)are really scary and nasty, but very realistic. Prepare yourself to watch the cruelties of the Nazis in a way that you won`t see in other feature-films, only in documentaries. 10/10"
tt0172495,"This right here? Undisputed King of the Modern Day Swords and Sandals genre. It just hits that perfect note of an epic without feeling contrived or over indulgent. Ridley Scott really did something masterful here because I think this film showed an exceptional deft touch in terms of balancing accuracy and legitimacy with the feel of the movie, that emotional resonance that can overwrite some nonsense.Crowe's understated, quiet performance is perfect for Maximus and Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus is just a reminder of how skilled that man is. It's a real Batman/Joker kind of vibe with the stoic hero and the crazy, sadist villain and Phoenix is able to put these layers in there that make Commodus feel so complex and deep. It's something we're missing from a lot of villains these days who are just ""I'm big and bad because... Because!"" Instead he manages to make this character both sniveling and pathetic but also terrifying!After all this praise, it's weird to say that I don't love this movie. It's good, great even but it never quite hit me right. I never mind watching it, but also never really feel like seeking it out. This just happened to be on and I didn't change the channel or stream and wound up watching it and you know what? It's great for that, because it's a good watch."
tt0120815,"My grandfather fought in WW2 somehow surviving D-Day. He was apart of Operation Neptune and stormed the beaches of Normandy. He told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day. Before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about. He loved watching war movies... not sure exactly why. Some about that soldier life never really leaves them I guess. He absolutely hated Pearl Harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who don't know what to do in the event of being attacked. He had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance. Soldiers don't take girlfriends on private plane rides. And they most definitely know how to swim. Maybe I'll give that movie a good ripping one day.But Saving Private Ryan was a respectable ""I can't watch this"" reaction. He said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like. He said it was too realistic. Whether or not the story is based on real or fiction, that intro was 100% realistic. I'm not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before. I watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather. A scene he was technically in. Which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really is.War is hell and this movie not only shows that while being an entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers are left behind with. My grandfather was not afraid of anything. I've seen this man walk into a cellar full of black widows to get firewood and not even shake them off. The only time he ever experienced fear was when he went to bed. His nightmares of his time during the war would haunt him in his sleep. This movie helped me understand why."
tt0167261,I was very disappointed. The movie was so boring I started to check my watch while watching. Even the new StarWars movies offer more suspense then this bad second part of the Ring-trilogy. Just boring! What's boring about part 2? Simply everything! The first Ring-Movie was exciting and it made me curious about part two. But after watching part two I decided not to watch part 3!
tt0068646,"I wasn't born when the movie came out, but grew up hearing how the older generations praise the film to be the greatest film ever made. And I agreed, it was deep, it was majestic. But it wasn't really as legendary as you'd expect, especially when we compare it with the movies we see nowadays. However, the movie was made in 1972 and there probably wasn't much choice back then."
tt0167260,"It was a very cool and inspiring movie, it was kind of long for my taste, maybe that's why I only gave it an 8 but I really felt close to the story from beginning to end, even though it was kind of long i still actually wanted more. I know that sounds a little contradictory but the movie just pulled me in and brought me to a place where I was actually sucked into the whole world of the lord of the rings and I felt what everyone was feeling and although it was long time seemed to move by fast and 3 hrs felt almost like 1 or 1 and a half which for my taste is kinda long or just pushing it, maybe that's why it was a little confusing for me time wise but overall I thought it was a solid movie. As far as the acting I thought it was good. No one really stood out on that front but maybe that's what they were going for so nobody really out shined another actor, it was a team effort at I admired that."
tt1375666,"Boring movie with no meaning and only a few fancy special effects. Special effects were not even all that good. Just a few slow motion anti-gravity scenes. Even the Matrix would have been boring without some kind of ""meaning of life"" stuff. You need more than star power to make a good movie. I kept thinking the movie would have intriguing thought provoking idea, but it was so predictable. It turned into a real snooze. The premise of the movie is not enough to carry the entire movie. Using dreams to influence behavior is a concept that has been used many times effectively. Such as SG-1 when the Harcesus teaches Daniel that power would corrupt him through a dream. But this movie has no uplifting message."
tt0108052,I appreciate that they were trying to keep it real bit even the happy ending was depressing.
tt0167260,"There's nothing deep or important going on here, so  a critique of this film is almost unnecessary. What passes for quality film making is nothing more than an overproduced, loud, stunning ""Imax"" experiment in eye-candy that masks, once again, a slowly moving, thin story line. Obviously, the members of SAG have dispensed with background checks on film editors. There's enough slow-motion footage here to circumnavigate the globe twice. Many people will be amazed by the neverending, in-your-face action sequences but for those who still pine to see the actors perform also, you'd better search elsewhere. It's like trying to read the Latin version of ""War And Peace"" while simultaneously being pulverized inside a blender. And if having way too many computerized fight scenes forced down your throat wasn't enough, just wait the full ninety hours for the saccharine-glazed, overlit endings. And there are at least 5 of them. For a while, I was expectin Obi Wan Kenobi's ghost to show up and smile goodbye. And Cate Blanchett never looked so vapid. It's brass, tacky, loud, long, obvious schlock and thus hugely popular. Beautiful looking rarely translates to quality in content and this is a prime example. Giving so many awards to this fillibuster is just a waste of gold-plating."
tt1375666,"INCEPTION The dialogue in this film is preoccupied with explaining what is happening, rather than being natural. This is very possibly due to the director feeling the concept of the film was too complicated for mere cinema goers to comprehend and instead of enhancing the film as a good flowing natural dialogue might it in fact has a tendency to spoil the film. It is also very repetitive, continually repeating the rules of inception, the inner workings of the dream construction. It becomes very annoying and I'm sure Inception holds the world record for saying the word 'dream' more times than any other.There is a concept in teaching, developed by the Americans which goes like this, tell the people what you are going to teach them, then teach it to them, then tell them what is was you just taught them. It seems the director has adopted this method of explaining to the audience, just in case they are too stupid to get it for themselves, what the film is about and what is happening.Di Caprio who in my opinion is a talented actor that often picks challenging roles was neither commanding nor outstanding. Partly due to the lack of any real structure to the film as the whole thing seemed too fluid and poured out in a tsunami of CGI. Additionally there is no kind of character development, something Di Caprio is generally masterful at, leaving the film feeling hollow and a waste of an otherwise talented cast. Something Hollywood studios will often do when trying to portray highly intelligent criminals (or evil masterminds) is cast British actors, and it is noticeable in Inception that director Christopher Nolan has not broken away from the stereotype.A previous reviewer wrote ""The stupid dialog is there, because Nolan did not know, how to push the plot forward in an integrated way"" and i totally agree.I've heard a lot about how Inception is the new Matrix and I must confess I have never watched Matrix, I did sit down and try, on three occasions to do so, but all three times i fell asleep out of sheer boredom. That is not sarcasm it is real. I know the Matrix story as it's so well known, whether or not Inception is the new Matrix i cannot say but I can confess it's a fairly redundant mediocre film with an over contrived plot strung together by clich√© action scenes. The plot concept is not so difficult to comprehend and seems to be hyped up for what it really is. The only real thought needed is that of the closing shot, (this is not a spoiler ).. does it tip or does it keep spinning? I smell a sequel.3/10"
tt0429078,"I was going to write an extensive review of this film. However after seeing it i've lost all my energy and shall save the long review for another day. As for now i can only say that this film is simply awful. The pacing and editing is extremely uneven and disjointed, the cinematography is uninteresting at best which is a complete shame as the locations seem to have a lot of potential, the story is slightly tacky (although i think that under a better director it could have gone somewhere. This is a shame because Tsui Hark is meant to be a capable director) and lastly the music is absolutely horrific. The music sounds like it was done on cheap keyboard and does not have any of the beauty, poetry or even thematic development as the music from crouching tiger, house of flying daggers, or even completely different films like gladiator or the last samurai. Anyway, i thought the fighting would have been a saving grace of the film, but sadly to say it looks cheap and uninvolved. You tend to switch off after a while due to the lack of flow. In fact the whole film lacks a sense of flow and continuity and some characters and plot elements seem really weird for the sake of it. I am a big fan of Tsui Hark, but i should have known better that after watching The Legend of Zu remake, he had completely lost it. I'm giving this film 2 points out of 10 instead of zero so that fan-boys of this film won't think i'm a completely harsh bugger."
tt0110912,"Rating: 5.9Gonna get obliterated for this rating but I felt like I wasted my time. I get this movie was unorthodox to the movies coming out at the time with its non-linear narrative, gratuitous violence, down-to-earth dialogue, and absurd collection of plot points in act two we went from a boxing match to a gay BDSM chamber run by racists. But these alone didn't make it worthwhile. There are various interpretations about what the message of the movie is whether it's about seeking redemption like with Butch saving Marcellas, Jules leaving crime, etc., but it's not really about the message it's just pulp fiction: some raunchy stuff happening on a whim because life is not a linear sensical narrative with consistent uplifting messages. I didn't find the dialogue funny and I found a lot of the scenes nonsensical like how Butch decides to casually stroll into his apartment with no disguise and make breakfast while being hunted, and conveniently Vincent leaves his gun out in the open. If I wanted to see something with the spontaneity and pointlessness of life I'd just go outside. For me, this was disappointing."
tt1375666,"I purchased this movie on bluray because it was on #6 so I purchased it for 200 Kr which is approximately 38$. I guess I expected a very entertaining movie. but then I began to watch it I was disappointed it was just too slow. I couldn't watch more than halve an hour. Next day I tried to watch it again and made it trough another have hour. I had payed money for it so I wanted to see it. third time I made it through the movie.the theme about dreaming is interesting enough,but they try to long to explain what was going on. Imho it was kind of self explained.I felt nothing for the characters.the plot doesn't get interesting or I didn't get the plot.there is no humour in the movie, they take themselfes to seriously."
tt0137523,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSLooking at the subject lines of many of the reviews, I see phrases like ""pure genius,"" ""brilliant,"" and ""a work of art.""  This movie is not brilliant, it is not a work of art, it is a train wreck, pure and simple! There were so many interesting ideas introduced in the beginning of this film, but somehow they fizzled along the way.  The idea of a group of men trying to fill the void left by consumer society was interesting.  Then, Project Mayhem, a cult-type operation where none of the members can think for themselves, which seems to contradict the theme set forward by the first hour of the movie.  The movie changes from an intelligent satire to your standard action/suspense flick, with a little psychological suspense and quirky romance thrown in for good measure, Tyler Durden spouting philosophy the whole way through.  This movie did have some very good cinemetography and editing, and it was very quirky and high in shock value, which seems to be enough to get most people to overlook its inherent flaws.  I can only hope that a few years down the road, people will be able to see this movie for what it truly is, a movie that could have been great, but somehow blew it."
tt0993846,"This was like watching a cheap soft porn flick. The drugs were glamorized as if they were harmless, like crack being smoked as if it had no more harm than a cigarette. The sex was like watching a cheap porn flick, with full frontal female nudity in several scenes and the sex scenes left little to the imagination. The only thing not shown in the sex scenes was penetration. But the sex, too, was careless sex, like whores who use condoms, unless you pay them more, which is what he claims to do and then another statements when he went nuts over a beautiful woman, that he does not care if he gets aids from her, he just wants sex with her. This movie was recklessly and carelessly done for the younger viewers."
tt0110912,"OK, so I just finished watching this flick and I found it to be upsetting. I am 20 years old and I heard so many good comments about Pulp Fiction. I purchased it and thought I would love it because I like gangster and shoot-em-up movies, like Boondock Saints and Scarface. However, I do have a disliking of Quintin Tarantino, I hated the Kill Bills and I just don't like Quintin Tarantino as a person. I feel like the movie lacked motivation and moved slow until the last twenty minutes. There were several plot gaps that left me hanging and the twisting story line that was supposed to be theatrical was just stupid and unattached to any part of the movie. The only saving grace for this film was the fact that it had an all star cast. I'm sorry if you disagree and you all probably will but this movie JUST SUCKED!!!"

And being Stephen King, the setting is once again Maine, though you'll find 'Shawshank State Prison' in Ohio. It's the forbiddingly Gothic Mansfield Reformatory, 100 Reformatory Road, Mansfield, on US Route 30, about 80 miles southwest of Cleveland.Built between 1886 and 1910, the reformatory remained in operation until 1990 and was scheduled for demolition when the film was made. In fact, much of the prison yard has now gone to make room for the adjacent Richland Correctional Institution, but the striking Administration Building lives on as a tourist attraction. Find it just north of downtown Mansfield, off South Olivesburg Road."
tt1375666,"You only get to watch this for the first time once, so choose your state of mind carefully.
It is a film about movies and dreams and reality, and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter.
It is spectacular, and brutal, and enigmatic and disturbing.
It is beautiful and absorbing.
It is about one of my favourite characters ever to grace the screen.
I don't see it often, in case it's not as good as I like to remember it.
That is my secret, that I lock away in my safe in the basement.

tt1130884,"Forgetting the sucker I am for this kind of genre filmmaking I'm afraid I have to abstain from this one. Mr. Scorsese 's been trying too hard to make a grand, Oscar wining movie too long and now he's won it he seems plagued by his habit. The touch is officially lost. Blame it on the legend.Right or wrong a noirish crime psychodrama is heavily relied on its plot. To this writer, and I guess to anyone who's read his Edgar Allan Poe and seen his Angel Heart - the far superior movie ancestor of this one ‚Äì the plot is known in the first ten minutes. The rest, plot-wise, is an alarmingly unpleasant d√©j√† vu. Of course, this being a Scorsese picture, it ought to contain more than meets the eye. It does ‚Äì to a point at least. There is obsession, pain, guilt, and wrong turns taken. There is also the bombast of self-importance and meaning. Shutter Island (I'd hoped) wasn't the case for applying this kind of filmmaking mentality. Spectacularly, Island, besides being the patchwork of cinematic tributes to end all patchworks, also seeks for post post-modern auteuristic appraisal ‚Äì not to mention a voracious self-gratification/affirmation. Hitchcock, Fuller, Siegel ‚Äì all of them here imitated, none of them Oscar holder ‚Äì would never indulgeMr. Di Caprio, next only to his last year's performance in Revolutionary Road, is near perfect, the personification of the failing powers of a broken man. But, make no mistakes this a Scorsesian picture ‚Äì even more than Gangs of New York and Aviator were in their own egomaniacal way. Overindulgent and cinematically aware, this is a 138 minute thriller of the mind emulating genre cinema of the 40s-50s that was about 50 minutes briefer and decidedly more economical. It is beautifully shot and meticulously executed of course but all is so overtly stylized and unfortunately scripted to feel redundant at half time. Scorsese has never been a director of atmospheres in the manner of a Vidor, a Tourneur or a Wise and by attempting at exactly their kind of filmmaking ‚Äì which he admittedly adores and rightfully acknowledges ‚Äì fails considerably. His strength has always been addressing the fallen male and in that he manages a welcomely engaging finale ‚Äì albeit, a gloriously predictable one.An ill masterpiece for the scholars of the future ‚Äì who undoubtedly will contribute volumes of their own lives projected in the film ‚Äì a barely enjoyable miss to the rest."
tt0114369,"This is an outstanding movie. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are pitch-perfect, and Brad Pitt is solid. Pitt actually had a lot to do with this movie's success outside of his acting. He forced the studio to keep the original ending, and he forced them to shell out the money to get Spacey. It is fortunate that he did, as those two elements are central to the movie's greatness. Spacey played the killer so chillingly that it makes his message seem all the more unnerving and, perhaps, correct. The uncompromising ending leaves the viewer shocked and reeling. This movie could not have worked without it. Outside of those obvious elements, another key to the film is Freeman's character. His outlook on life is and how it is affected by the murders and by his new partner is a key subplot the film. It brings more weight to the picture. Also, David Fincher's dark, dreary direction adds to the film, somewhat similar to the way Ridley Scott's dark vision adds to Blade Runner. The constant rain is a nice touch, especially when it ironically recedes after the killer shows up. I was never a Nine Inch Nails fan, but their dark brand of music fits this film well, as evidenced in the opening credits. Overall, I think this is one of the great films of all time. Watch it if you can handle grisly images and if you like unnerving endings."
tt0508204,"Any regular viewer of the series will always be looking for the twist, and in this regard, the episode's plot follows one's earliest predictions. However, this doesn't detract from the oddly tense story. Top of the Class college buddy Dave, now down-and out, visits rich friend Stanley who does shady deals. Stanley appears to mean well but really wants to humiliate Dave. Our opinion of Stanley lowers as he treats his own wife like property. While the wife's emotions are on the surface, Dave doesn't show anything. Because of his blank look and the one-shots isolating the actors, what's unsaid comes across even more palpably, like watching a bomb tick. Deliciously tense. Unnecessary, though perhaps intentionally humorous, is the climactic patriotic music which signifies the act of betrayal here was justified rather than cowardly."
tt0068646,"Ten years ago when I watched this movie for the first time I had no knowledge of English and I was almost a kid. My first impression of the movie was that it was plain boring. I have just watched ""The Godfather"" again ten years later. I am about to be twenty-seven years-old and I am a professor of English as a second language in two universities of my country so I can no longer think that my impression of the movie is biased by my young age or my lack of understanding of English -oh, I also speak Italian by the way.This movie is simply way too overrated. I am not saying this is a bad movie but it does NOT deserve his current position as 2nd greatest movie of all times.If you have not watched this movie I invite you to do so and judge for yourself. If you have watched it already I would like for you to try and convince me that I am wrong. If you decide to do so, I would appreciate if you did it in a respectful way.Regards, MANIUIS."

Being respectful of each other did not say anything till we discussed the movie, which took about 2 seconds. Movie is hollow. There is no beginning, and most important, there is no END. Batman's voice was annoying. Heath was okay, especially with his disappearing trick. Oh yes, one person clapped at the end. I wanted to jump down and beat the hell out of him.

tt0167261,"Major deviations from the book. The sad thing is that most of them take plot out of the film instead of adding to it. There was no need for instance for poor Theoden to be mentally substituted by Saruman himself (does that mean Saruman could multitask?). A mere plot by his treacherous consultant, finally exposed by Gandalf would do (as in the book). What about this semi romantic and semi metaphysic scene with the elven woman? How does it stick to the plot and what's the relevance with book 2? Nor was it necessary for Gimli and Aragon to anihilate hundreds of orcs, just on their own. And where was that huron tree intervention to save the Helm's Deep? Frankly, I had this feeling I was watching a set of visually impressive video clips, due to the very loose plotline. And that can get tiresome after an hour. Especially since I was waiting for much more.In a nutshell, visual effects got better, film got worse (Gandalf looks much worse too).I wonder why second sequels are often worse. Let us hope third gets better."
tt0120815,"Saving private ryan.
We have looked into the lesson saving private ryan here is our review.
Direction: the direction was well done because, some scenes were also running and you also saw the action that occurs sometimes they had also filmed it underwater to really show the action that happenedScript: the script was very realistic because some characters spoke different languages, for example when Germans wanted to surrender, they didn't speak German but a different language.
The people who were in the war themselves had said in advance how it had gone and afterwards also looked and approved.Editing: the editing was very aggressive, they started filming death by scene, making it appear that it is very aggressive and the organs from the body and medical help also came to help and the body parts were also taken off and that very quicklySuit design: the suit design was very clear they were wearing a helmet to protect their head and you saw a scene when a person took off his helmet and was immediately shot at his head. you saw that it clearly looked real army clothing and not bad.Set design: the start was very realistic they sail to a beach where the Germans were with a base and they had blockages for the boats so that the opponent had to swim to the other side, everything looked very realistic.background music: sometimes no music so it still seemed serious.
and when it was music, it was the right music, for example the horns in the background it was emotional."
tt1130884,"I don't know where to start with how this movie was not just bad, but barely watchable.I'll start with the editing, which was atrocious. Discontinuity in shots that I hoped were for on purpose for plot reasons, but was never confirmed. Sometimes it was obvious that a shot wasn't done in one take - a hand on the left shoulder from one angle became a hand on a hip in another. But that's just for starters.The concept of the film was largely taken from an old silent film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (sp?), which is a far superior film. The other movies it seemed to steal from include a) The Wicker Man, b) Gothika, c) Identity, and d) from too many Hitchcock films to be named.Another big problem I had with this film was that it didn't let you become scared. It told you to be. There were too many scenes that didn't pan out and seemed like it was there for fear value. For example, the scene in the cemetery. They didn't find anybody there, but then again they didn't really look. All of the sudden the island was on the brink of a hurricane and they had to abandon the crypt they were forced to hide in. Nothing came of that scene and when the car pulls up to the gate apparently the weather isn't so bad or the guards are just highly undervalued as they're out and about and opening gates.Not worth watching in my opinion."
tt0816692,"""Interstellar"" is a beautifully crafted movie that explores the limits of human understanding and the boundless potential of the human spirit. The story follows a group of astronauts as they embark on a journey through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity.The movie is masterfully directed by Christopher Nolan, and features a talented cast of actors, including Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway. The score, composed by Hans Zimmer, perfectly complements the film's epic and emotional story.The movie's visual effects are breathtaking, and the production design is top-notch. The movie's use of special effects, particularly in its depiction of the vastness of space, is truly awe-inspiring.Overall, ""Interstellar"" is a must-see movie for fans of science fiction and anyone who appreciates a well-told, thought-provoking story. It's a movie that will leave you feeling inspired and moved, and will stay with you long after the credits have rolled."
tt0993846,"Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (2013) is nothing short of a modern cinematic masterpiece, deserving every bit of a perfect 10/10 stars. This film is a relentless, audacious, and electrifying rollercoaster ride that leaves an indelible mark on the world of cinema.Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a tour de force performance as Jordan Belfort, the charismatic yet morally bankrupt stockbroker whose rise and fall is the core of this exhilarating narrative. DiCaprio's portrayal is nothing short of mesmerizing; he immerses himself fully in the character, capturing every facet of Belfort's complex personality. His magnetic presence alone makes this film worth watching.The supporting cast is equally exceptional. Jonah Hill shines as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's unhinged partner in crime, providing a perfect counterbalance to DiCaprio's character. The chemistry between these two actors is palpable, and their on-screen interactions are electrifying. Margot Robbie is a revelation as Naomi Lapaglia, Belfort's seductive and fiery wife, bringing depth and complexity to her character.Scorsese's direction is nothing short of brilliant. He fearlessly dives into the dark and morally bankrupt world of Wall Street excess, portraying it with unflinching honesty and a wicked sense of humor. The film's pacing is relentless, and Scorsese's use of music, especially the iconic ""Gimme Shelter"" sequence, is a testament to his mastery of the craft.Terence Winter's screenplay is a work of art, seamlessly blending humor, drama, and social commentary. The dialogue crackles with wit and satire, and it keeps the audience engaged throughout the film's epic three-hour runtime.Visually, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is stunning, capturing the opulence and decadence of Belfort's world with breathtaking precision. The film's use of practical effects and seamless editing further enhances its visual appeal.What truly sets this film apart is its unapologetic exploration of greed, corruption, and excess. Scorsese holds a mirror to society's obsession with wealth and power, and he does so with razor-sharp wit and intelligence. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a scathing critique of the American Dream gone awry, and it doesn't pull any punches.In conclusion, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a cinematic tour de force that deserves every accolade it has received. It's a wild, exhilarating, and thought-provoking journey that showcases the best of filmmaking talent. With DiCaprio's unforgettable performance, Scorsese's masterful direction, and a screenplay that crackles with brilliance, this film stands as a testament to the power of cinema. If you haven't experienced it yet, do yourself a favor and watch this modern classic. It's a 10/10 star triumph that will leave you both exhilarated and contemplative."
tt0108052,"Schindler's list tells the story of Oskar Schindler (Neeson)who is a Nazi businessman who decides to open a factory that employs 'skilled' Jewish workers to make pots and pans (as well as other metal products). He then trades these goods and ends up making an awful lot of money. He employs Itzhak Stern (Kingsley)as his accountant and ultimately his 'right hand man'. Whilst he is clearly exploiting his workers, they don't mind as they would rather work for Schindler than be under the brutal regime of the SS. When Schindler's workforce are taken from him by the evil general Amon Goeth (Fiennes) and when he witnesses the horrors of how Goeth and his men are treating them, Schindler decides to take action and tries to save as many of those that are being persecuted as possible.If I was to judge this film on a technical basis only then it would get a 10 for me; the directing, the cinematography, the acting were all perfect in my book. I also liked that it was filmed in black and white as this helped to not only capture the 'bleakness' of the Holocaust, but it also helped in getting a feel for the era. I also liked how the era had been recaptured and created - it certainly had an authentic feel to it. Finally we come to the acting and for me it was Fiennes that shone as the evil General Amon Goeth - he was really creepy and absolutely personified evil. Neeson and Kingsley were great too, but for me Fiennes put on the best performance.So having said all that, you might be wondering why I'm only rating this 7/10? Well for me, it is technically perfect, but Schindler's list (at well over 3 hours long was far too long in my opinion). The first hour was brilliant and the last 30-45 minutes were also very good. It was the middle part of the film that dragged for me. I personally felt that 2 1/2 hours max would have been sufficient, but at 3 hours and 15 minutes it was just ridiculous.Having said that this is still a film that everyone should watch. It's not an easy watch at times, but it's still a very important film. As a side note, the end of the film is probably one of the most 'moving' and 'touching' moments I've ever experienced when watching a film. Great film - but a tad too long in my opinion."
tt0120815,"""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of Steven Spielberg's most haunting and visually stunning films. As the film opens, you see an elderly man (Whose identity is not revealed until the end), standing at a headstone, in tears. Why? You soon understand the story as we go back in time.It is D-Day, June 6th,1944. You are soon caught up in the battle on Omaha Beach. And it is INCREDIBLY bloody. Soldiers are shot, drowned, blown apart or on fire during the battle on the beach against the Germany army. One of the soldiers fighting is Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks, in one of his best performances), who fights bravely, but you can see the terror that engulfs him. His hands say it all: an uncontrollable shaking.Soon after the battle, Miller is given a mission: seems that 3 of the killed men were brothers. A fourth is behind enemies lines and needs to be rescued and sent home to America. With his team members accompanying him, Miller starts his search for Private Ryan (Matt Damon).This is not an easy mission. Every single man knows that they may not survive the trek through the countryside of Normandy. Pvt. Reiben (Edward Burns)believes that Pvt. Ryan is not worth saving, at the cost of their lives. But with courage and determination by the team (although some members do lose their lives), they find Ryan. However, Ryan refuses to leave because a bridge in a bomb shattered town needs protection from the German army. With the assistance of the surviving team, they take a stand against the army. It is at this point that the surviving team members understand the importance of a lingering question through the film: will their sacrifice make a difference? By taking a stand to defend the bridge, the answer is obvious: yes.The performances of the actors are powerful; Including Hanks, Burns and Damon, you have Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel and Jeremy Davies. John Williams, who always works well with Spielberg, provides a powerful score. The battle at the beginning of the film is one of the most heart wrenching scenes in cinematic history (And is not for the squeamish). It is a very moving film, and you will need plenty of tissue before you watch it."
tt0993846,"I'm sorry to say but for the first time, the critics were pretty spot on with this. The acting performances of both Leonardo DeCaprio and Jonah Hill were top notch and most definitely worthy of the accolades they have received, but the movie it self seemed like it was on massive quantities of drugs. It was a great story, but it was told in such a choppy manner, some of the scenes were so over the top I felt like I was watching another Tucker Maxx movie. I was really hoping for more. Great acting (Rob Reiner deserved an Oscar nomination too)...OK movie...and it was WAY too long!!! I don't know how he did it, but Scorsese managed to drag this out for almost 3 full hours. He couldn't do a 3 hour version of Goodfellas or The Departed, but managed to extend the life of this for 3 hours? Again, I was really hoping for more."
tt0133093,"The whole premise of THE MATRIX is flawed.  The machines are using humans as a power source - WHAT?  Yes, humans, and all animals, radiate heat, but they never radiate more energy than they consume.  Any physicist will tell you that it will take more energy to produce food and transport it to the humans than will ever be gotten from the humans.  The humans are an energy sink. It doesn't matter how high-tech the machines supposedly are.  You can't overcome the laws of thermodynamics."
tt0172495,"i avoided this film when it came out at the cinema, and when it won at the oscars i begrudgingly agreed to watch it on video.  ""gladiator"", although a technically well made movie, suffers from bad writing and average acting (although joaquin phoenix is good).  russell crowe is always a good actor, but even he seems weighed down by the action and special effects to be able to give an in-depth performance - i can't help but feel his oscar was more of a nod for his performance in ""the insider"" more than anything else.  i admit it would have been a good movie to see on the big screen, but even then there are some backdrops that look.. well, like backdrops.  overall, it was eyecandy trying to be something more, and out of the five nominees for best picture it was the weakest.liked the tigers though - why weren't they given"
tt0372784,"Forget all that colorful, candy coated, over-the-top, comic book style trash that poisoned the last two Batman movies. Joel Schumacher should be embarrassed for creating Batman Forever and Batman & Robin which became the ultimate low for the character since his creation in 1939. This new film thankfully has nothing in common with those embarrassments. Batman Begins is a prequel to everything we have seen before. It takes us back to young Bruce Wayne as a boy. The film has a very dark, gritty feel to it. In fact, I found it hearkening back to Tim Burton's unique style found in the original Batman movie with The Joker and Batman Returns with The Penguin and Catwoman. If you liked those then you will love this new one. I think it is even better.Without ruining it for those who haven't seen it the new Batman Begins shows the transformation that took place from young Bruce Wayne to Batman. It truly recaptures what the original story about Batman was meant to be. You witness the initial training, the beginning of the bat-cave, the early gadgets, and of course crime fighting at its finest. All of this is carefully executed to keep your attention and entertain you without overloading you with special effects and other Hollywood tricks. I dare say it may be the best Batman film ever made. Sequels are on the way of course."
tt0508216,"There are a few interest points here. One is that it is directed by the most prolific 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' director Robert Stevens, who did do some misfires (""The Hidden Thing"") but also some truly fine episodes. Two is that it starred some good talent such as Hurd Hatfield and Mildred Dunnock in the cast. Three is that there have been some inevitable comparisons to Season 1's ""The Perfect Murder"", which is agreed a better eisode, and can see why.""None are So Blind"" is worth watching enough for anybody on a 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' binge and for anybody that loves the master of suspense (count me as one of those people). Yet it falls rather short of its potential. It is not one of the worst episodes of Season 2 but also not one of the best, up to this point none of the five episodes of the season have bowled me over. Stevens did direct better and worse, this is somewhere in the middle for him, and there are better and worse episodes of the series.Am going to begin with the good. Hatfield is an elegant and later unnerving presence, which suited the role very well. Dunnock is in a role that plays to her strengths and she gives it plenty of grit. This is definitely a case of the cast being better than the episode. Hitchcock's bookending is intriguing and amusing as ever.Furthermore, ""None are So Blind"" is solidly made, the photography having some nice atmosphere, there is some assured if not distinguished direction from Stevens and ""Funeral March of a Marionette"" is never going to stop being memorable. There is some nice suspense in the middle when Hatfield's character darkens. The script intrigues.Having said all of that, ""None are So Blind"" is flawed. The story on the whole is pretty derivative, being too closely indebted to ""The Perfect Murder"" (except that episode was more realistic and suspenseful), occasionally silly and the suspense could have been more consistent.Did feel that the script is too talky and that the episode goes too far in making Hatfield's character as hard to like as possible (making the aunt being so easily manipulated hard to buy or see much appeal in him). Will agree that the episode is most let down by the truly silly and too gimmicky ending. Being memorable but not for the right reasons.In conclusion, acceptable but not exceptional. 6/10."
tt0102926,"This movie is about a woman called Clarice Starling, an agent from the FBI, that is looking for Buffalo Bill, a serial killer.I liked the movie, but i think that there were much different things compare with the book (which i read first), so maybe I was expected more.What i liked about the movie was the suspense, like in every minute I wanted to know what was going to happen next and I think that suspense is so important to attract people.I would give this movie six stars out of ten since I was expecting more about it.I would recommend this movie to the type of persons that like criminal and thriller ones. ü§ó"

tt0167260,"Frodo and Sam continue their desperate journey to destroy the ring, Gollum has his eyes very much on the prize, knowing they cannot possibly get past Sauron's army, Aragorn creates a diversion.Surely this is a contender for the greatest film of all time, I can think of nothing negative to say, it's everything you want in a movie and more. Action packed, intriguing, funny and several scenes that will pull a few years from your eyes.The greatest battle scenes of all time, they are as relentless as they are breathtaking, if you like action, this is the film for you.There isn't a single lull, at no point does it ever dip, it doesn't matter which character the focus is on, it captivates, that opening sequence with Gollum was off the scale, as was the final, epic battle.I will only watch the extended version, as I find Christopher Lee's absence in the theatrical cut unforgivable, I know it's about four hours long, but that doesn't matter, you lose all sense of time in the wonder and brilliance.McKellen, Mortensen, Wood, everyone associated, incredible.This film truly is one of the best ever made.10/10."
tt0468569,"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10."
tt0102926,"First problem: this could have been quite shocking and groundbreaking movie in the 1970's, not after the decade of splatter, gore, mad slashers and all kinds of overwhelming violence, the 80's. And of course especially not after the first film-version of the Thomas Harris' book ""Red Dragon"", aka ""Manhunter"" by Michael Mann, which intensity and credibility is in a whole different level. So there was nothing exceptional happening on the screen to me when I saw this even back in 1991, being of course much more dated now. Sure, the majority of moviegoers bought this whole, at least partly due to being the one serial killer- horror-movie that also women could understand and relate to through the main character.Second problem: I've had this little rule of my own how one can quickly define a director's talent while watching a film. I'll do it by close-ups, especially of the faces. The more close-ups the worse as they lose their effect. Martin Scorsese, Roman Polanski, Steven Spielberg, Sam Peckinpah, Stanley Kubrick... they all use them only temporarily, on the right occasion as they should be. Then there are these guys who cherish those facial close-ups in almost EVERY scene like Tony Scott or Renny Harlin, which is, annoyingly, Demme's way of depicting major confrontations in ""The Lambs"" too. When Hopkins' or Foster's face fill the screen, either delivering or receiving, there's nothing frightening or emotional to me. It's manipulative and ridiculous, destined to be followed by all kinds of mockery spoofs and rightly so. It's soap opera. In the last resort, and to make the problem worse, the interplay between characters just isn't that intelligent and challenging as everybody and his sister seems to think.Third problem: Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are widely regarded as one of the best actors in (movie) history. I don't agree. While they're no hams either I still find them to be on top only in the category of ""mannerism"". Which is a little odd because judging by many many interviews I've seen over the years they are clearly quite intelligent persons. Particularly in this movie, they're are SO self-conscious in every scene. They are not talking to each other, they are talking to that scary middle-aged lady in the aisles. And what really is so special in Jodie Foster's performance? She behaves all the time perfectly normally and logically (why in the first place someone even WANTS to see a 'vulnerable' woman as an FBI-agent is beyond me), so how come Lecter-Hopkins has that unusual interest in her? And being a true female police, she almost screws up busting that serial-killer by making wrong decisions in every turn in the climax... Many actions are too unbelievable compared to reaching for realism in many other levels.I don't mind that much about this movie's success in the box office and not even it's undeserved but ongoing status as sort of phenomenon, but those five main Academy Awards for only the third time in Hollywood history was incomprehensible. Even just considering ""serial killer""-depictions, this is somewhere 6th or 7th best in its genre on my list. But so that leaving you all ""Lambs""-lovers with more positive feelings I have to admit there is one good, clever and truly exciting scene after all: Lecter's escape. Glimmers among the rest of the garbage like a shiny kitchen knife...."
tt0372784,"First of all, I have to say that I enjoyed the previous Batman series, directed by Tim Burton for several and then by Joel Schumacher. As good as that series was, this start of a new series would fall flat if all it does was copy the last one.But this series (and it will be a series it seems) certainly has its differences. It was less fantasy based and more realistic. To be sure, Batman still does some pretty amazing things. But this time, at least some of it seems more believable. At the start, Batman even loses a few fights - at least as Bruce Wayne. And he even seems to have a few fears. And Gotham City, almost appears to be similar to a real city. This Batman is more realistic, somewhat similar to the Spiderman series that is also going on. In both cases, the audience knows that the hero is still human and actually has a chance of losing and is concerned about that.This realistic approach works, and works well. Not only did our group greatly enjoy the movie, but we are very much looking forward to the next ones in the series. The acting, casting and direction were well done. And of course the action was both creative and fun - as one might expect.The premiere that I went to see was not as crowded as one might expect. However, those people that were there stood up and applauded at the end of the movie. One seldom sees that."

tt0313792,"The dialogue in Woody Allen's 34th film is a fulfillment of obsessive-compulsive daring, a resistance against phobias and anxieties. His characters are dubious about their futures. Careers aren't going well, and romance works only through wishful thinking. In defense against hopelessness they talk and talk, and whereas Allen is a maestro of farcical repartee, it is an amusement to lend an ear.This ruthlessly cold-shouldered, misrepresented romantic comedy has both an elder confidant and a younger teller of the story, so one character gives notions about life and the other gives notions about him. The hero is Jason Biggs, a budding comedy writer whose path is going nowhere, and his mentor is Woody, an age-seasoned New Jersey school teacher whose path has gone nowhere. He hasn't quit knocking on wood, though he keeps the day job. They get together in Central Park for lengthy spiels, Woody doing most of the talking, Biggs gratified initially and then doubtful: If Woody knows so much, how come he's high and dry after all? Biggs was at one time blissfully and absolutely in love with a woman who presented no frustrations, which was perhaps the issue, because he left her for Christina Ricci, a woman who is comprised of frustrations. Ricci is an aspiring actress who appears to string Biggs along generally as a stooge for exhaustively extemporized episodes in which she asserts the ways his life must be degraded if he is to carry on savoring her companionship. He asks if she doesn't love him. ""Just because when you touch me I pull away?"" she even asks. In one scene, she professes a six-month reprieve of sex.Nonetheless, this neglected entertainment is not just a comedy about Biggs' affair of the heart, Ricci's confused betrayals and Woody's consultation. There's an obscure connotation. Woody has qualms, not all of them acknowledged, and takes his young prot√©g√© to a gun shop to buy him a weapon. Everyone needs a gun, he expounds, to feel free from harm, to protect themselves, and so on. Biggs is hugely hesitant, Amanda is horrified and Woody appears to be betraying merely the external part of his apprehensions.It's like DreamWorks had the distinction of a Woody Allen movie and they wrapped it for the American Pie mob, as if they'd been on the right track with how their preceding projects with Woody turned out profit-wise. Jason Biggs is one of the very least of the leads to play the ""Woody role,"" but this devalued effort eschews the typical drawbacks of comedies about sex and love among young people and gains impact from the supporting work by Stockard Channing and Danny DeVito. And Allen is matchless as the bundle of nerves who backs into every outcome, resisting and carping on the entanglements and inevitable letdowns certain to come. What a pleasure to take in keen people whose dialogue is like a sort of farcical a cappella."
tt0137523,"To me this film is great in the sense that it provokes me enough to see messages perhaps exceeding the original intent of both the author and the film maker. The irony is that the film in really serves as a strong critique against the two main characteristics that Tylor represents: anti-establishment and masculinity.To begin with, the movie was produced by one of the biggest media corporates in the world, cashing on the corporate hatred and self- hatred generated precisely by those corporates. The crowd who followed Tylor thinking that they are liberated from the capitalist treadmill are in fact merely shifting from one treadmill to another. Same as the fascist followers who felt empowered carrying out the orders, in the process of working for Tylor they are really being exploited and given a tiny share of the power and resources they gathered - exactly the same as working for a company. Will their lives really change after credit records are destroyed? We have seen how communist revolutions rose and fell. What is, then, the whole point of the movement? It is a project of the protagonist set out to find his own value, instead of being defined by others. It is a process that requires internal examination and self-awareness. The crowd he draws is used for his personal project; eventually he becomes aware of his other self, Tylor, examined his own actions and those of Tylor's, and finds peace again with himself.Another mockery the film makes is towards the concept of masculinity. I quickly noticed the crowd drawn by Tylor consists only males, and the character itself is the projection of perfect masculinity perceived by the society. In a civilised society where powerful positions no longer require physical strength, certain male members feel a great sense of insecurity ‚Äì exactly the members fight club attracts. Frustrated by their failure to gain influence in the establishment, they go to the gym and boxing clubs to regain confidence, or engage in reckless behaviours to show how daring they are. The film portrayed these people as flat in character and seemingly stupid. The only trait that sets Tylor apart from them is his intelligence. In fact, it was the intelligent part of him that woke him up from the corporate slavery, not the masculine part. Violence and sex are used as a tool to express power, but after the short-lived pleasure derived from the power trip, the ensuing wounds and pain are long-lasting. While Tylor dominated Marla in bed, the protagonist does not even feel the pleasure from sex. In the end, the feminine and powerless Marla saves the protagonist by reconnecting the conflicting parts of him and completes his self- searching journey.My mood was manipulated by the film the first time I saw it; the motivational speech about self-discovery and pursuit of passion sold me. But when I realised they were blindly targeting companies, I suddenly realised the stupidity of the ideology with which the crowd was bonded, and from that departure, I felt alienated from the protagonist and from the film and was able to see the bigger picture. From the interviews of the author and the director I did not see the same interpretation I had, however, I believe an art piece has its own life after its creation. From cinematographic perspective, this is a very well made film. Once again Fincher did an excellent job. I recommend this film."
tt0480025,"This 80s set drama reinforces Shane Meadow's reputation as an actor's director and one that thank god, is actually interested enough in his indigenous culture not to take a cheque from a Hollywood studio and waste his talent making American genre movies. Danny Boyle take note. Paul Anderson, stay where you are.This is a considered, exceptionally well acted story centred on a 12 year olds adoption by a gang of skinheads in the months after his Father's death in the Falklands. Initially it's all harmless enough, smashing sinks and wasting time. They listen to good music and smoke dope ¬ñ not a problem you may think, in fact I once worked for a man who essentially built a career on that. But things turn ugly when old gang member combo returns from prison, having had any vestige of racial tolerance buggered out of him. He's a proto-Nick Griffin, in the days before he opened an account with tie rack but with more visible tattoos, determined to fight the ""war"" against ethnic undesirables¬Öand no, that doesn't means Geordies (I had to check that too). The boy is drawn in by Combo's pitch, particularly the part about wasted solders liberating sheep in the Falklands, which strikes a simplistic note and before you can say ""wasted youth"" trouble ensues.The period is vividly recreated, though Meadows can't resist having the greatest hits of the day playing on the radio as people walk down the street, and a cast who weren't even sperm and ovum in the real 1983, are superb and have a great career ahead of them, or rather would, were there an independent domestic industry to speak of. Mind you, Shane should be working for a while at least.What impresses are the finely rendered details. Mass recruitment to the National Front is portrayed in relatively benign terms ¬ñ a cosseted meeting in a working men's club. There, then as now, a hatred of immigration and cultural diversity is rationalised as a rescue mission ¬ñ hauling Englishness back from its diluted and fractious state to something bound to a fictitious idyll represented by the likes of Churchill (who opposed all emancipating reforms throughout the first three decades of the 20th century and pioneered the use of chemical weapons and labour camps), war time working class solidarity and that kind of male sack contents. Then, again as now, the ringleaders pass themselves off as respectable patriots, suited and business like, trotting out the familiar mantra of welcoming the hard working immigrant but rejecting the rest ¬ñ ergo they're not racists at all. Obvious really! Having presented this pack of lies, Meadow's discredits it with equal verve. When combo storms into the hard working Pakistani shop owner's newsagent, threatens to kill him and steals his stock (because presumably working for it wasn't an option) there's little in the way of appreciation for the man's contribution to the economy. A simple ""thank you for the annual 2 billion pound surplus in 2007 money you and your fellow immigrants contribute, subsidising benefit dependent ex-cons like myself"" would have sufficed but no, its abuse a giant knife. As combo listens to Milk describe the simply pleasures of his family life ¬ñ a scene that's like watching someone sit on a bomb you know is about to explode, his decision to try and batter him to death in a jealous rage is a tacit acknowledgement of what actually lies at the heart of the future BNP's membership - simple envy and bitter resentment coupled with an idiots view of history.When Meadow's explores the personal motivations for this hate his characters and the film as a whole have an air of authenticity, built on universally excellent and naturalistic performances. It's the attempt to tie the characters to the wider political and social context that strikes a false note.Meadows locates the mutation of the skinhead movement from anarchist to racist by showing us footage of the Falkland's war and Thatcher. Combos been in prison for three and half years and it isn't a coincidence that his captivity dates from Thatcher's accession to government ¬ñ he's a symbolic globule of Thatcherite folly. Sending your armed forces to protect a hill and kill sheep Meadows suggests, proved a stark reminder of Britain's loss of status in the world and this, coupled with Maggie's systematic and ruthless destruction of the working class through mass employment and the atomising of society, which essentially ate like acid through traditional working class communities (which was always the point), was decisive in inflaming social tensions. This is a fair judgement of history but labouring the Falkland's as an inciting incident overstates its importance, when a more rigorous look at the domestic situation might have struck a stronger note. All of this suggests that while Meadow's is a vintage documenter of his own childhood experiences and has an gift for social realism, his credentials as a social historian are less secure.Mind you, this may be all a misreading. Perhaps Meadows is suggesting Roland Rat is responsible ¬ñ the morning TV menace featuring in the opening archive footage, and who'd bet against it?"
tt0102926,"The Silence of the Lambs is only the third movie to win all 5 major Oscars (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is another): Best Picture, Director, Actor (and Anthony Hopkins has some of the least screen time for a best actor winner), Actress, and Best Adapted Screenplay. It is the only horror film to ever win Best Picture, and it made all sorts of money-- staying on top of the box office for like 5 weeks and already having made back its budget in the first. So the data coming in would say that I would probably write a review on how good Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster were, and how this is such a landmark horror film that would rival The Shining as being the best ever. But I'm not going to. I believe this movie has been highly overrated, and if you allow me to explain, perhaps you'll end agreeing with me too.When you think about this movie, the first thing you think of is either fava beans or Hannibal the Cannibal. But the star is Jodie Foster... What's her character's name again? Clarence, Karen, Carly? You know what, doesn't really matter. We'll save Jodie Foster for later because Anthony Hopkins is really what this movie is known for. And there's a lot of good to indeed say. His looking right at the camera as his character is introduced, his improv mocking of Foster's accent, his unblinking eyes and famous lines. Oscar Winner? Sure. It's all there. My criticism will be discussed later when we talk about the director. What I will say, however, is that Ted Levine is vitally underappreciated as Buffalo Bill. First, I'm glad to see Teddy in a role that isn't a sheriff or cop. Buffalo Bill's luring of women and skinning his victims already made him a viable villain, but it's his dancing in front of the mirror that takes the crown and serves as the creepiest thing in the film.Okay, I can't hold back any longer. Gotta talk about how this movie suffers. Over the course of filming, I have no issue with the directing. It's not too special, but it's not bad; the camerawork is a different story. It's inconsistent, sloppy, and moves around too much. It tries creating a style that just doesn't work for the film. The exception is Dr. Lecter's scenes. Everything works there, but it seems like the film basically was built around what happened there. Which brings me to the actual story and the editing. We start with Jodie proving herself in the FBI and toughing it out as a female there. It's brief, and some exposition is quickly thrown in to establish her character because, after all, we have to hurry up and get to Hannibal. Which still doesn't seem totally logical. They go to one of the most dangerous and cunning psychiatrists to help catch the notorious Buffalo Bill, and they send an FBI agent who hasn't even graduated? That doesn't add up for me. Fast forward a scene or 2 and we get introduced to Buffalo Bill. It's a disturbing scene, but now we know who everyone is looking for. So the small amount of film dedicated to detective work really hardly serves any purpose because, after all, let's just get back to Hannibal. However smart the Hannibal scenes may be, they're also predictable. And the music really is more nonchalant than anything, and when you mix it all together, you get a film that really isn't all that scary. It's a cop story with a good, not great, female lead and an unremarkable story, so it all dwindles down to Hannibal. And he's truly a pretty great movie psycho, but surround him in a film that is surrounded around him, and the result is just eh.The climax has predictable moments, but it was leading up to the tense finish I was hoping for the entire film. And then the decisive moment happened and it was so lame. The redeeming part is how the movie ended because despite my criticism from before, I thoroughly enjoyed the ending. So there is that. But if you want an actually scary film with a cool, strong heroine, go watch Alien, Zero Dark Thirty, or just something else.

My mama always said Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get. Those must be comfortable shoes. I bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing. I wish I had shoes like that. My feet hurt . Mama always said there's an awful lot you can tell about a person by their shoes. Where they're going,where they've been. I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I think about it real hard I could remember my first pair of shoes.Mama said they'd take me anywhere . Gum She said they was my magic shoes. All right, Forrest, Open your eyes now Let's take a little walk around.How do those feel? His legs are strong, Mrs. Gum,as strong as I've ever seen.But his back's as crooked as a politician.But we're going to straighten him right up, aren't we, Forrest? Forrest! Now, when I was a baby,Mama named me after the great Civil War hero.General Nathan Bed ford Forrest. General Nathan Bed ford Forrest. She said we was related to him in some way.What he did was,he tarted up this club called the Clue Clue Klan.They'd all dress up in their robes and their bed sheets and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something.They'd even put bed sheets on their horses and ride around.And, anyway, that'show I got my name-- Forrest Gum.Mama said the Forrest part was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that, well,that just don't make no sense.This way. Hold on. Ugh! All right.What are y'all staring at? Haven't you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs before ? Don't ever let anybody tell you they're better than you, Forrest.If God intended everybody to be the same, he'd have given us all braces on our legs.Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them. We lived about a quarter mile off Route 17,about a half mile from the town of Green bow, Alabama.That's in the county of Green bow. Our house had been in Mama's family since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come across the ocean about a thousand years ago.Since it was just me and Mama and we had all these empty rooms,Mama decided to let those rooms out, mostly to people passing through, Like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, places like that.That'show me and Mama got money.Mama was a real smart lady. Remember what I told you, Forrest.You're no different than anybody else is. Did you hear what I said, Forrest? You're the same as everybody else. You are no different. Your boy's...different, Mrs. Gum.His I.Q is 75. Well, we're all different."
tt0816692,"A lot of mistaken pop science and poor attention to details makes this film a dumbing experience. Films based in history, biography and science need both the writers and viewers to do the hard work of reading the appropriate research so that we are bettered by the film experience. Director's/producers need to pay attention to detail for excellence. As follows: 1. Blight is usually strain or variety specific and is easily constrained by climate variability and solved easily with cross or genetic breeding. Source and type of blights was never explained probably because it just can't happen the way depicted. 2. Dust storms would be limited to a few limited environs and would soon hit bedrock. Besides, crop rotation and contouring should have solved that problem. 3. Drone was suppose to have been aloft for years using solar panels, but no solar panels visible. Propulsion was? 4. The pulp fiction fable of no Apollo/non-moon landing event is not taken seriously by anyone who is a middle school graduate. 5. McConaughey did his famous finger rubbing thinking prior to kicking a tire but what makes no sense is how kicking a tire makes a vehicle functional. 6. Movie relied on an excessive amount of loud tonal sound effects to create drama when writing and acting just not up to the task. 7. Communicating in barcode or Morse is not how any intelligent future beings would rely on. And, later the gravity‚Äìquantum equations coming from the future in Morse which doesn't have Calc encodings. Certainly not through watch hand movement. 8. Female role model in Hathaway was cast for smile/looks not for contributing anything believably intelligent. 9. Dad, Dr. Brand, also poorly cast only for accent and stereotyped science look. 10. Dropping bombs on starving people was presented as a solution ‚Äì that sounded really ridiculous. 11. Looking for new Earth in another Galaxy when your own offers millions of possibilities is like looking for new home on the other side of the planet when one just like it is next door. 12. The energy required to open or even enter a wormhole would be equivalent to the total of our Sun's output for a thousand years. Also, if you can place it next to Saturn then why not closer like next to Mars to make transporting humanity easier. 13. The wormhole as well as the blackhole would shed matter to subatomic particle size. Communicating through a wormhole. Whoever wrote that has no idea of the scale of problems. 14. Speaking of Mars it can be terraformed with a few H-bombs to release CO2 to warm the planet thus melting subsurface ice to give H20 thus oxygen. 15. Turning on and off hibernation is not like opening the fridge; too many opportunities to damage cells. 16. Underground centrifuge space station was constructed of massive concrete which has only compressive strength not tensile strength. 17. Centrifuge center had a Saturn type rocket (100m high) which when blasts off should destroy that whole complex. In reality a complex that large and built underground would bankrupt half the world. 18. Those quantum gravity equations would not fit on that small blackboard. And, why are they using a blackboard in a tech world capable of traveling easily through space? Surely they must have at least an iPad! 19. So, not explained was how love brought Cooper through multiple dimensions (possibly Universes) to the exact correct time & space that Murph happened to occupy. Probably because the writer couldn't. 20. TARS sounded military dumb and those legs are not designed for surviving uneven surfaces without damage, let alone running. 21. The film's ending of throwing papers, the Eureka and the anonymous kiss was typical Hollywoodish. 22. Ranger view of Earth did not show a devastated planet but normal cloud cover; normal water and land color. 23. Five dimensional space-time is decades old-hat. Seven, nine and for the past dozen years; eleven dimensions is now the most likely mathematical construct. Remember that's all this is - a construct. 24. The effort to push books off a shelf would either be equally the same in all dimensions or not possible so that extra effort shown was just dramatic invention. 25. The interweaving of 1990s cars and other old tech, such as lap tops, all simultaneous with space vehicles & stations not yet achievable for several more decades, didn't make sense - incongruous. 26. The alternate Earth being made habitable by altering some made-up chemistry between chlorine and ammonia and their relation to N2 didn't make planetary chemistry sense, especially since such a planet would be hundred thousand times more rare than the more abundant habitable planets; also most likely more than a -100 degrees below zero. Conclusion: So many holes in this film that only a worm would love."
tt0167261,"I truly wasn't impressed with the first one. This one was a little better. I stress - A little! Absolutely ridiculous story line with unbelievable characters. The main characters were by far eligible for the Razzie awards (For worst actors). The best part of this movie was the end battle and the New Zealand scenery. Thats it. Terrible dialogue and even worse premise to boot. Actually I must add that the virtual character Gollum/Sm√©agol was the best character in the entire movie. his schizophrenic personality always made you wonder if he would 'lose it' or not! He was amusing and actually should win the Grammy for best actor. Cause the others were so thin, weak and unimportant.what a terribly sad waste of time that 2.6 hours was. YAWN!"
tt0120815,"I know, I know: RYAN is supposed to be Spielberg's second SCHINDLER. But seriously: If you think about it, it's obviously not! Alright: The Omaha Beach scenes are really some of the most astonishing action sequences ever staged. However, the following story unfolds as a clich√©-ed plot like any war story. It reminded me even of the pilot to TOUR OF DUTY. Tom Hanks leads a small platoon through enemy lines to save the last of four brothers, three were already killed in action. On this mission, some of the G.I.s get killed. The rest start pondering if this trip - if the war - is worthwhile. So far so good. To show that this movie is a deep one, Spielberg pulls the joker of showing the enemy in a humane way: ""Steamboat Willy"", a German officer doomed to get shot, who turns out to be just another nice guy, but from the wrong side. They let him get away. But when they encounter him the second time, the G.I. translator - who never before has killed anybody - has of course to shoot him, just to show that all Germans were demons after all. Hypocrisy! And all the discussions whether the effort was worth it are silenced, when Ryan turns out to be the bestest American boy ever! It could've been a far better film if Ryan was a) dead already, b) a cowardish and unlikable character, c) black, or d) just not to be found. THEN all the thoughts about the reason of war would have led somewhere. Now they are just a fig leaf to cover up a standard B-wartime flick."
tt1345836,"There's a storm coming .....Years after being villified, Batman is encouraged once again to come Gotham's aid, as it's in the grip of a group of mercenaries run by the villainous Bane.First of all, you don't have to be a superhero fan to enjoy this great movie, it truly does have the most broad appeal, there's something here for everyone to enjoy. If you liked the two preceding films, I figure you'll love this one, I'm a fan of all three, this is my personal favourite.It's a long movie, but it flies by at a canter, no single frame is wasted, it moves by at a terrific pace, it has incredible action sequences, but the story is terrific.It's really interesting to see Batman coming in from a position where he's decided and feared, he's no longer accepted as Gotham's hero and saviour.Christian Bale is the perfect Batman, and he is matched every step of the way by Tom Hardy. Hardy is off the charts as Bane, the last time we saw the character was back in The Batman and Robin film, perhaps best forgotten, here though he's an iconic villain.I can't speak highly enough of Bale and Hardy, but this is also, I think the best of Anne Hathaway, she is excellent here.A decade on, and this film is still fabulous.10/10."
tt0372784,"This film has everything: the right director, the right cast, the right script. Everything but that spark of excitement, of comic-book madness that would actually make it all work. I've watched it through once, and tried repeatedly to watch it again. But each time, about five minutes is all I can stand before suddenly remembering why I disliked it.Tim Burton's Batman was goofy, ridiculous, revisionist. But Burton is a great director, and he made a great Batman movie. (Actually, 1.5 great movies.) Nolan is also a good director, but maybe he was being over-cautious here. This film takes no chances, pushes all the hot buttons, and fails miserably. Two hours of this and I begin to wonder why I've been a Batman fan for 40-odd years. Give me Adam West!Here are some of the things that I dislike about this film:* Spends endless time setting up the character, then uses him as a soulless puppet.* Burns down Wayne Mansion. (The Start Trek TNG movie syndrome: every movie, they just HAVE to destroy the Enterprise.)* Creates no chemistry between the hero and the girl...* ... played by the insufferable Katie Holmes.* Horrifically inappropriate casting of Michael Caine as Alfred.* Somehow pretends to be a ""darker"" Batman, with no actual darkness.* The Bat-SUV. (Leaps tall buildings... oops, wrong movie.)* Ludicrous plotting, but without Burton's panache.* Christian Bale's totally expressionless Bruce Wayne. (And he looks even less like the comic character than Michael Keaton did.)* Ras al Ghul. (Surely, THE most ludicrous and uninteresting Batman villain.)* Morgan Freeman.I could go on, but none of this is the point. Batman Begins is a movie that's much less than the sum of its (theoretically excellent) parts. In fact, it's a movie that's much worse than the sum of its faults."

tt0137523,"I was not going to watch this movie because the pre-views did not appeal to me and I am probably the only woman living who does NOT think that Brad Pitt is sexy.However, I have heard several people tell me what a good movie this is and more than half were women. So, it came on cable and I decided to watch it. At 2 hours, I turned it off and I was sorry that I waited that long. I kept hoping that it would get better.I understand the ""materialism is bad"" theme. I also understand the concept of Ed Norton's character having everything but feeling so lonely and depressed that he starts fight club with Brad Pitt in order to get attention and feel wanted.What I don't get is after starting the fight club, why start making bombs and blowing up buildings?So, the point that I get from this movie is that it is OK to start and/or join terrorists organizations because someone is unhappy, pathetic and generally miserable with their life.I guess that all the folks that found this movie appealing and humorous, did not have friends or love ones in the World Trade Towers or the Pentagon.Because, wasn't it a bunch of unhappy, miserable, materialist-hating people that bombed both of those places?The only thing that makes me depressed are movies like this."
tt0468569,"I guess I missed the warning on the label.""You must be at least this shallow to enjoy the film."" This movie had no depth, although it really, really wants you to think that it does.Michael Caine was very good in this film. So was Morgan Freeman.But everything else was just so hollow. Nothing to draw one into the characters.And then the utter repetitiveness of the whole film. The Joker is a bad guy. The message which was relayed in the opening scene was then repeated again, and again, and again, and...And yet through all of this, they couldn't manage to put forth a story that was interesting. Nothing at all. Just excuses for special effects.Not as bad as Spiderman 3, but a really, really overrated film. Heath Ledger acts crazy throughout the film, but in a very, very two dimensional way.Ironic that a movie featuring a character called the Joker failed to have any laughs in it whatsoever.The first re-invented film was good. Things happened for a reason. Things happened that were surprising. Editing occurred.I would rather watch Adam West's Batman, than this. Those stories eventually got to the point."

I'd never read the Tolkien books--maybe that would have helped, I dunno.  I do know that I found the plot hard to follow at times, and some of the dialog was hard to understand.  But what really bothered me most was how cliche-ridden the film was--characters giving each other meaningful looks out of a grade Z flick, characters whose good or evil qualities screamed out at you, music that was laughably heavy handed, etc. For me, there were only two strong points: the battle scenes gave an unusually good sense of what combat was like long ago, and the special effects were impressive, especially the computer-enhanced character of Smeagol."

I have a few German friends and they are not a bunch of drunks, idiots, sadistic killers as descripted in your sick joke of a movie.As a human being I am offended of this movie and others like it and think that the world should stand up against this kind of gratuitous violence and movies like this one should be thrown away to the trash can where they belong."
tt0468569,"The Dark Knight is an extraordinary mish-mash lacking logic and cohesion.Technically, the film is well made. That is, it looks and feels like a blockbuster, though a solid score is sorely lacking.On the plus side, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman add gravitas to an otherwise ordinary ensemble.And sadly, a fine actor will be remembered, not for the likes of moving and sensitive performances seen in Brokeback Mountain and Candy, but rather an excellent make-up job, an over-active tongue and a silly voice. As farewell performances rate, Heath Ledger's Joker sits alongside Peter Sellers' Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu Manchu.To remind yourself how super hero movies should be made, dust off your copy of Spiderman II (from which it borrows) or Superman The Movie (from which it should've borrowed)."
tt0594108,"... and this odd episode of Gunsmoke shows that was particularly true for one guy.John Larch plays Jim Cobbett, a pretty well liked 40ish homesteader with a nice spread living outside of Dodge. However, Hank Luz is spreading rumors that Cobbett killed his first wife - she disappeared without a trace - and now he is getting ready to marry a second time. Luz has a grudge against Cobbett because Cobbett legally claimed a piece of land with water on it before Luz could. Matt doesn't believe the rumors, and he and Chester attend the nuptials for Cobbett and the bride, who knew Jim back east and has, up to now, always lived back east.Shortly thereafter, Luz appears in Matt's office again, this time saying that the second Mrs. Cobbett has disappeared too. Matt does the wise thing - he tells Luz to stay away from Cobbett's place and mind his own business AND he decides to ride out to Jim's place and see exactly what is going on. When he gets there he finds a distraught and somewhat traumatized Cobbett with quite a tale to tell. What is that tale? Is it even true? Watch and find out.This episode deals in a very 50s sanitized TV kind of way with rape, how women often feel it is a fate worse than death, how men often feel responsible for the outcome of their marriages and the protection of their wives regardless of circumstances, and how Matt has to make a decision on Cobbett's character with absolutely nothing to go on but his own past observations and the reputation of the man's character. Definitely worth your time."
tt0120737,"I guess I just don't get the facination with this movie.  I found it to be far to long, goofy, and boring to stay awake.  I actually dozed off for a bit after struggling to stay awake for the middle hour.  I haven't fallen asleep during a movie since the Robin William's disaster 'Toys.'I was told before the movie that this was one of the greatest movies ever made.  The Academy Award nominations further prompted my belief that this movie would be exceptional.  I must have been expecting much more than I got. What I expected was to be drawn into this magical, legendary J.R.R. Tolkien universe for 3 plus hours.  I had heard of the great special effects, scenery, and characters.  I prepared myself to be amazed.What a dissapointment.  The characters, with the exception of Bilbo Baggins, were all one dimensional and boring.  I found myself unaffected when they were in peril, since I could care less if one of them were to get offed by an inept Ork.  The Orks were scary looking, but when you consider that there were probably 300 of them and they couldn't defeat the 9 in the fellowship, their bark is obviously worse than their bite.  They are as inept as a Star Wars Stormtrooper. The scenery did live up to the hype, but I think it is pretty bad when you consider the surroundings and not the story as the high point of the movie. Special effects?  Maybe I'm a spoiled 'Star Wars' junkie used to the Industrial Light and Magic standard that has been set.  I saw nothing special in the special effects but the fireworks at the beginning of the movie.While it may sound like I hated this movie, I didn't at all.  It was an entertaining film, but I expected much more.  I held this film to a very high standard based on the reviews and feedback from my peers.  I don't know how this film cracked the IMDB's top 10 let alone the top 250.  This wasn't even close to the best movie I've seen this month.  But I will end up with the DVD as my wife loved the film.  I will watch it when I need help falling asleep."

You can't keep going back to ANNIE HALL anymore. ANYTHING ELSE wasn't really ""bad"", but it wasn't anything great or even different. Certainly nothing new. Another New York relationship movie, only this time using young actors to (presumably) take the place of the now-aged Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. Sure, I'm glad to see Allen himself popping up throughout this thing every once in a while as a know-it-all loudmouth who is sometimes amusing, but yet he comes off as just pretty exhausted. I mean, what is the point of any of this in his new movies anymore? ** out of ****"
tt0361748,"I don't see what people are liking in this movie ??? First of all, there is very little Tarantino effect in this movie. Only the scenes with Hans give you some taste, but even those are most of the time out of context and don't lead to anything. Where are all the colorful Tarantino characters that we eagerly wait for them to speak so that we learn more about them? And then there is the fact that there is no story whatsoever, title says basterds, we hardly ever see on the screen. They didn't do anything at all. Take them out of the movie and the story could very well advance the exact same way!!! Where are all the turns and twists, surprises we used to see in Tarantino movies ? At least he could have given us a non-linear timeline thing...After all, very disappointing movie, given that it is a Tarantino movie. To me, its like he got this general idea in his head but couldn't fill in the blanks nicely and so ended up with this.I have a question to all the 8-10 star raters for this movie. Would you be watching this movie over and over again as most of us Tarantino fans watch J.Brown, R.Dogs, P.Fiction and Kill Bills ? I don't think so. I know I'm not going to watch this even for a second time..."
tt0109830,"Delicate and warm American theme. The different fates of Forrest Gump and Jenny are almost a mockery of the affirmative action movement in the 1960s, and Forrest Gump's burial of Jenny is also the burial of America's own history in the 1960s. The writing is beautiful, the editing is clever, the monologues are soulful, and Tom Hanks' acting is flawless, but the film's values are dubious. So divided."
tt1345836,"The most anticipated movie of the year has arrived, and I'm sorry to say, but at least for this moviegoer, it disappoints. The Dark Knight Rises is such an overly ambitious film that it tries to pack in way more than it can handle. I know I am in the minority here, but by the final hour of the movie all that I really felt was overkill.This is the capper in Christopher Nolan's trilogy which re-booted the franchise and did indeed make it more respected than it was after the last few Batman films of the 90's. This series has a much darker tone which I always preferred over the lighter fare of other superhero movies like the Spider-Man ones. The dark tone still works well here, but it's hindered by the blown-up storyline. Just as many people observed with Spider-Man 3, there's just too much going on here. It's not that the new characters of Bane and another Catwoman are what bring the film down; it's just that everything is so dragged out in scene after scene. In fact, the re-introduction of Catwoman was one of the things that worked best. I've never been much of a fan of Anne Hathaway, but her scenes were often the best ones. This is a much smarter and slicker Catwoman than we've ever seen before. And that's exactly what you should expect of a character of that name. Maybe a little more of her and less of some other characters would have served the movie well.Aside from a drawn-out plot about Batman (Christian Bale) being gone for 8 years and Bruce Wayne trying to get his alter-ego mojo back, it seems like the movie tries a little too hard to give ample screen time to all of the other actors as well. It wants to make sure that returning veterans like Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman are properly accounted for along with all the new guys played by Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Matthew Modine, and Anne Hathaway. This results in many unnecessary scenes in my opinion. There's also a little surprise about one of the characters at the end of the film, but it was something I had already figured out at the beginning. And while the primary villain Bane (played by Tom Hardy) is menacing in his physical appearance, it is a little odd that they chose to give him a voice that sounds like an old geezer from England.All in all, The Dark Knight Rises was just a bit of a letdown for me. It's not that the expectations were so high that they were hard to live up to, but I actually found this Batman film to be the worst in the trilogy. I have noticed that each one of them has a prolonged climax at the end, but this one seemed 3 times as long and I found myself zoning out while trying to stay interested. At 2 hours and 45 minutes, it really just became a movie loaded with a lot of filler. I mean Malcolm X was 35 minutes longer, yet didn't feel nearly as long as this. There's nothing wrong with a lengthy film as long as each of the scenes are interesting or important to the story. In this case, they were not."
tt0167261,"A great follow up on the 1rst movie with an epic war scene, but it also delves deeper into the plot of charcter development. and sometimes that really doesnt interest me. so it has a few higher highs, but a lot more lower lows that the 1rst movie.7/10: waves"
tt0429078,"i'm sorry, as a fan of Chinese cinema, this film as officially confirmed the sad state of the Chinese film industry. the movie was pathetic, the action was off balanced, the ""seven swords"" appear out of no where and all of a sudden 7 ugly peasants become super warriors who can flip from here to Mars.Seems the only films worth watching are made by Wong Kar Wai(which hardly anybody understands and appreciates, but i understand it, and i love it, and if you can't, go read a book) if i were you, stick with Korean Cinema, watch Oldboy, A Bittersweet Life, My Sassy Girl, 3-iron Jip, Marathon, Peppermint Candy, more to come, etc.,"
tt0102926,"This movie is so gorgeous. Its like an art project. The cinematography makes me wanna take my eyes out because after this movie, theres nothing else I can see that hits that level of beauty. Anthony Hopkins did an amazing job and so did Jodie Foster. But even the more minor roles are amazing like Kasi Lemmons as Ardelia Mapp. The plot is so thoughtfully put together. The characters are great, creepy, and like a painting. I cannot describe how well this movie is made when it comes to the creepiness. Or anything. This movie deserved all of the awards and I hope everyone will enjoy it as much as I."
tt0422272,"I was pleasantly - or should that be unpleasantly - surprised by this little movie. I rented it on DVD with low expectations and it sincerely unnerved me. Although I am a horror fan, I am not a fan of slasher pics or anything too gory; I much prefer the Japanese and Asian style horror where the atmosphere is oppressive and the terror creeps up on you until you jump out of your skin.Fragile managed to make me jump a mile out of my skin with the twisty ending which followed a careful and extremely effective build up. Calista Flockhart is very convincing as the nurse caring for the final few orphans in a remote hospital that is closing down. The isolation, scenery and atmosphere really do chill you to the bone, and the ignorance and stubbornness of the staff - who know that something or someone is hurting the children but choose not to believe - frustrated me completely and resulted in a lot of me shouting at the screen (good thing I watched this alone), which I consider a good sign; not many movies get me that involved.I would highly recommend this simple, effective, well-acted, creepy and unnerving film."
tt0468569,"Seriously, this movie is long, tedious and predictable, and in all honesty you cant be bothered what happens in the plot because the characters are so two dimensional.in fact, its been a few weeks since I watched this movie and for the life of me i cannot remember what happened in it...That perhaps tell you how good it was?Anyway, god knows what crack these people are smoking who have given it 8/10...IS THIS TEN LINES YET????Pope"

Throughout the movie i had a feeling that i was watching some stupid piece of propaganda how wonderful all super rich people are and how dumb are the rest of us.

tt1130884,"After the disappearance of one of the patients on Shutter Island, two Marshalls are assigned to the case and figure out what's going on. The only problem is that the people working there aren't really helping, and weird things start happening.Scorsese and my favourite genre? Instant win. The film is so masterfully crafted and well shot that it almost feels too good to be a part of this genre. Yet the script and theme fits perfectly. Yes, I knew the ending when they first showed the trailer ages ago, but that did not spoil the intrigue and suspense this film had. There were even a few surprises added on which was nice.Dicaprio is again, on his game. He pulls out crazy very well. It's not a spoiler that he goes a little crazy while investigating, it's all over the trailers. Added to the cast of characters if Mark Ruffalo, he does his best as the sidekick, Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow as eerie doctors , Elias Koteas in creepy make-up in one scene and a scene stealing Jackie Earle Haley.The film has it's Kubrick feel here and there, but it's Scorsese's stamp on it. It doesn't reach the heights of his previous efforts, but it's still better than 90% of the stuff that's out there. Scorsese knows this genre well enough to know where to pull the strings. The music is a key part in this and the restriction of jump scares shows that this is a well done film that wants to focus more on it's story, than to scare the audience.That being said, the film is not scary, but it does make you feel uneasy at times. When they go to Ward C, you can't help but feel the hair on your neck stand up as they search the halls.The twist is obvious, but the unravelling of everything is interesting enough to keep your attention. At times I did question myself, but in the end I knew I was right. Scorsese is able to chip away piece by piece the lead character's sanity to make the film work. Some people may feel cheated, others will like it. I found myself liking it, even if some of it is a bit out there.Shutter Island is one of the better films you'll probably see this year, it's no masterpiece and it tends to be a the long side of the running time, but it works."
tt1375666,"I had huge expectations for this film reading all its glowing reviews. And yet even before it started and the menu fired up, alarm bells were going off. Explosions left right and centre, great CGI.....all suggested a lack of substance. For the first 20 minutes, I couldn't believe just how bad this film was. Drop the viewer into a complete state of confusion to look good?.....except that this is always a risky strategy, one which a only few films have eloquently pulled off, the nearest comparable being The Matrix, which this most certainly isn't- although it tries so hard to be in terms of style and delivery. Yes the CGI and special effects are at times breathtaking. It's just such a shame that the storyline was utterly ridiculous, disjointed, confusing dispassionate and so very, very boring. Great effects DO NOT make for a great film necessarily. A note on casting. Like the film, this is truly awful....what on earth was Leonardo Di Caprio thinking?! My wife totally embraced the subject matter- she fell asleep and the only thing stopping me from dozing off was the desperate hope that that this film would improve. It didn't. Inception completely encapsulates all the worst in Hollywood. Utter rubbish."
tt0137523,"While this film successfully conveys an anti-capitalist message, it also touches on deeper issues such as masculinity, friendship, belonging and identity. While Edward Norton and Brad Pitt give life to unforgettable characters that impress the audience with their performances, Helena Bonham Carter also gives an impressive performance.Fight Club is a movie that makes viewers think and shakes, even if it is watched hundreds of times, it offers the opportunity to discover a new detail every time. This film, which has an important place in the history of cinema, is a masterpiece that pushes the boundaries and encourages the audience to push the limits of their imagination."
tt1853728,"*This review contains SPOILERS.*I normally read the plot summary on IMDb before I watch a movie despite my feeling that it may give away plot details. With this movie, it was the other way round. Here's why.A freed slave in mid 19th century Texas, with the help of a bounty hunter, sets out to rescue his wife who is a slave at a plantation in Mississippi. The story doesn't get to this part till about an hour. I even wondered at some point if there was an angle where Dr.Schultz was going to double-cross Django and sell him off to some white guy. The bounty-hunting part is essential to the story but cut to the chase already! I felt chained to my seat as the movie dragged on forever.Christopher Waltz does a good job, but Dr.Schultz was badly written. He comes across as trying too hard to be funny and cool and his elaborate dialogues get annoying at times but despite all that, you end up liking him.Leonardo DiCaprio does a convincing job as the arrogant, rich, gore- loving plantation owner. He has evolved to the point where he can ease into any kind of role on screen and it is refreshing to see him as Calvin Candy.Watch out for Samuel L. Jackson. He is so good as Stephen that he frightens you, annoys you and makes you want to hate him. He is the highlight of the movie. Jackson and DiCaprio complement each other very well.Kerry Washington has a small role but does a decent job and plays Broomhilda well.Finally, Jamie Foxx/Django. I still have not been able to separate the actor and the character from each other. He is in a trance for most of the movie and transiently comes out of it in between to say a few words and kill people. His portrayal of a man desperate to get to his wife is just not convincing. His acting needs a lot more polishing, but Tarantino is no help because Foxx's portrayal of Django made me wonder if he is so bad an actor or if Tarantino messed up his acting. Hence, I can't separate Foxx from Django.The chemistry between Django and Broomhilda is conspicuous by its total absence. Even the girl who shows Django around when he goes to find the Brittle brothers has a few lines with him. After putting us through 165 minutes of torture anyway, couldn't Tarantino have filmed one scene showing Django and Broomhilda together (before they get separated)? Instead, all we get to see is Django helping Broomhilda escape early on in the movie and then imagining her all over the place. Just one scene of them sharing screen space (instead of the useless KKK scene) would have done the trick. No wonder Calvin doesn't suspect anything between the two of them. There is no show of emotion from Django when Dr.Schultz is killed. He just says a random, unemotional goodbye later when he collects Broomhilda's papers. So much for the man who freed him and helped him find his wife.The action scenes are a little too violent, but it is an action flick, so I'll let that pass. The cinematography is very good, editing terrible and music a little too modern for the time in which the movie is set.This was a good story with huge potential, but the abysmal writing, direction and editing made it a dud for me. If not for good acting by Jackson, DiCaprio, Schultz and the likes, 'Django Unchained' would have fallen flat. Undoubtedly, they are the saving grace of the film. The only good thing for us was that we checked the running time ahead and bought popcorn. Rent it out on DVD, it's not worth the admission fee."
tt0816692,"To this day , many people still talk a lot about Christopher Nolan's ""Batman""-trilogy, but here is his newest work: ""Interstellar"". He gets help from Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway again and a couple more familiar faces. One year after Cuar√≥n with Gravity, he discovers the endless widths of space as well. The difference, however is that a large part of his movie, including the first 40 minutes or so completely, plays down on Planet Earth. However, it is also about survival in space, including two people instead of one though. Or you could probably say the whole human race and not one individual fate.This is like our generation's ""Armageddon"", only that it is much better and much more edge-of-the-seat. The lead character is played by Matthew McConaughey, whose career is still on a massive high after numerous critically lauded performances and an Academy Award win. ""Interstellar"" is much more than Sci-Fi though. I personally found the film was at its best when it touched more the emotional relationships of the characters. The water planet sequence was incredibly well done. And right afterward, when Cooper (McConaughey) sees how his beloved family has aged and become parents, it is truly moving as well. I had a lump in my throat just like I did when he meets his very old daughter at the end of the movie. The inclusions with the old people telling about the past seem a bit odd at first, but make sense towards the end as we find out who is speaking there really.Then, I also had a love-hate relationship with the Matt Damon parts. I found it pretty boring to be honest initially, but when we found out about his true intentions, it quickly turns into one of the best parts of the film. Nicely done. When Caine's character mentioned him with high praise early on, I felt there could be something fishy (like with Pixar's Up) there and yes it was. The ending of the movie with Hathaway's character completely alone out there made me think maybe there will be a sequel. Saving Private... ehh I mean Dr. Brand. Who knows? The time during which the whole film plays is also interesting. Somehow, the NASA lost a lot of their reputation and the moon landing is called fake in American school books. It is some point in the future. That much we know. David Oyelowo plays a small role here as one of the teachers. He has ""Selma"" in the race for an Academy Award nomination this year.The ending of the film was not among the best scenes in my opinion, but I still liked it. The whole ghost explanation about Cooper being actually the one giving the signs was pretty exciting. The effects are brilliant of course, but that does not really need be mentioned for Nolan movies. A given. Hans Zimmer did a good soundtrack and there is also some comic relief coming from McConaughey's charm (if you like that) and some droll robot creatures. Anyway, I found the film interesting enough that I found it a bit sad they did not get to visit the third planet (with Hathaway's character's lover), only the water planet and the ice planet. I'd have loved to see that. However, maybe that could be a nice inclusion for a sequel as well. The movie never dragged despite coming pretty close to the three-hour mark. It could have run for another hour and I probably would not have been bored. There really was hardly anything wrong with it. Affleck's character did not do too much for me. He wasn't particularly well-acted and the character felt just included as a simple man who quickly gave up on his dad in order to show the contrast compared to Chastain's character: the ambitious loving smart daughter with a true connection to Cooper. John Lithgow plays a small role too and is fun to watch as always.This is one of the movies I really recommend to watch, preferably on the big screen due to its sensational visual aspects. It's also good for a rewatch I believe, also to evaluate the characters' actions, especially Caine's for example. And the story of course. I believe, after one viewing, I am still far away from having understood everything that was going on, especially the scientific aspects. That however, does not hurt the viewing experience at all thanks to the film's great acting and emotional impact. If you are interested in space, you really have to see this too. It has distant planets, wormholes, black holes, spaceships and a lot more. Let me finish this review with two little snippets: First, the actress who played Murph as a child was the same that played Renesmee in the last two Twilight movies and, secondly, that fittingly Hathaway's character was called Amelia like the aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart. That can't be coincidence, can it? Especially with her last shot."

You may ask why that is, firstly Tim Robbins's performance was mediocre the only actor who really shined through was Morgan Freeman and that's just because of his charm. The directing was not interesting and the whole feeling from the movie is very hollywood like, you know not real."
tt0068646,"Honestly this movie is quite mid, its not bad but also not this ""best movie of all time ever"" that people say it is, my conclusion for that is that people just regurgitate what they've heard their nostalgic parents say to seem mature or intelligent.. The pacing in the movie itself is quite stagnant and unengaging after the first thirty or fourty minutes (and this movie goes on for 2 more hours)I have attempted to watch it on two separate occasions but didn't find anything particularly interesting or captivating in the plot. This is not the problem of the talented actors or cinematography, because those were alright."
tt0108052,"Oskar Schindler - a man who collaborated with the Germans at the beginning of World War II, was a private entrepreneur, and at the end of the war gave all his fortune in order to ransom the Jews and give them freedom. So Oskar Schindler saved about 1200 people.Schindler's list carries a very important message - to remain human under any circumstances, saving one life saves the whole world. Schindler is a great man who saved hundreds of Jews. And all the criticism is worth nothing compared to what he did.The film is excellent. Everything about it is excellent: the plot, the music, the cast. For those who haven't watched it yet, check it out."
tt0108052,"I watched this movie twice expecting a great movie as it always seen at the top of the lists, but unfortunately it has been overrated, the sequence and rhythm is v slow, many incidents historically untrue, no scene has left any kind of impact, sorry but the truth is ""easily forgettable movie"". I'm not convinced that the scenes show the Jews in their miserable conditions under the Nazis had any influence on the human feelings, i never felt any kind of sadness or sympathy towards them as the movie should, but monotony and long waiting moments. If there is honest rating for the movie it should bottom the lists, watching such film just a waste of time. No added value or information or any kind of entertainment could be gained."
tt0114369,"I saw it just now because some people were accusing The Batman (that I loved) of copying it. However, there veery few similarities between these movies aside from been dark detective movies.The movie Se7en is great except by the end. The end was a bit sloth since it was hardly the detective work that took them to the end of the mystery. Not withstanding, there is a certain doubt at the end of the movie about what truly happened and what will be the future.Despite this, until the last 40 minutes, the movie has great dialogue, action, mystery, character development and ambience. It makes you wonder every turn what will happen next.Another bad side is that there are very few characters, thus very few suspects. You know some people will surely get involved because there is no one else to look for."
tt0114369,"It had a very promising start. Opening credits were interesting and the photography was wonderful. All was going well until we were introduced to the main characters (Freeman and Pitt).Basically these characters are overly simplistic and rather cliched.Freeman the extremely well learned and rational cop and Pitt the gung-ho non-intellectual (anti) are about as believable as munchkins.Unfortunately this movie seems to have been made to gratuitous ly use hollywoods most popular actors (at the time) rather than a good movie.Sorry, watch Silence of the Lambs if you want a good movie of this genre.mho"
tt0111161,"An overrated film that I watched as a teenager and recently decided to re-watch. I must say right away that I like this film, but it is undeservedly and too popular and occupies the first line - this is completely undeserved in comparison with other films of more talented authors.
I am very saddened that people do not see other works, and for so long this film has been number one among the best films. The actors are talented, the plot is just good, not brilliant, like Stanley Kubrick in ""A Space Odyssey"". Even this I am ready to see in the top-1, but not ""Shawshank Redemption"". I understand that many will disagree with me or say that I just hate, but this is not true, and you can understand this by comparing it with other films, is this film so good and does it deserve the first place?"

tt0139414,"This movie isn't THAT bad but it could have been so much better: I dig Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda a lot (for different reasons) and it was written by David E. Kelley, who used to be great (Picket Fences) but has turned into a woman by writing ALley McBeal for too long. How else can you explain a movie ABOUT a man-eating crocidile who only eat ONE man in the whole movie?!! Did he not want it to be too violent?Contrary too what some think, the perfomrances are good and the croc does look very realistic - I just expected more excitement/carnage and I think most people watching this will too. Remember that girl who gets killed while skinny-dipping in the beginning of Jaws? Could you imagine if she was the ONLY victim in the entire movie? That would have been awful lame. SInce I like the concept and Pullman and FOnda are so appealing, I would love to see a sequel, but since it bombed at the box office, I guess there's no chance of them trying to get it right the second time around."

And they got the opportunity to have elaborated roles to play, not just appearing in the background; Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth is probably the finest of the great ones. Moreover, it is no comic strip movie, but an epic story of universal values, attitudes and issues, with superhero and sci-fi moments complementing the script, not governing it.Minuses from me due to length (ca 2,5 hours) and too obvious references/comparisons with characters from other hit movies (e.g. Hannibal, Catwoman, James Bond). But still, the movie is worth watching and recommendable!"
tt0172495,"The biggest single indictment of this disatrous excuse for an epic is that the one truly great actor in the movie, Derek Jacobi, is (like Richard Harris and Oliver Reed) brought in to bring a whiff of authentic class (to hide the other whiffs), and, like the others, is quickly snuffed.  Jacobi, of course, was the absolutely brilliant star of the probably the greatest Roman epic ever, I, CLAUDIUS.  That scintillating 13-hour classic doesn't have a single boring or predictable moment (unlike this mess) and is all characterization and plotting, not spectacle, the exact opposite of this movie, which uses character stereotypes and a ludicrous storyline that wouldn't pass the cartoon test.  Half the acting is Russell Crowe swearing revenge and grimacing as he flexes his pectorals.  Even the spectacle here is MUDDY and BLOODY.  If you want to be like the Romans and enjoy the sight of people being disemboweled and torn limb from limb, then by all means check this out.  But, please, watch one of the classics instead and you'll quickly dump this pretender."
tt0114369,"'He is preaching¬Ö.punishing'.Serial killing with clues from killer is not a new thing to Hollywood but David Fincher's Se7en exceptional. Its evil genius. Se7en opens with a homicide where a fatso is killed in a very strange manner. We meet Detective Somerset(Freeman) who is about to take off and detective David Mills(Pitt) has just fought to get assigned there. Somerset is calm, mature and has achieved mastery over his job. He probably seen so much that now he badly wants to go far away from this bloodshed. David appears cocky first but turns out amiable character of the film. Tracey(Palthow) is David's wife who hasn't got used to with guns even after so many years of their marriage.It begins. Each killing is shockingly repellent. Like an artist's signature every victim holds a note, a sin highlighted with lines from Dante Alighieri' s 'Divine Comedy', Shakespeare's 'Merchant of Venice'. And his name is John Doe(Kevin Spacey). Those lines are screaming that this not just some insanity. He wants to make a point.Each murder is done by reaching horrific extremes of those deadly sins. A fat man is fed until he burst. Then there is an infamous lawyer got gun stuck on his head, handed a knife -a weighing scale is in front of him and he has to cut 1 pound of flesh from his body by himself. A druggist tied to bed for a whole year!! A famous model, her nose is cut and bandaged again and gave a choice- phone in one hand to call help n sleeping pills in other one to die rather than live deformed. A whore is punished ruthlessly that you should see on screen only. John says, ""The world is so shitty¬Öand we get used to them"".This Script is sumptuous. It mirrors today's society skillfully and boldly. Nothing is hidden by the camera. All we watch is naked truth that we hate to admit and most of the time that we hardly care. The spirituality woven in has its impact all over. Most of all ending is a blow. It is stunning.There are number of memorable sequences in Seven. One especially is breath-taking when Somerset and Mills reaches John doe's apartment and Doe directly starts shooting at them and chase sequence followed is absolute fabulous. On other hand dinner party at Mills house we feel wine mixed in the air. Tracey and Somerset's meeting at coffee shop is the finest ones I ever seen. The intensity of that conversation can't be described.This is a very dark film. It is all time raining. All environment surrounding Se7en is so grim and ghastly it clouds viewers with the same. Music refuse to leave us even when it is over. I must mention titles and credits rolled, one of the best I ever seen.Se7en comes out with strong performances. Morgan Freeman is truly outstanding. Brad Pitt made me his fan from this movie. The way he says ""Ladies and Gentleman we have a homicide here"" and same David when taunted by Somerset ""You are saying you care for these people?"" says with assuring impulse ""Sure I do¬Ö.!!!"". Gwyneth Paltrow 's Tracey doesn't have much screen presence but when she is there, we just can not stop love her character. In final half an hour we are introduced to Kevin Spacey's John Doe. The preacher. What can I say about this chilling work? Spacey gave such a performance that stings. We hate to admit with this man but somewhere we know he is right. Somerset asks him, ""So you are saying some higher power tell you to do this?"" Just watch John Doe reply ""Lord works in mysterious ways.."". Interesting thing pointed out by one of the fan is Somerset and John Doe both observed the same facts about today's society but responds in different ways, Somerset want to run away and Doe takes action.No matter how many thrillers I shall see but this will always one of my favorites. It affects deeply. That's the power of Se7en. Se7en is a terrific thriller and a modern classic."
tt0068646,"This movie isnt that good but it's definitely not bad. Everyone talks about this movie like it's some masterpiece but quite frankly it's boring in some scenes, got to so bored the first time watching that I stopped watching a few times that day."
tt1345836,"I feel The Dark Knight Rises is the best of Nolan's Trilogy in overall entertainment. The hallmark of this series is its dark, gritty realism, at least as realistic as you can get for a superhero movie. I prefer this approach to the semi-goofy style of the 1989-97 series.Bane's a formidable villain and Anne Hatheway surprisingly plays a good ""Catwoman"" (I say ""surprisingly"" only because I thought she has too innocent/sweet of a quality to pull off the role). Also on hand is Marion Cotillard, who's stunning as Miranda Tate, and Joseph Gordon-Levite, who's effective as police officer Blake. Beyond these we get the principal characters/cast of the first two films, minus the Joker and Harvey Dent.My only beef with this series is that the plots are convoluted and there's an overload of characters, which means you really have to pay attention or you'll get lost in the process. This is never a problem when a story is ultra-compelling, but none of these films are, although ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is definitely the most compelling of the three. This factor is what keeps this series from being great in my opinion.But don't take that the wrong way; I'm just being honest. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a quality Batman film.The film runs 165 minutes and was shot in Pittsburgh (Gotham City), England, Scotland, India, Italy, New York, Newark and California.GRADE: B+"
tt0137523,"First and Second rule of Fight Club: Don't talk about Fight Club. So I guess I wont. But what I will say is that this movie will blow your mind, and iam not exaggerating. This is one hell of a crazy cinematic experience. Warning! You will never quite view liposuction the same way again."
tt0251677,"This film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living in a rural Cuban town the year of the Castro revolution. It is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love.The names CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are merely attempts to wrongly market this as an action film. DREAMING OF JULIA makes much more sense. It has more in common with European cinema than with RAMBO and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to people's daily lives and pursuits. That fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this time period in Cuban history.The excessive use of the voice-over narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for it with unqualified clips from Hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator could.The comparisons to CINEMA PARADISO and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies, but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love.The revolution, like the film JULIE, never seems to have an ending."
tt0429078,"I really wanted this film to be good - I'd been waiting to see it for a long time. Unfortunately, the start is about as good as it gets - it's all very slowly down hill from there on.With a great cast and director, this kicked the required amount of arse but... something was just missing.Donnie's made much better films, as has Tsui Hark. The old boy - whose name eludes me right now - has been around for a while, and Drunken Monkey would be a much better film to check out than this for a take on his skills.In terms on the plot: the Chinese Emperor has decreed that martial arts are to no longer be practised by commoners; this causes the camp General and his army of Goths to slaughter villages at random, claiming everyone to be a practitioner. And for 300 pieces of silver per head, why not? Oh yeah, each of his sub-generals has a bizarre weapon to be recognised by. Sigh, you can guess that this one's going to be thin in story value.The martial arts are okay, but I've seen better. The sword play's okay, but again, we've all seen a lot better.Watch it if you want to - it's worth seeing if only to assess it for yourself - but for me, it was very disappointing (although I did watch Rocky Balboa the same day, which was excellent and the cream of the Rocky crop)."
tt0816692,"I like movies. I watch them a lot. I personally know 2 of the actors in this film, and also some people connected to the scoring. After all the hype I was geared up to watch it. I fell asleep once within the first hour and drifted in and out of consciousness throughout the film. It's too long, waaay to much dialogue - a completely bombastic storyline and Matthew just irritated me.I could give a much more well rounded review and get all academic - but its not worth it. I really can't sum up the words to say how much of a dull experience this was. There are some crazy visuals once they eventually get into space - but the dialogue and the actual audio mix is really lame.Watch it if you really have nothing else to do - or perhaps if you're a drug user it might work better under the influence. Since I don't take drugs - that's just a wild guess - it might - actually - make it even worse.One thing for sure - I wouldn't watch it again. Not for all the tea in China."
tt0361748,"Brad Pitt is undercover in Nazi Germany during World War II with a secret mission to kill Hitler. Will he succeed or die trying?The bad: this plot is rather silly at key moments, because some events that take place are simply not true to life or highly unlikely. Dont wanna nag about that flaw too much though, but it is a thing that bugs me nevertheless and it makes me only wanna award it with 8 stars, instead of 9 or 10.The good: the suspense is terrific. Tarantino is a master at building up suspense in long lasting scenes. The dialogues and characters are to die for, ranging from violently wicked to hilariously stupid.This is one of my favourite Tarantino movies of the last 20 years. It nowhere near equals Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs or Jackie Brown, but it comes close. Seen it many many times and I will enjoy it many more times to come."
tt0111161,"At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the ""only"" guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words ""His judgment cometh and that right soon."" The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption."" Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb: there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the ""sisters,"" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the ""redemption"" is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The Godfather) at the IMDb. Don't miss it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)"
tt0110912,Can't help but love it!üñ§ bcoz it's good cool brilliant? I watched it over agian and again.
tt0468569,Excellent film and great performance by Heath Ledger
tt0109830,"I have only read and heard good things about this Oscar winning film; most people consider it to be one of the greatest films ever made. But after watching the movie, I just wonder what is it that others found but I couldn't? It was an alright film, but there was nothing exceptional in it. There are a number of things in the film that leave you puzzled and don't make any sense at all. It's the journey of a boy who just went with the flow and did what was asked of him, and with the help of a few miracles achieved success at every step of his life. It's always nice to witness a character's journey, from being nobody to someone special, except that this wasn't a very exciting or an interesting journey, despite the roller coaster life that he had and all the historical events that the filmmaker associated him with.Forrest Gump says, ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get""; does it even make any sense? What exactly would anyone expect from a box of chocolates? I don't think you would get fruits or cake or vegetables from a box of chocolates. Even if the chocolates are of different shapes, or have some flavours, it would still be a chocolate, otherwise it won't be labelled 'box of chocolates'.Robin Wright acted well and looked extremely beautiful, but I just couldn't understand what was going on in her mind. What did she want from life? Why did she keep running away from Forrest and towards the worst kind of people? For some reason, Forest Gump was head over heels in love with her, she acknowledges it as well and yet just keeps running away from him. Forrest wasn't really a very intelligent guy, so it's understandable if a woman doesn't wish to be his girlfriend; but why was Jenny so hell bent on destroying her own life, I just couldn't understand. Unlike all the men in her life, Forrest actually cared for her and yet she just didn't want to live with him.The way Forrest got admission in school was just terrible. Why would any woman go to that extent? Did she have no apprehensions in sending her son to a school which had a molester in the name of a Principal? No mother would allow herself to be exploited like that. What was the director trying to tell us through that scene?The character of Bubba is extremely irritating. Why does he constantly keep talking about Shrimps? How is it that he has nothing else to talk about? Bubba's constant blabbering about Shrimps made no sense at all. Perhaps the director and the writer wanted him to be the comic relief of the movie, but unfortunately they failed miserably.At one point of time, Forrest decides to just run and do nothing else. Now, I get it, he was angry and frustrated with Jenny; people do tend to go for long walks or a long run to express their anger, but who runs for three years nonstop? Why did Forrest do that? What did he achieve from all that running? Just because he could run fast, doesn't mean he would run all over the country for three years for no reason at all! Also, he was eating, sleeping and going to the bathroom all this while, he hadn't lost his mind; so why was he running? What made him stop? Was he trying to forget Jenny? If that was the case then why did he immediately go back to her after all that running? There are no logical explanations for anything that happens in this film.There were some good things for sure in the film and deserve to be mentioned. The music composed by Alan Silvestri is extremely beautiful. It perfectly supports the innocence and optimism of the lead character. The acting by everyone was great; Tom Hanks has given a top quality performance, his acting makes the film look good. Tom plays a man who is slower than normal people, but he never tries to overplay the part, he never tries to mock people who might be suffering from this disability. Tom Hanks remained consistently grounded throughout the film. Gary Sinise was brilliant as Lieutenant Dan, Forrest Gump's senior officer. The storm sequence, or the miracle moment, in which Dan climbs up on top of the boat for a showdown with the almighty was an extremely powerful scene and Gary did very well in it. The special effects are truly remarkable, it's quite amazing how they have managed to insert Forrest Gump in the footage from the years gone by; it may not have added anything to the storyline, but the technical department deserves some praise for their work.Not everyone has the same taste, some may like what others don't. For some, Forrest Gump might be an Oscar worthy film, but to me it just didn't seem like something that I would even recommend anyone to watch."
tt0114369,"Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt made a great team in this movie. I really liked the dynamics of their characters, with one being the mature and intelligent one while the other is younger and more reckless. The movie wouldn't have been as entertaining if both characters had similar personalities. And watching this in 2022, I really liked how Freeman's character was written; he had experienced the vicissitudes of life and that made him wiser.The plot was good and gripping and I enjoyed the pacing of it as well. The crimes were very violent in nature but luckily they weren't too explicit. And for something that was filmed in the 90s, the special effects were amazing. The ending was shocking and it was interesting to see how each character reacted to the situation.Overall, it was a good movie."
tt0848228,"I just saw the early screening for San Diego through the top 10 cities on facebook who got them. And suffice to say I am glad I was privileged enough to.First off, this hands down is the best Marvel movie ever. I don't say that lightly. And in terms of superhero movie with maybe the Nolan Batman series being tied with this, I thought Whedon did an amazing job to bring out all these characters in this one movie. I especially like what was done with Hawkeye and Black Widow just because those two didn't really have their individual movie with their back story.You can tell when a comic book fan writes and directs a comic movie because it clearly showed in all areas of production for this film. Going into the film I honestly thought that a lot of the cool mutant action scenes would be strictly Iron Man and Captain America. But Whedon does such a great job giving each mutant their 15 mins of fame and by the end of it you seriously feel like ""Wow this guy/chick is a badass"" for every mutant. I will admit i am not a Hulk fan. I like the inner story for it but was never a fan of the films, show or comic. But Hulk's role in the movie is so awesome I became a fan just from it.If any of you are Whedon fans then you guys/girls will love this movie. It has his M.O. written all over the humor and story presentation. And there were definitely parts in the movie where I thought ""Wow this seems like Firefly and Serenity"". And story aside, if you read, watched, or idolized Marvel superheros as a kid, the action alone will make you cheer just out of sheer nostalgia of imagining The Avengers or X-Men all together on the screen kicking ass.In summation, I don't need to say you NEED to watch this movie because I think anybody who is anybody already knows they want to see this. All this review has done was just reaffirm the hype behind this movie. I don't say this much but job well done Marvel and Disney for hiring a writer/director who has the audaciousness to keep it honest and true for those most dedicated comic fans who are the backbone of Marvel comics being a success. And in this day and age of superhero movies and movies in general that is very hard to do. Cheers Joss Whedon!"
tt0372784,"First of all, I have to say that I enjoyed the previous Batman series, directed by Tim Burton for several and then by Joel Schumacher. As good as that series was, this start of a new series would fall flat if all it does was copy the last one.But this series (and it will be a series it seems) certainly has its differences. It was less fantasy based and more realistic. To be sure, Batman still does some pretty amazing things. But this time, at least some of it seems more believable. At the start, Batman even loses a few fights - at least as Bruce Wayne. And he even seems to have a few fears. And Gotham City, almost appears to be similar to a real city. This Batman is more realistic, somewhat similar to the Spiderman series that is also going on. In both cases, the audience knows that the hero is still human and actually has a chance of losing and is concerned about that.This realistic approach works, and works well. Not only did our group greatly enjoy the movie, but we are very much looking forward to the next ones in the series. The acting, casting and direction were well done. And of course the action was both creative and fun - as one might expect.The premiere that I went to see was not as crowded as one might expect. However, those people that were there stood up and applauded at the end of the movie. One seldom sees that."
tt0111161,"I was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked #1 out of all possible candidates in the IMDB user ratings. When I thought about it, though, it made more sense--this is a ""Rocky""-type feel-good movie that doesn't really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature. Don't get me wrong--it's a fine film (I gave it a solid 7 out of 10), it's just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_ and _The Graduate_.I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script and characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who isn't a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt, bigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a brutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict who knows all the ropes and can't live on the outside, and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before? Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There's really nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King, who doesn't really do well with complex characters (a problem I noted as far back as _Carrie_).If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which this movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either _The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some chance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think, go with the late great Stanley Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_.I couldn't stop thinking about the warden: doesn't he have a family? How did they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the prison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.I'm not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product with nothing special to commend it."
tt0468569,"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that seamlessly blends intense action, profound storytelling, and unforgettable performances. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of mesmerizing, elevating the film to unparalleled heights. Nolan's direction, coupled with Hans Zimmer's iconic score, creates a dark and immersive atmosphere that captivates audiences from start to finish. The film's exploration of morality and the complexities of heroism cements its status as a modern masterpiece in the superhero genre.Nolan's visionary storytelling and Bale's compelling Batman make ""The Dark Knight"" a timeless masterpiece."
tt0372784,"I cannot remember the last time I was so disappointed with a movie. I went into BATMAN BEGINS with pretty much no expectations, and I was very disappointed. I actually felt sad on the way home afterwards because I was so disappointed. I really can't even think of much that I did like. Christian Bale was alright, but the only scene where he really shined as Batman was when he interrogates a crooked cop atop a fire escape. But otherwise, he was just so-so as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. I missed seeing Michael Gough as Alfred, but Michael Caine was the highlight of the film, without question. My favorite scene of the whole film is in a flashback where Alfred tells young Bruce that his parents' murder wasn't his fault. The rest of the cast was okay, except for Katie Holmes, badly miscast as a District Attorney. Gary Oldman fared pretty well as a pre-Commissioner James Gordon (he certainly looked the part), but he's given almost nothing to do and seems to only be in a handful of scenes. Rutger Hauer is the CEO of Wayne Enterprises in a subplot that isn't needed at all. I couldn't help but feel that a lot of the movie was just padding that could have easily been trimmed out.As for the villains, we get the Scarecrow, Ra's al Ghul, and Carmine Falcone, a local gangster. Now, I know the point of this movie was to make it Batman's film, but the villains were handled so badly I practically felt cheated. The Scarecrow, one of my favorite of Batman's Rogues Gallery, is seriously wasted. He's no longer the Ichabod Craine-looking college professor, but instead a sophisticated-looking pretty boy psychologist. In the comics, his poisons cause people to experience their greatest fears. Here, they simply make people act crazy more than anything else. Ra's al Ghul is also wasted. He appears to be killed early on, but turns up later in an unnecessary plot twist that reveals Ducard (Liam Neeson) is really Ra's, the one we saw killed having only been a decoy. Thus, Ra's is absent for a good bulk of the film, and as a result fails to make much impact as a villain. Even worse, the ""villain"" shifts constantly, from being Falcone to Scarecrow to Ra's, instead of just giving us one for Batman to deal with, the way it should be. This was the problem with the third and fourth Batman films, and I was very surprised to see them falling for it again in this film. (Anybody remember how well it worked out for the first BATMAN and SPIDER-MAN when when you've only got one villain?) It just really ticked me off how they handled the villains, because they were using two of the most interesting ones. We saw glimpses of Scarecrow's potential in a few moments, and when he finally gallops into the thick of the action at the end, on horseback and (finally) in full Scarecrow costume, we expect to really see things hit the fan. But what happens? He gets zapped with a stun gun by Katie Holmes and runs off screaming into the night like a little girl, never to be seen again. What!? And Falcone was a total waste. We already had two other much more interesting bad guys, so we could have done without him.Other things that irked me: I really hated the Batmobile, even more so after seeing it in action instead of just pictures. And the scene where it jumps across rooftops? Geez, wasn't the point of restarting the franchise to get away from the junk we got in the last two films? I couldn't believe it. The murder of Bruce Wayne's parents was also poorly-handled. It had much more emotional impact in Tim Burton's BATMAN, where I actually felt sadness seeing it happen as opposed to this one, where it's over and done with before you can really react to it. (Which I guess is something they might have intended, but it still had no affect on me.) And Gotham City! I know Christopher Nolan has said they wanted to make a ""realistic"" Batman film, sort of bringing him ""into the real world."" Well, it clearly doesn't work. The Gotham City of Tim Burton's film lived up to its name. Here, the movie could have just as easily taken place in Los Angeles. And this is really just a small complaint, but Batman's gadgets were hardly used. Where's his gas pellets during his escapes (like we saw demonstrated for him earlier in the film)? And the Batarangs were virtually missing in action. The action scenes, what few there are, were terrible. The MTV-style editing and camera work didn't help, practically drowning out any suspense and excitement they may have had. Half the time, I couldn't even tell what was going on and who was hitting who. And the excessive use of flashbacks in the first act made me feel like I was watching an episode of LOST.By the time the movie was over and I was heading out of the theater, I really didn't even feel like I had just seen a Batman movie, but something else entirely. It's really a shame. The film had lots of potential, and after eight years of waiting, this is all we get. It could have been something really good. I know everybody's raving about it, but I really didn't see the big deal. I thought it was pretty lackluster. Perhaps if the writer hadn't been David S. Goyer? Who knows? All I know is that I'm extremely disappointed. Of the four live-action Batman movies (not counting the one with Adam West), I guess I'd rank BATMAN BEGINS at Number 4, right behind BATMAN, BATMAN RETURNS, and even BATMAN FOREVER. It seems that SPIDER-MAN's place as the best superhero movie of all-time isn't likely to be challenged anytime soon.BATMAN BEGINS: 3/10"
tt0108052,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."
tt0133093,"Apart from the visuals, this film is dead dull. The plot started out quite interesting, setting up a virtual world and real world, with interesting quirks that make you think we could possibly be in the matrix but then the main plot is just the typical generic; is he the chosen one, no he isn't, yes he is, no he isn't, well of course he is otherwise it wouldn't be a movie. If you're just looking for an easy watch it is enjoyable but could have been a much better film."
tt0848228,"Without a doubt, THE AVENGERS is the most expensive video game ever produced; why the techs would want to try to integrate live-action elements, however, is beyond me: the cartoon was okay without them. Robert Downey has the best lines (half a dozen one-liners, to be precise), though Thor's contention that Loki ""was adopted"" was just as funny. Sam Jackson looks just plain bored throughout- which is saying a lot when one considers the fact that he's the most overrated actor in Hollywood. You know a movie's heavily padded when fully one-third of it could be cut and never missed: the first third of this game is mind-numbingly clich√©d and plays out like yet another pseudo-military video game (what used to be called ""first-person shooter"" games but are nowadays referred to as ""first-person action"" games) or television show the likes of which we've seen a thousand times. The skrull at the end was a nice little touch, but I wonder why comics- and now their celluloid incarnations- tend to focus on alien invasions for their ""big get-togethers"" when there are more than enough wannabe tyrants here on Earth...? I think John Carpenter (THEY LIVE) and George Romero (LAND OF THE DEAD) had it right: we have seen The Enemy, and He is Us. Give me RODNEY CECIL, PSYCHO HERO any day."
tt0068646,"Over the years, I had heard a lot about this movie but, for some reason, had never seen it. About two years ago, I found myself with a free evening and began searching for a movie to watch online. I ran across The Godfather and thought all right, I'll finally get to see this masterpiece!Although I began watching it with high expectations, they were gone within about 20 minutes. I found it to be boring to the extreme and almost turned it off on several occasions, but I decided to stick with it in the hope that it would improve. Unfortunately, it didn't. By the time that it had ended, I was actually mad that I had wasted over two hours of my life watching it.I realize that I'm in the extreme minority, but I absolutely did not like this movie at all."
tt0372784,"Two Words: Batman Begins.The Batman franchise has been resurrected and it is better than ever. I can't stress enough on how good this movie is. Christopher Nolan directed (and co-wrote) a darker Batman that is portrayed perfectly by Christian Bale. A new youth and energy has been drawn out of the Batman legend and displayed perfectly. All of the performances in this movie are stellar, and each one does not seem out of place or pointless. The music keeps your blood pumping with the action and never lets up. And speaking of the action, you haven't seen anything until you see the Batmobile in motion. This thing is mint. I honestly wish that I could write something a lot better about this movie and go into great lengths of describing each piece of this glorious pie; but in all honesty, I will simply ruin the movies for others. I am not one to keep secrets. So please end my torment and go watch this movie. Then I will have people to talk to about it."
tt0120815,"Overall, this is a well made film that is not well written.  Sure the opening scenes (Normandy) are dramatic and touch you deeply, but as soon as the allies secure the beach, the movie begins to fail.Surely there is a better script for a film about WWII in the European theater that would have served as a good vehicle for the dramatic first half-hour in this movie."
tt0137523,"Fight Club deals with the disappointment and estrangement that men have in modern society.The protagonist, portrayed by Edward Norton, can't sleep and feels like he has an empty life. First he starts visiting support groups for diseases he does not have to get his sleep back. But then he decides to fight, just fight, and he starts a fight club, which grows fast with other disappointed men.This is a great analysis in the movie, that a lot of people are doing things all day that are estranged from nature. People are biologically build to have physical exercise all day, but many of them for example sit in an office all day.Another good aspect in the movie is that there are a lot of hints showing that Tyler Durden is the same person as the narrator.Also, excellent acting by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt and excellent directing by David Fincher."
tt0133093,"What made The Matrix special was the groundbreaking visual effects such as 'Bullet Time' that have been often imitated in other films and video games. The Wachowski's simply knocked it out of the park when it came to the visuals.Keanu Reeves is Mr Anderson an ordinary computer programmer by day and secret hacker called Neo at night who is suddenly pursued by government agents led by a sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) after he is contacted by computer hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne.)Morpheus believes Neo is the 'One.' Humans lives in a false reality that controls humans and Neo will lead the harvested humans to rebel against the machines creating the false reality.The film mixes cyberpunk science fiction with Hong Kong style martial arts and elements of Japanese manga type animation as inspiration.Keanu Reeves is in his element in a world where he does not understand what is around him. He looks cool and does well in the martial arts sequences. I guess revisiting this genre made up for the failure of Johnny Mnemonic.Laurence Fishburne is even more cooler as Morpheus guiding Neo in this hostile new reality and how to take down the system. Carrie-Anne Moss is kick ass sexy in black leather as Trinity who displays superhuman powers.The film has philosophical underpinnings as the Wachowski's ask us to think about the world around us and our place within it.The subtext of the film can be re-analysed in light of the personal journeys of the Wachowskis. Change and transformation. It is laughable to see the right wing attempting to co-opt the movie for their own agenda.The film is cool, it is hip but I felt slightly too long and little bit too po faced. However the Wachowskis did manage to catch lightning in a bottle which they did not manage to do with the following two sequels."
tt0137523,"Fight Club is one of the greatest movies movies of all time... through the first 110 minutes. The film is about a man who has become a corporate slave, he sees no value or meaning in his life anymore. Because of this he goes to support groups in hopes that the pain of others will enable him to feel something, anything at all. The movie lays out a story that is entirely believable, considering people's tendencies of overworking, and the isolation many people feel in this modern world. Perhaps in the not-so-distant future people will feel the need to beat the hell out of each other to feel alive and connected. So far, in the film, you have grown attached to the characters and are immersed in the reality of what could be. The ending, ah the ending. The first 110 minutes of this movie are rated a 10/10 in my book, the last half hour or so brings the final rating down three points. The ending fit perfectly into a movie that was science fiction based. However this doesn't work. This movie bases its entire story around the idea that this kind of thing could really happen. The ending throws everything out the window. By the time this movie is over you might feel cheated, and rightfully so. To have science fiction like ending to this movie is almost as bad as making an entire movie a dream, you cannot do it! Salpping that ending onto this movie makes the entire thing feel pretentious and phony. Many will tell you that this is not the case, and that I just don't appreciate the twist at the end. To formulate your own opinion, well you will just have to watch this for yourself. Good luck and, please, give me some feedback."
tt0361748,"I haven't enjoyed a Tarantino flick since Kill Bill, and IB does nothing to make me change my mind. I was mostly bored during the movie, because it seemed like Tarantino was doing nothing new here, merely recycling his older tricks. I think he ought to stop hyping himself so much, and maybe skip directing for a while, in favour or writing. That's his strength, really. As a director, he's lately been just too self-indulgent.As for the movie, the title itself is misleading. The Basterds were hardly in the movie. But I'm not complaining, because they were more caricatures, than serious characters. If Tarantino had elected to completely edit away Aldo The Apache and The Bear Jew, and make the movie only about Shoshanna, I couldn't be happier. Her plot was the only part that actually seemed like a coherent story. In fact, if I will ever get 'round to watching this movie on TV, I'll skip through all the frivolousness and just watch her scenes.Still, my favourite sequence in the movie also featured the only Basterd I liked, Til Schweiger's Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz (who ironically, isn't even an original American Basterd). This is the clandestine basement meet with Diane Kruger's Bridget von Hammersmark, where Murphy's Law is in full effect - basically everything that can go wrong, does - followed by the awesome shootout.And how can I not talk about Hans Landa, the Jew Hunter! His performance towers above everyone elses, and he rightly deserves his Cannes best actor award. His ending however, was atrocious, and a major disservice to him. The whole idea that he would even consider surrendering to the Americans seemed kind of lame. He just didn't seem like the traitorous or turn-coat types to me. Basically Tarantino built up his character, and had no idea what to do with him, so he got one of the worst endings possible.All in all, this is a juvenile escapist fantasy, and not a very interesting one at that. I am, of course, in the vast minority that didn't like it, as most of my other friends seem to act as if this movie is the cure for cancer. Cure for insomnia is more like it."
tt7286456,"There appears to be sharply divided reactions to this film. Reading some of the other reviews, people thought it was brilliant, or a piece of garbage.
My own opinion - I hated it. The best aspect of Joker is Joaquin Phoenixs' acting. He did a great job with a crappy script and a mostly incoherent story. Forget any relation to the Heath Ledger portrayal of Joker, which was smart and perfectly played. This version of Joker has little to do with Batman, although there are scattered connections in the film.
I'm sorry I watched this. Guess I hoped it would get better, but for me, it just stayed at awful throughout."
tt0109830,"After all the hype and promotion, I was disappointed at the lack of content. The scenes of nudity and sexuality were unnecessary and made a film which could have been great an embarrassment for those of us who prefer to stay out of other folks' bedrooms.  The acting by Mr. Hanks, however, was superb. (The only reason I gave it a ""3"" instead of a ""1"")  He made me empathize with, and love, Forrest.  His portrayal of this gentle man was the bright spot in this fatally flawed movie."
tt0167261,"... it looks like I'm going to have consign myself to the minority here and state that I was seriously disappointed with this movie. Not that it was actually bad, but there were some very weighty flaws that left me squirming in exasperation.Where to begin? Well, it DRAGGED - oh, how it dragged! The first one did too (though it works better on DVD), but this one topped it. There were pointless changes to the characterization from the novel and the effects were very variable, though the Gollum character was brilliantly realized.I left the cinema at the end feeling even more cheated than with the first installment. I'll probably buy the DVD when it's issued, in the hope that the movie flows better in that medium, as the first one did. It needs to.Rating: 6/10."
tt0422272,"Fragile had some potential, but the lack of explanation about come characters' back-history really detracted from this film. The ghost scenes were really not that scary, and the powers of the ghost to tear down the building were a little over the top.Starting from the beginning... Calista Flockhart's acting was over the top; she was inexplicably rude and off-color with all other actors on screen, and the rest of the cast was too tolerant of her wild behaviors & tantrums.Secondly, we get nothing of her past. Supposedly, she has a past of accidentally letting some child die on her last nursing job, and is now a self-loathing pill-popping mess, but we never find out the story.Thirdly, the phenomenon happening in the hospital is pretty crazy, but once the full story is revealed by the film's end, the only word that came to my mind was ""weak"". Honestly, it's like the film maker was reaching for a powerful theme, but just... tried too hard. It wasn't a bad film, but I definitely think some of the reviews for this one are misleading. It was not really that scary at all. Yes, there was a ghost, yes she was evil, and yes she wasted people, but all in all, it was just sort of bland.Some interesting characters and some good writing at points, but overall effect was just... bland. Lack-luster. I simply was not scared at all, and I'm not a particularly difficult movie-goer to please. In fact, I scare quite easily, but this one just failed to pack any punch.It's not the worst ghost film I've ever seen; not by a long shot, but it left me wishing I'd made another selection that night from my Netflix line-up... Oh well. Better luck tomorrow night."
tt0468569,"Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) accords a deal with the lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and his sweetheart-assistant(Maggie Gyllenhaal) for eliminate definitively criminality at Ghotam. However , a mysterious delinquent and psychotic villain named The Joker (Heath Ledger)begins a new wave of criminal rampage and terror. Batman is only helped by his attendant named Alfred(Michael Caine) and his scientific (Morgan Freeman).This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie . Full of action , it's complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming computer generator special effects. The picture relies in terrific flying sequences , impressive fights, and breathtaking pursuits. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¬®Batman begins (2005)¬® also directed by Christopher Nolan ; booth movies result to be an intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book creation. Our superhero, well incarnated by Christian Bale dons the suit and cape, for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Batman and he deserves credit for remaining true to character.A well-intentioned and interesting plot by David S. Goyer based on the characters created by Bob Kane, following the events developed in Batman Begins and repeating some actors as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy , among others. Suspenseful musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard , and colorful, dark cinematography by Wally Pfister. The film takes off to provide some great moments and great fun as Superman swings into action. The picture is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan who has directed excellent movies as ¬®The prestige¬®, ¬®Insomnia ¬® and ¬®Memento¬® and is preparing Batman third part. This live action Batman was one of the highest grossing movie made in that year, as well as, Nolan's most prestigious efforts in that field. Rating : Very good. Better than average."
tt0110912,"Overrated is an understatement. This movie is start to finish garbage. I though Reservoir Dogs was an OK movie, and I liked Inglourious Basterds a lot. I don't have a problem with violent or perverse content in movies (My all-time favorite is David Fincher's Fight Club), but this movie is just crap. I understand the nostalgic aura about how this movie ""revolutionized"" what was acceptable to do in movies, but that doesn't make it a good movie by any means.The acting as a whole was entirely sub-par. As usual, Samuel L. Jackson's acting is consistent with the career he has built on shouting (a la ""Snakes on a Plane"") and contributed nothing positive to the movie. Same goes for John Travolta, whose acting was arguably worse than Jackson's. There's a significant unconvincing ""memorization"" tone to his lines. The only reason this is considered to have resurrected his career is because he was in the movie at all; once the movie became a cult classic, he became the marketable actor he once was.I already said I don't have a problem with movies that contain explicit language, but in Pulp Fiction, there are certain instances where too many expletives are inserted, and I'm not sure for what effect. If you listen to Tarentino's lines (as Jimmy) and Jackson's lines (when they're cleaning out the car), I think these lines best exemplify the overkill I'm talking about.Another thing about the movie is it is generally not relatable. I realize this seems like not a legitimate complaint- after all, how marketable would a movie really be if it was wholly relatable? However, I just felt like the over-glorification heroin use, among other aspects really turned me off. Also, usually movies that glorify or portray behavior/lifestyles similar to those depicted in Pulp Fiction have characters that are normal human beings. In this movie, every character is either a murderer, a gangster, a drug dealer, someone with a drug problem, an accomplice to a crime, or a rapist. I just don't see the redeeming social value here.If you like movies with quality acting, character development, any sort of plot, or a message that doesn't bash the Bible; chances are Pulp Fiction is not for you. The one thing that Tarentino got right was the title: Pulp Fiction; this movie is both ""cheaply produced art"" and ""fake."""
tt1375666,"This movie is just disappointing and dreadfully bad. People are victims of the marketing campaign: ""this movie is complex, intellectual and multi-layered and if you don't understand it then you are stupid"". People don't like to be stupid and having seen that it's written, produced and directed by the same guy who did The Dark Knight they don't think anymore and go to see Inception.So, I will show you that Mr. Nolans movie is the opposition of ""complex and intelligent"": SUPERFICIAL. I have at least 6 arguments:1. The characters are just silhouettes, transparent and shallow. There is no psychological deepness; the protagonists are emotionless objects moved from place to place like chess figures. They don't have any soul. But what marked a movie is his developing of characters. Sure, you try to create something deep with the relationship between DiCaprio and Cotillard but it's just pathetic, amateurish and stereotypic. And then the kids' back that we see so often that it gets on the viewer's nerves.2. The music by Hans Zimmer is a torture. It's so loud and indifferent that your head is ringing at the end.3. The dramaturgy is completely neglected. One destruction-scene follows the next; one pursuit-scene follows the next! And the end! What a big disaster: it's like in a video game, in an ego-shooter. It's so stupid. Almost propaganda for war.4. Then, Nolan will make this movie ""intelligent and complex"". Do you know M. Nolan that intellectual and deep does not mean emotionless and a confusing plot?5. Nolans idea to enter in the dream of somebody else is not so bad but the idea is not exhausted. Dreams are imagination, there are no rules, and they are bizarre and strange (Have you ever seen a film by David Lynch Mr. Nolan? That is like a dream.). So what all the guys with guns are doing there? Why are there always skyscrapers or a military base? That's stupid. There is NO IMAGINATION, your dreams are copies of real life and they are even WORSE than reality. The only good thing is the sequence with the train.6. To select a well actor like Michael Caine for saying two lines is just embarrassing and disrespectful. Mr. Nolan is capable of making great movies (Memento, The Prestige) but this one is very, very poor.Your movie is not ""complex, intelligent and deep"" but just superficial and an insult for the reasonably carefully viewer."
tt1853728,"I'm working my way through the top 250 movies on IMDb, and well.....there is no way this movie should be in that list.It's totally over-rated, and if the name Tarantino wasn't associated with it, maybe it wouldn't have been in that list.Whilst there are some great scenes and characterization (Shultz and Candie are awesome), the main character Django lacks any sort of personality. You would think that as a black slave who has suffered so much hardship, we would find something empathetic and endearing about him, but it's difficult to warm to him, and his character gets less and less likable in the second half of the movie. By the end, I actually saw him as the bad guy for mindlessly killing innocent folk simply because they were white. And no, I am not a white person myself.The ending is so over-the-top and clich√© it's laughable. The final scenes of his woman clapping him as he blows up the mansion, and does a little jiggly dance on the horse is something that might appeal to school aged kids, but seriously? What was Tarantino thinking? And to play modern hip-hop music whilst this is going on? I think by that time Tarantino had gotten so carried away, that he didn't even bother to make the movie's ending remotely realistic or believable."
tt0816692,"I saw this movie in an IMAX theater and I have to say, although it has amazing visuals and suspenseful music, I was disappointed. The story was engaging, I cared about the characters but it didn't touch me and it didn't amaze me.The visuals: Everything about them was breathtaking. The use of models and little CGI really impressed me and the camera angles were close to perfect. It seemed like everything was planned and planned again, kinda reminded me of a Kubrick style movie (somewhat like 2001) but more dynamic. All the space stuff was amazing and completely silent which added to the movie as a whole.The music: Now, I have a few problems with it. I didn't really like it because it seemed to repetitive. Usually, the soundtracks made by Hans Zimmer always impress me but this time the music felt too repetitive. Is was all like someone was beating a drum in my ear over and over again. Though it did add to the movie, I just didn't really care for it.The plot: Now, I'm gonna go into a bit of a spoiler zone, so if you haven't seen the movie I suggest you stop reading right about here. So, I usually have a rule that I tend to get mad when it gets broken and this rule is that when you make a sci fi movie you either go for the ""realistic"" future, in which the laws of physics and technology and everything about it is plausible, to some extent (like Gattaca, Moon etc.), or you make a future that is set in another world that has its own rules (like Star Wars, Star Trek etc.). You never mix the two, and if you do it's very hard to make it work. Interstellar doesn't really make it work really well. It starts of as a hard sci fi and near the end it turns into complete fantasy. From the moment Cooper enters the black hole the movie is ruined for me because the movie sets out to be believable and right at that moment becomes too much. I couldn't get over it. If it happened in another movie, or if the movie started out as the type of movie that throws this kind of ""fantasy"" things in your face I would've been okay with it, but when the whole point of the movie is to make it seem so real and possible and every little thing has science behind and that it and could happen in real life, when it tries so hard to make you think about it as a real world and tries to make you think about every detail in it the whole ending of the movie makes 0 sense. The ending really dropped the ball in my opinion.Overall, a great movie, stunning visuals, great, if a bit repetitive, music and a good story until the end. 8/10"
tt0372784,"Where Memento was psychologically deep and engulfing, Batman Begins is shallow and repetitive. Chris Nolan's breakout masterpiece Memento showed us that he could tell a story that keeps us riveted and constantly guessing through unique editing and story telling techniques. However, Batman Begins flowed poorly. I commend Nolan for not using the quick flashy editing techniques of directors like Guy Ritchie, but his more subdued style failed to engage me. The placement of the flashback sequences were jarring, and failed to move the plot forward in an interesting way.Unlike the Spiderman films, Nolan failed in creating sympathy for both the hero and the villains. The story is a classic battle between good and evil, but I found it too simple. The film attempted to engage us in a good dialog about the reasons for crime and corruption and how poverty is both a symptom and a cause of both. Unfortunately, it was grossly simplified for the sake of mass consumption. I do not believe this is Nolan's fault as I doubt he had final cut status for the film. In general, Hollywood underestimates the intelligence of the movie going public and tends to just throw explosions and nudity at them in place of good plot. Though there was no nudity in this film, I feel that this film did not fulfill it's full potential for the sake of more action. A good discussion about crime and evil would have given Bruce Wayne believable motivation for becoming Batman. The whole ""a burglar shot my parents"" motive could have been done better. I had a hard time empathizing with Bruce Wayne as a result.The acting in the film was as good as the dialog allowed. I always find Liam Neeson's acting rather poor, and this film was no exception. Neeson's character in this was only slightly different from that of his character in Star Wars Episode I. I found his character and the whole ""league of shadows"" very cheesy.In general I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
tt1853728,"It's not a bad film. The choice of music is terrible though. I don't usually write reviews. However, I felt the need to complain about the soundtrack. It just doesn't fit. It's out of touch with the story and it's background. It also has little in relationship with the overall feel of the picture. With only a few lyrics that relate to the story- line. I feel sick as a movie and music lover. Alfred Hitchcock will be rolling in his grave. Whoever thought it feasible to put this type of music in a western should of got four lashes with the whip. You need dramatic, moody and captivating scores. Tarantino... you should of better known better. On the other hand the acting was superb. It moved and captivated me and I often felt I wanted to reach into the screen and kill the slave-masters myself. Only to be thrown back to reality by the bad choice of songs. Err... pop songs? These songs will be outdated in a small number of years. Rendering the film mediocre and maybe forgotten by many. Where as it could of been a timeless gem. Absolutely abysmal. Some people may read this and agree with me. Where as others would say ""I bet he couldn't do better"". But I'm damn sure I could with ease. If I reviewed this movie as just a picture alone It would be at least an eight. If reviewed only on the music, then maybe a two star only."
tt0993846,I walked out of the theater not because of the profanity but because the characters were unsympathetic and the story was boring.
tt1345836,"Chris Nolan has r-e-a-l-l-y outdone himself again this time. An amazing story that I don't even know who else could write such a treatment on the World's Greatest Detective, the crowning glory of Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.I remember I once made a joke to myself a long while ago about him that if he was going to make another movie, he would probably cast Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's respective love interests from a movie of which they BOTH starred in and worked on-- 10 Things I Hate About You.It would be ironically funny how both actors are connected to each other from working at different times with the ""holy-moly mind-blowing"" filmmaker and that the actresses that played their love interests would possibly too as well."
tt0110912,"A pair of assassins in search of McGuffin, unclear what's inside but it's probably nothing, employed by Marcellus to recover his debts, in the course of their work, people lose their assets; one hitman's called Vincent who likes to shoot up, not just firearms but with needles close up, when out with the wife of the boss cuts it close, as she snorts all his gear and then goes overdose; a boxer called Butch throws a fight the wrong way, Marcellus sends Vince to reclaim the foul play, but events take a turn, there's a bit of a twist, as the boss and the boxer are caught in a tryst; a cleaner called Winston removes every trace, of all that remains when you're shot in the face, and a pair of till robbers with new openings, help Jules to consider, should he do other things."
tt0068646,"OK, I see that the movie has many naysayers. I was one of them when I saw the film in 1972, and I was only fifteen at the time. I could go on and on about the film's myriad failures. It is contrived, self-important, at times even poorly staged. Which brings me to my point. A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best Director-- Bob Fosse (for ""Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a much better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that ""Cabaret"" won.The other seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Editing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So when the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the Award goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two statues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay). How does any movie win eight Academy Awards and fail to grab Best Picture? With that in mind, ""The Godfather"" is not merely arrogant film-making. Its history and legacy,both--just like its protagonists-- are just downright larcenous."
tt0109830,"No matter what I say here, it won't matter. People see this movie as a classic, and I respect that. But despite the raving reviews, I was not in love with the concept; Forrest Gump is a ridiculous series of events, portrayed seriously.The accents, the outcomes, the behavior? Ridiculous. Yet its tonality is serious... Its message? Serious. Now, perhaps the humor was just a miss for me, and there is something comedically appealing to others, or perhaps celebrating mediocrity is truly that moving to some. But in neither case was this film redeemable for me.The pacing was slow, and to be honest I was a bit bored. But I sat through slow burns before, such as The Shawshank Redemption, and that was a far better movie. And with a much better message, plot and delivery.I feel like I'm desecrating someone's grave here, but I stand by it. I've witnessed much more compelling storylines, acting and cinematography than this. So, 5/10 for me, but I know my opinion is unpopular and most will think differently."
tt0816692,"This movie attempts to be serious and it has good believable science in it but then they do things that just make you want to scream at the writers. If you are going to ask me for suspension of disbelief please be a little consistent.A space ship takes off from earth boosted with a three stage rocket about the size of a Saturn 5 rocket. That same ship can then take off and reach orbit from two alien worlds with out any boosters, including one planet so far down a gravity well that there is a time dilation of one hour to 7 years. At one point three ships are moving away from a black hole with no thrust but when the smaller ships separate from the larger one they immediately fall back into the black hole. There is a 300 foot ocean swell on a planet where the ocean is only 1 foot deep.It seems like every time the writers wanted to add some plot device into the story they added a new convenient constraint to their universe. For example you can communicate normally in one direction through their worm hole but only a few bits per day in the other direction. Our hero is an ex-NASA pilot who even though hasn't been in contact with NASA for 20 years is given the task of piloting their latest ship.I hope anyone who took high school physics would feel insulted by this movie."
tt0372784,"Now, I'm no Batman expert, but I do know that the tale of him is supposed to be dark and serious. And if I'm correct, this movie certainly succeeded at emulating that feel. Sure, it isn't Star Wars Episode III, and the first Batman movies were certainly more fun (Batman Returns is still my favorite), although this movie probably was the first to accurately translate Batman to the big screen. Living up to my expectations from the trailers, I certainly recommend it to Batman fans.All in all, I give it a B. The movie ain't no Spider-man, but it was certainly no Hulk either (half exciting, half boring as hell). Christian Bale is definitely the Batman."
tt0120737,"...no, not the movie, but the response here. I can only hope that all of the fans of the books are projecting their love of the books onto what is at best a decent fantasy film and overall just better than average. How this got a top 5 ranking here is quite beyond my imagination.ATTENTION: Spoilers ahead.Now for those of you that say this is true to the book, I say fine but a movie has to stand on its own regardless of what it's based on, and here's what I saw when I watched it:The performances were decent at best. Our hero and his graybeard mentor seemed believable. Those performances were good if not outstanding. The balance of the cast fell into the acceptable ""along for the ride"" category or the almost hard to watch ""over the top"" group. Count the chief villain in the over the top group.The special effects were interesting but seemed to have reached beyond their grasp. Very few of the settings seemed real. For those book fans that would counter that they seemed true to the book, I again say fine, but they didn't appear real and to me that makes them poor. Well done effects should blend so seamlessly into the background that you can't tell them from the real thing by looking. For a setting, you should be wondering where they found that location, not saying ""hey, that's pretty cool computer graphics work"". The same goes for most of the FX characters - they just looked computer generated and to me that makes them poor even though they were interesting. They did a more realistic monster in Return of the Jedi almost two decades ago.Like nearly all three hour movies, it would have greatly benefited from being only a two hour movie. Additionally, (and again I don't really care if it's true to the book) the ending was simply horrible. I was actually startled when the credits started to roll. I've seen many movies that were only one part of a multi-part story, but each has been able to stand on its own. This story was incomplete and I simply can't imagine sitting through another 6 hours of this to finally get to the conclusion - the story just isn't compelling enough for that. One three hour movie that got all the way to the finish might have been acceptable, but not three of them.Finally, not to throw flames at those of you who loved these books, because maybe the movie wasn't completely true to them or maybe it was simply done much better in the book, but the story itself didn't seem all that well done either. We have these nine characters on a quest (at least one of whom was able to hop a ride on Big Bird for a while but apparently didn't think the same transport would work for this trip), at least three of them have no purpose but to get the others into trouble, and all of them together show no more camaraderie than the prima donnas at the last ""Divas Live"" show. A few of these characters are apparently pretty decent guys to have around in a fight given their ability to singlehandedly fight off literal swarms of blade wielding zombies, but frankly, I really didn't care who lived or died in this film (although I do admit I was sorry to see graybeard go down since his was the best performed part in the show).I really don't mean to rip too hard on this movie, it was an OK flick for the genre and I though it was somewhat enjoyable despite its length. But - how it managed to snare a nomination for the Best Picture Oscar or get a top 5 ranking here is completely unfathomable. Anyone describing this work as a ""masterpiece"", IMHO, really needs to get out more.I give it a 6 - just barely better than average."
tt0137523,"OK, normally I identify with punk movies, but this one just doesn't work out. It is an aimless odyssey into a void of aimless people that moves along without direction. PS - another reason to hate this film: I believe the trend towards male frontal nudity in film started with this POS. I hate this movie even more than Freddie Got Fingered, and that is hard to do. This movie was supposed to invoke some sort of anti-corporate, primal rage sort of message, but it just didn't work."
tt0114369,"I can point to se7en as an indicator as to what is wrong with American Film today. It is ultimately the work of cynics who, despite possessing a remarkble skill for handling the technological wonders that make up film craft, have absolutely no respect or affection for the audience.Se7en celebrates the destructive power of evil in its purest form.  Although the film contains fantastic cinematography and expert performances from the cast (especially Freeman), I sincerely wonder at the motivations behind Fincher and the rest of the creators of this ugly, pretentious and abusive picture. It absolutely wallows in filth, grime and blood. To director Fincher's credit, he has probably come the closest to capturing Bosch on film. If they (the filmmakers) are out to expose the sinful nature of the human being well guess what, most of us already know that- Fincher has us at hello if that is his focus. Much has been written about the twist at the ending. I'm sorry, this ending shows no respect for the audience and their sensiblities what so ever. It makes the two hours one has spent watching this film utterly wasted. Because the most articulate character in the film is the hidden killer (played by an absolutly incredible actor), I wonder if the film makers see themselves as spiritual blood brothers with the pyschopath. The film is dark, unrelenting and completely devoid of any joy, hope or resurrection. Pessimistic films can be extremely effective note The Seven Samurai, The Sergio Leone films, Dr. Strangelove and others, but those films had senses of  humour and balance to their pessimism. Again, I ask the motivations of the makers of this film: If you want me to feel dirty, raped and corrupted by the ""real"" world, I already am, I don't need to raped in the ""reel"" world by cynical opportunists wanting to make a buck off of the audience's already jaded spirits."
tt0468569,"It's a very soft 9, but it's a 9/10 for me.Directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer - these guys are in their primes here. Not that the same isn't true of some of the actors involved in this film, Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart.It's hard for me to do a review on this film and certainly the character of the late Heath Ledger is one of the greatest villains in cinema history. He is played to perfection. Perfect would even be putting it mildly. Ledger is so great in this film that all the awards and recognition he has received from around the world are too little.Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Gary Oldman are all super, but the one who shines brightest out of the entire cast with the exception of Ledger is Aaron Eckhart and his character, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Christopher Nolan's hidden ace. A perfect addition to the film's story.The action scenes are OK, the sound is good, the film is generally very good technically and is far from the most successful in the genre, but the acting, the pacing and the story itself make The Dark Knight (2008) the giant that it is.I recommend it along with the other two installments in the series, ""Batman Begins"" (2005), and the not-so-good ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012).Final score: 9/10."

tt0120737,"I watched this film the day before seeing Amelie, and the difference in films was astounding.  After the beginning, where the main character gets his ring, the rest of the film revolves around him surviving various attacks from various different creatures.I have no inclination to watch the second as I'm sure it'll be more creatures providing more attacks, with little real 'plot'As seems to be standard in big budget action films nowadays, there's the token ""funny"" character (the Welsh bloke) who is simply there to provide cheap laughs.I can't fathom how this is number 4 in the IMDB top 250."
tt0167260,"After finishing my 100th (give or take) time watching the entire trilogy I'd figured a review was long overdue. There are no words for what i feel about this trilogy. It's beyond anything i can explain. The closest word would be perfection, but that doesn't even do it justice.I was 11 when the first movie came out, and i fell in love with the franchise immediately. Everything i did revolved around the fantasy universe as this franchise was the first big thing i truly fell in love with. I have pictures of elves on my walls and dragon statues on my shelfs. I have Sting hanging on my wall and my key chain for my car keys is the One Ring. My wife has the evening star and she wore it at our wedding. Lord of the rings has made me to who i am today and i feel privileged to have such a masterpiece be created in my short span on this earth!I love Fellowship of the Ring and Two Towers, but Return of the King is the final piece that brings everything together. I'm usually a pretty tough guy, and i rarely get emotional but the last hour is hard for me to sit through without shedding a tear. No matter how many times i watch the franchise i always get emotional. ""My friends. You bow to no one!"" gets me every time!The last thing I'd like to ad is that i feel like I'm a part of the journey. I feel sorta empty after watching it. I feel like all of the hobbits when they come back home and drinks their first pints at The Green Dragon. It's one of the movies where i sit through the end credits and just think. This is a good thing. You know a movie is extraordinary if it makes you empty after you've watched it!"
tt0120815,"I knew going in and it being Spielberg that there wasn't going to be much variety, but wow there is almost none. Most of the movie is focused around of course ""saving"" Private Ryan. And yet it almost feels like the movie is more about how much Spielberg is at his old tricks. Most of the characters are one dimensional and hardly get any development other than Tom Hanks who is as always golden. The worst of them though is Matt Damon (he's Pvt. Ryan). He's stereotypically arrogant and seems like the type of guy who's all talk and no walk. It makes him pretty much impossible to like and leaves you with the desire to shut off the movie once he's on the screen. As for the story, what story? Most of what should be story is hampered by more arguing and attempts at comedic, more lighthearted moments. In the middle of war? Really? And the film being nearly 3 hours feels so padded and stretched out that it's like watching a 90 minute movie in slow motion. So if you want my advice, skip this and rent Full Metal Jacket."
tt1345836,"I sat through 3 hours of this film last night and just could not believe how boring it was, and how it just was not any fun at all. Very little action, lots of brooding and the most boring Batman villain ever. Bane is a third rate Darth Vader, and his voice-over is mixed way too high; plus there is no motivation I could see for what he was doing.My 14 year old daughter was so bored also that she kept asking me when it was going to be over. I personally think this film is an early leader for this year's Razzies. Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Acting, and Worst Editing are some of the potential ""honors"" that immediately come to mind."
tt0361748,"Inglorious Basterds; Tarantino grandeur and glory at its peakThe end credits of the film kick in following the line ""I think it just be might masterpiece"" by Brad Pitt (I'm sure there's a separate fan following for the end credits as well) and pretty much sums up the magnanimous piece of cinema by the legendary Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino,the undisputed monarch of non linear narratives, goes all guns blazing in his alternate-history depiction of the Nazi brutality and the eventual downfall of Hitler. The film revolves around the bloody and gruesome 'Inglorious Basterds', a group of Jewish Americans vowed to decimate as many Nazi soldiers as possible and act as a harbinger of Jewish liberation. Col. Hans Landa brilliantly portrayed by Christoph Waltz is a narcissistic and callous general in the ranks of the German military in German occupied France region where he's known as the ""jew-hunter"",is the textbook definition of movie villians and perhaps widely regarded as one of the finest villians ever to have graced the silver screen. With an astounding command over French,German, English and Italian, Christoph Waltz shoulders an aura of hostility and unpredictability and brings in a wave of energy to the character of Landa. He truly deserves the Oscar.In terms of the writing and characterisation, Tarantino is at his belligerent best with extended scenes of intriguing dialogues, grotesque depictions of violence and an enviable cinematography and music composition. Every second of the narrative gets the audience glued to their screens and appreciate the Tarantino signature style film making. Inglorious Basterds is definitely not for the faint of hearts and those who detest violence in any form. One can't help but notice Tarantino's appetite for violence and storytelling is insatiable."
tt0993846,"If you've seen The Goodfellas or Casino, then you'll know the story of The Wolf of Wall Street. This is another tale of a criminal whose ambitions sweep him away into a debauched world of dirty money, out-of-control substance abuse, endless lies, a troubled family life, and a downward spiral of corruption that inevitably leads to his own undoing. Only thing is, this is less about the gangsters and mafia, and more about white-collar crime. The guys wear suits, work in proper offices, and everything they do is just business; funnily enough, this whole movie still plays out like a kind of gangster film.Based on the memoirs of Jordan Belfort - the real-life stock broker who made millions by selling shoddy stocks to average joes - the film showcases one seriously messed-up slimeball of a man. If his scheme sounds familiar, it's because it's been the inspiration behind the 2000 film Boiler Room, and this film covers much of the same concepts, albeit with better structure. The film maintains a close and intimate focus on the man as he rises to power, suckers thousands into his schemes, and then lives a life of extreme excess. And it is extreme: the whole film becomes laden with drugs, sex, superficial luxuries, material things, and characters who want nothing more than to take and consume everything. The sheer corruption becomes palpable on-screen, and I couldn't help but to shake my head at numerous scenes when I saw just how far these wolfish characters have gone in their unrestrained partying and debauchery. I have no clue as to how closely this film adapts the real-life events, but at times it's almost hard to believe that things could have gone this far. And yet, the excesses serve to underscore key themes and criticisms on the American dream; the pursuit of money and success, through any means, remains the main drive of the characters and the movie, and it leads to a fairly hard-hitting downfall.This film features good-looking photography and editing. Acting is great: Leonardo DiCaprio is practically perfect as the titular character, and the rest of the cast pulls their weight really well (including Jonah Hill, who seems to fit into his character's archetype very comfortably). Writing is really sharp and good; the film is full of great lines and great speeches. There are some great-looking sets, props, and costumes on display in this film. Music has a varied mix of songs, and they're all used really well for their intended effect.The Wolf of Wall Street is every bit as good as Martin Scorsese's previous work with The Goodfellas and Casino. All these films work with similar plots and themes, but TWOWS is like a gangster film masked by the thin veil of upper-class corporate swindling. It is a film that candidly shows the crimes and excesses in full, before proving that, even for the super-rich, crime still doesn't pay.Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)"
tt0120815,"I'm starting to think that everything that Speilberg touches turns to gold. This is probably considered one of the greatest movies of all time and it is directed by Speilberg. The movie is incredable. The beginning was horrifying. I couldn't believe how accurate it was and painful it was to watch. When I studied WW2 in high school, I thought no one could ever re-create the Beach of Normady. But Speilberg did. I felt like I was there with the soldiers. I felt their fear, pride, and love for their country. I couldn't believe how much dedication our armies put into fighting and winning the war. And whenever I go to visit Washington D.C., I have more American pride then ever. I am more than proud to give this movie a10/10"
tt0167261,"From the beginning to the very end, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is interesting and enjoyable. The books and the movies alike grasp one's attention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sense the pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is truly powerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has something the first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two great islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be described. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. The third movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made."
tt0109830,"Based on the 1986 novel by Winston Groom of the same name; Forrest Gump is about a simple man, named Forrest (Tom Hanks) whom with a low I.Q. who goes through life, accidentally being present at many historic moments, while building success for himself, however, never getting with his true love, Jenny Curran (Robin Wright) which mostly seems to be the only thing, that is eluding him. Without spoiling the movie, too much, this feel-good, financial blockbuster was indeed one of my favorite movies from the 1990s. I still quote, act out, & rewatch this movie, even with the downer tragic ending, this film has. I just can't help, loving it, despite the film changing a lot from the source material, like Gump's core personality and size. I kinda like that, he's not an autistic savant. In my opinion, it would be, too jarring. It would be, really too odd and unrealistic to see him, play chess, while being an astronaut, while people still thinking that he's an idiot. I kinda like that the film primarily focuses on the first eleven chapters of the novel, before skipping ahead to the end of the book. The middle part of the book is truly outrageous with Gump fighting off, cannibals, and becoming a pro-wrestler. That was way too out there to be taken seriously! The careers, he got in the film, seems more grounded with the reality of his character and the story. In addition to skipping some parts of the novel, the film adds several aspects to Gump's life that do not occur in the novel, such as his needing leg braces as a child and his run across the United States. Those changes really did help the film, a lot. This movie was also well shot by Robert Zemeckis. It made great use of its locations. I also love the use of CGI techniques to make it look like Tom Hanks was in some of the archive footage with various historical figures. Most of the visual effects in this film were pretty impressing at the time. Yet, I just wish the voice-dubbing was a little better. It doesn't really match well, with the movement of the long-dead historical figure's lips! While, the movie does have a lot of profanity, sex/nudity, drug use and violence for a PG-13. I think it somewhat works with the rebellions style of the 1960s. I also dig the film soundtrack. Great use of many well-known artists of the 1950s & 1960s. It's really does fit with that era of time. Also, the original music that Alan Silvestri made for the film was also beautiful. It fits some well in the film. Not only did that work, but the acting was outstanding. Tom Hanks was amazing as the title character. In other hands, this dim-witted, guileless, Southern-drawling simpleton hero could had turn into a bumbling yet annoying unlikeable offensive mental retarded stereotype. Instead, Hanks makes the fictional character, Gump seem like a real person with real motives and feelings. He really did deserve the Oscar, despite what some critics make say about his performance. Even the supporting cast was well-done. I love all of the characters ranging from 'Bubba' Blue (Mykelti Williamson) to Mrs. Gump (Sally Fields). I even kinda like Jenny, even when the writers made her, somewhat a horrible selfish trouble-person, who leaves Gump with a kid that grew up to be Haley Joan Osment in one of his first movie roles. Then- who can ever forget, Lt. Dan Taylor? This was Gary Sinise finest role. The character development that they gave him, was heart-breaking, yet hopeful. I love his redemption story. The film has this 'ignorance is bliss' philosophy to it; that makes the movie, fun to watch. The satire on contemporary values, during America's mid-20th century accomplishments is truly funny. The historic 'zelig' style jokes are mostly a hit than a miss to the funny. I also like how ambiguous, Forrest's story, as some people believe that he might be an unreliable narrator who whitewashing American history. Yet, I don't think, it's as racist or sexist as some people think, it is. The film is a lot more positive than that. Forrest is a represented of what is innocence and good about the world. He has this, out right decency about himself. He helps his friends if they're in need, even if some of them, take advanced of his hospitality. Forrest Gump is also a surprisingly spiritual story, well-told. A lot of people has stated out, the relationship between Forrest and Jenny echoes the relationship of Hosea and Gomer in the Old Testament; which in return is about, the relationship between God and man. Hints, the white feather that floats through Forrest's life. The movie is about the question of whether we are masters of our own fate or on a path to a predetermined destiny. Another thing, interesting, is how some people has been noted to see some political interpretations which I kinda have to disagree with. While, it seem like Gump follows a very conservative lifestyle, Jenny's life is full of counter-cultural embrace, complete with drug usage, promiscuity, and antiwar rallies, and that their eventual marriage might be a kind of reconciliation between America's extremes political points; I agree with Hanks, the film was non-political and non-judgmental. Forrest Gump isn't about liberal or conservative values. It's about learning to live with your limitations, while also giving it, everything you got. About the film winning best picture in 1994 over films like 'The Shawshank Redemption' & 'Pulp Fiction', I think the movie deserve it. While, on the surface, those other two films look superior better and more mature. In true, 'Forrest Gump' has just as much to give as those films. Also, it's by far, the more entertaining film of the three. Overall: Forrest Gump is like a box of chocolates. It's super sweet."
tt7286456,"The hype the movie generated did absolutely injustice to the film.
The actor did a pretty good job but the screenplay and story is too much boring. The first half its bearable but the last half really let down the film entirely. One of the worst films ever to get such a huge IMDB ratings ever.Wasted my 2 hours completely."
tt1130884,"I give this four stars because hey, the performances were well done and the cinematography was just lovely, I'm sure most fans of the film can agree on that.Unfortunately, it was otherwise very disappointing. I read so many rave reviews and everybody told me that I had to see this movie, the ending was wild and I'd never ever guess what it was and all that. Sadly, within the first five minutes I realized it was just an updated version of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, announced that DiCaprio was insane and all that, and infuriated my friends.I do understand and respect why many people adore Shutter Island. My opinion may be different because I saw Caligari first or it may be because I'm a fan of silent films, but whatever the reason, I find the original more exciting to view."
tt0993846,"The legendary director has made his most playfully rambunctious and funniest film ever. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Jordan, an ambitious stockbroker who learns all too well from his coke-snorting mentor that the trick to the business is making your own money from commissions.Jordan sets off on his own hawking penny stocks, and quickly figures out that -- because the commission rate is so much higher on them. He can quickly amass a personal fortune by following storyline."
tt0409594,"The only show I have watched since 90210! Why did they discontinue it? It was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and made you feel like you are a part of it all! The least they should do is release it on DVD!I checked out similar shows, but nothing has come close. The cast had incredible chemistry and I looked forward to each episode with much anticipation.They made a big mistake by pulling that show. If anyone has any info regarding where I can obtain a DVD of North Shore please post a few lines here. Thanks! Aloha!"
tt1130884,"I, like many others, was fascinated by, loved, and watched this film several times when it was released, trying to make up my own mind and never being quite sure. I've come back to it a few years later, looking deeper than was perhaps intended, and now it feels like a masterpiece!"
tt0133093,A little bit too dark and confusing in my opinion but I can see why so many people like it. The sci fi is spot on and the story is truly one of a special kind. However I found the movie a little bit boring and if you're not into action this one is not for you.
tt0361748,"I was a bit surprised because i watched it without watching any trailers or anything and the rating says it all, the movie was very unpredictable and enjoyable, the movie gets a little bit slow in the 3rd 'chapter' but it gains its suspense quickly."
tt0313792,"For once a Woods Allen film where he isn't the main character.  True, he did not star in 1998's ""Celebrity"" either, but Kenneth Branaugh did do a Woody Allen impression for 113 minutes.  This film was much less indulgent for Allen who only appears as the comic relief in a supporting role.  Jason Biggs does a tremendous job in the leading role of the 'love blinded male' often found in Allen films, however, in this film he is likable and relatable to people who aren't neurotic.  Ricci does a fantastic job in the role of the out-of-her-head girlfriend, and DeVito's acting as the desperate manager for Biggs is truly one of the best written and acted minor roles in quite some time.  Jimmy Fallon's understated cameo exemplifies why this movie works so well while many of Allen's recent films haven't - less is more.  This is a fun film to watch on your own or on a date."
tt1375666,"This movie never gets old! Of Christopher Nolan's movies, it is the one i have watched the most outside of The Dark Knight! This really feels like a movie that only he could make! A mind bogling mix of ideas and creativity, as the concept of dreams are told to the viewer in a way, so that it never becomes too much! This is one of those movies that hooks you from beginning to end!The plot is engaging and you never know what to expect as the movie builds up and becomes more and more intense and thrilling! This is also a journey of guilt, confronting yourselves and learning to move on! Directing is amazing with some truelly iconic scenes such as the hallway fight which is expertly made and filmed! Soundtrack is equally great and iconic!Great actors who all does a great job! Lots of talent! The ending still remains one of my favorite movie endings of all time! This is a once in a lifetime experience that you dont wanna miss!"
tt0167261,"Very loosely inspired by the source material. It's mostly Peter Jackson dragging the story out so that he could neuter the entire Lord of the Rings story by leaving out The Scouring of the Shire.Let's make the ents say no, then reconsider. Let's randomly have a love story tangent so we can see Liv Tyler pout some more. Let's have Faramir be a carbon copy of Boramir and take Frodo back to Osgiliath. 30+ minutes of completely wasted time that kills the pacing all for Peter Jackson to prove, in the end, he didn't understand Tolkien's books."
tt0110912,"Save all the sophisticated Yada, Yada, Yada, and all the smart Blah, Blah, Blah. I watched it 3 times trying my best to like it, though it failed big time to leave any effect but disgust, silliness, and provocative absurdity; and maybe that's Quentin Tarantino's original dream! It is the ultimate boring nonsense, and it's proud of itself too. OH MY GOD, how did Tarantino manage to persuade all of these stars to do it in the first place, I swear this is a mystery for me!Though, at certain corner in my mind, I have to ""respect"" its script somehow, because its unusual structure, and revolutionary sense. It succeeded in being a cheap novel which has been published cheaply in not well-ordered pages. It left its clear mark on all the crime movies later, with some followers that range between ugly and uglier. And still it's the most artistic movie made by Tarantino to date. WAW, I can be objective to surprising extent!But, in the same time, this movie is as dull as Harvey Keitel's face, as meaningless as Bruce Willis' role, and as unfunny as Uma Thurman is. It's wholly non-enjoyable, highly sickening, and a special torture to watch. I ranked it in my list of the worst 10 movies I've have ever seen, which makes me the biggest misfit among all the mad fans of it. It's the forever tragedy of being alone among a group that loves the usual: (2001: A Space Odyssey), (The Godfather: Part II), (Chinatown), etc.. as if loving them makes you a well cultured movie buff, and a venerable thoughtful brain! But you know what? I don't love them at all. I love (Die Hard), (The Guns of Navarone), and (The Boy Who Could Fly), and that doesn't make me trivial or ignorant, it just makes me someone with a different taste (or - sometimes - a taste!).Huh? It won the Oscar, So what? Some people gather yearly, at the Oscars or else, to select the fine movie from THEIR point of view, and simply this one isn't fine from MY point of view. I may care about its novelty, but I won't give a hoot about its characters, atmosphere, or world. Any movie that has Christopher Walken narrating such a nauseating story about some watch in some war--is definitely not for me WHATEVER THE GREAT MEANING BEHIND THAT ANYWAY! Even the plot, yes it's different and inspiring, but not brilliantly used. Its final result was something too ridiculous and cold. It's anti-formulaic, yet produced a sleepy doped up crime movie. It's not the case of style overwhelmed narration, it's a case of style killed narration (if there was any!), to show off what looked eventually like oddity for oddity.After so many movies by Tarantino, it's official: the man is a master of nonsense, who's so educated when it comes to the internationally cinematic nonsense history, and so creative in producing lots and lots of highly manufactured nonsense. However, sometimes he makes movies about uninteresting people by uninteresting ways, recycling the old nonsense into new forms, making it perfectly interesting for anyone but me. I don't hate Tarantino, but I hate Tarantino's (Pulp Fiction). Sorry, not my kind of nonsense."
tt7286456,It was a really slow paced and boring. It was too overhyped in my opinion.
tt0110912,"I tried to complete it many times and i just can't. It's too boring and the silence between every word and the next is too long, most of the film with no dialogues that effect or support the story.The characters don't have any true connection to eachother or to the viwer they just meets eachother because the writer want that , the blood is over and have no logic also the movie just goes without clear directions no drama no massages not even true fire guns and gangs work, its just characters moving with some
shooting and a lot of blood.Seriously bad color grading and camera movements, i didn't feel in touch with any character or scene except the first 20-30 minutes."
tt0172495,"Gladiator"" is an epic masterpiece that captivates from start to finish. Set against the backdrop of ancient Rome, Ridley Scott's magnum opus immerses viewers in a world of political intrigue, betrayal, and the quest for justice.I've seen this movie for 5 times and don't mind to watch it again. Russell Crowe delivers a tour de force performance as Maximus, a general turned gladiator seeking vengeance against the corrupt emperor who murdered his family and betrayed him.With its compelling characters, powerful themes of honor and redemption, and iconic moments that linger long after the credits roll, ""Gladiator"" stands as a timeless classic and a testament to the enduring power of cinema. 10/10."
tt0109830,"A great movie, its great story and the story of Lieutenant Dan was sad, but I think it does not deserve the Academy Award for Best Film. I really enjoyed watching the movie and hated the character of Jenny."
tt0114369,"Oh my god! Current rating 8.7 and # 28 on top 250 list...!! I think many of IMDb users have gone out of their mind to vote 10, 9 & 8 to such a ridiculous crap.Yes, it is a fact that i do believe in the voting system of IMDb and it is absolutely true that i consult the reviews of this site before watching most of the films. In 95% of cases my judgment gone true. On the basis of rating and reviews i got disappointed only with two films. One is Se7en and the other is Once upon a time in the West (1968).Some of the IMDb users are also claiming Se7en to be the best work of David Fincher till date. But i don't think so... Fight Club (1999) is the best work of Fincher till date. It doesn't matter to me what others think about this review of mine but this is not a classic to be rated so high.""The god inspired and ordered a person to eliminate those 7 people who are indulging themselves to the 7 deadly sins of the universe."" I do admire the insane attitude of the killer but the plot and the entire story was full of flaws. Like in most of the psychological thrillers here also the lead actors failed to read and analyze the mind of the killer. In every crime committed by the killer... he stayed two steps ahead of the detectives. And yes the climax itself was one of the worst i have ever seen.Watch it only if you are a strong fan of crime thrillers otherwise not! Self - interpretation by the viewer after watching the film is the most important thing... 4/10....I can't vote it more than that.."

tt0468569,"This is starting to be downright ludicrous. Another naked king makes it to the top of the charts, helped by massive publicity.This is just another generic action blockbuster, based on tired clich√©s. It's not different from, say, those old Schwartzenegger movies: it's just updated for current trends and mass appeal: more effects, more speed, more violence, more noise, more music, just more of everything (except the intelligent stuff of course).The whole thing takes itself so seriously, and even pretends to bring some, er.. philosophical insight (sic) to the mix. Yeah, right. You end with a product that is not only mediocre, but aggressively and arrogantly so at that!Yes, Ledger's acting is a treat. And there's even a ~30 sec. good scene halfway through the movie. Er... That's about it.""Overrated'"" doesn't even start describing the irrational hype around this formulaic and forgettable action flick for teenagers."
tt0102926,"Everyone remembers Anthony Hopkins' delicious take on an epicurean monster and they should since its good enough to hold the whole the movie, near enough...But asides from these startlingly well written little monologues it's remarkable what a bland movie this otherwise is. I have an issue with any narrative that at its centre just follows law enforcement tracking down a killer. It leaves very little room for any meaningful development of either the plot or the characters, no matter what the details of the case, it always treads a familiar path. A big part of a story for me is what motivates the main character but with these kinds of things the answer is ""it's their job"" and Jodie Foster laying on the Saccharine about a bunch of farm animals only strikes me as a contrived way to humanize a basic, taciturn character type.The movie is obsessed with suggesting there is some type of spiritual connection between Hannibal and Clarice, but it is entirely an informed attribute.
The whole murder at its centre just feels like an arbitrary McGuffin as an excuse to get Anthony Hopkins out, so I guess I can't blame it."
tt0120815,"This movie begins and ends in a very lame fashion. Old people, American flags and shonky acting features heavily. Gratuitous.The subsequent half an hour (the landing scene) by itself would have made a better movie. What is the message this movie is trying to convey? That war is Hell? If so, then extend the landing scene to an hour, finish the movie there and preven the Hellish aspect spilling over into cinematic experience.The rest is just boring attempts at moralising, cliched moments and other embarrassing moments that just diminish the impact of the opening battle scene until it becomes a distant memory and you find yourself watching yet another formulaic war movie."
tt0848228,"This movie was simply 6 letter's in 1 word, ""Boring"". Why you may ask? Well, it's best to start from the beginning.I was expecting a great movie featuring several different superhero in 1 screen, I was so hyped that I got as many friends as I can to see it but some couldn't go so I only invited a few. God the movie was so hyped that there was a huge line and I mean huge and all of those people were gonna go see the same film that I was gonna see. So once I walked in and waited for almost 20 minutes for the movie to start, that is when the big disappointment began. Such a boring introduction and lame character revilement. No creativity, no second thought, no built up, nothing. Feels more like an introduction to Jersey Shore and Transformers than an actual Marvel Film. But I got to admit, the begging scene where Thor's brother appears reminds me of halo (atleast the first one) so that's pretty cool but too bad the scene itself sucked no matter what. The other negatives that made this film a disappointment is the lack of any real character imitations. Thor brother was the prime example of this along with the childish predictable jokes you hear from them. The acting and written for Thor's brother was pathetic and pointless that without he's mighty powers he's nothing but a wimp or the actor himself was just a wimp from the beginning. He looks to be about 50 years old and doesn't resemble any appears of Thor what's so ever, all they do is just put on the costume and that's it. So what about the clich√©d jokes I mentioned? Well, there stupid, childish, out of place for a movie that is suppose to be quality entertainment (then again it was terrible and nothing new) and once you hear the first joke, you will automatically know that all the jokes will be the same kind of thing threw out the whole movie. I will admit that I did laugh at some moments but it struck me to be unpleasant and very lazy for a movie like this or any other. In fact, I was so bored and unpleased that I wanted to leave right when black widow appears cause it was so boring. But I didn't cause I wouldn't want to hurt my friends's feeling's that I invited them to a movie and wanted to leave once we began watching it. So I stayed and watched the rest of the movie. It took about half of the movie just so all of heroes can appear and an interesting note I might add is that Edward Norton who played as Bruce Banner in the incredible hulk (2008) was replaced when I was expecting him to be in it. So I was disappointed with that cause he was great as Bruce Banner. The ending climates with the avengers and Thor's Brother was lame as well. Sure some of the action is cool but some other action scence suck and it used special/sound effects from transformers and that sucks. When I think of action from the avengers I would predict it to be Dragon Ball Z without energy waves or teleportation. But no it just felt dull. So, what I did I really think of the movie overall? Well, to put it short and bluntly this is what I said in my mind when the movie ended ""THIS MOVIE SUCKED!!! WHAT A SETUP FROM MARVEL TO DISGRACE SUCH HEROES THAT WERE GOOD TILL THIS MOVIE CAME OUT! MARVEL MUST OF KNEW THAT A WHOLE BUNCH OF MARVEL FANBOYS WERE GONNA GO SEE THIS MOVIE CAUSE IT HAD THEIR FAVORITE HEROES IN ONE BIG SCREEN! NOT A SECOND THOUGHT ON HOW IT WILL PLAY OUT, ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS WHO'S IN IT?! Wow, what a waste of money and time I wasted on such a worthless movie like this. FIRST THEY RUINED SPIDERMAN AND NOW THIS?! WHAT A SETUP!."" That's how I really felt like when I finished watching this movie. And you want to know what was the saddest part about it is?! A bunch of people said it was amazing and the best movie of the year! B******! Worst movie of the year you mean! And worst super hero movie I've ever seen in general. I recommend you all take my advice and don't waste your time on such dread cause it's not worth it. Don't Listen to what to the people who liked this movie cause they're only saying it cause there just so depended on Marvel that they think anything with their superhero will be good. At this point and on I don't really like Marvel at all anymore. The Avengers ruined it for me. Time to official move on to DC like everyone else would do. And the ones who haven't, wake up and see reality that your pointless Marvel Heroes are Zeros. My god this movie was so Bad when I think about it I feel embarrassed that I sat down and really watched the whole movie and didn't leave right when I felt like going to sleep like everyone else would. But I give this movie a 3/10 just because the beginning reminded me of Halo. But besides that the movie itself was so incredible boring and very unoriginal, don't forget it was predictable too. In fact when I was watching half of the movie I completely forget what the plot was really about. Another thing is that the movie feels more like a sequel to Thor than actual teamed up superhero movie. So, don't see The Avengers but go watch The Dark Knight Rises instead. That was a far better movie than The Avengers. Thanks for reading and I hope you take my advice. Good Bye, Your gonna need it."
tt0068646,"I have attempted to get through this film on 4 separate occasions. All I hear are good things and how it's the best of the best. However, I can't get through it. There is a wedding scene that seems to go forever and I just don't care. This may well be peak of filmmaking but I just don't see it."
tt0848228,"Ever since the beginning of the film, I was so amazed and happy That I was at the premier of the movie. Very good acting from all the main characters and good acting from the rest. Great Directing and writing from Joss Whedon too. The cinematography was stunning throughout the whole film.This is a fun action packed film for the whole family to enjoy just like the rest of the Marvel movies but better. The special effects by far are the best for any Marvel movie. The Hulk Looks so much more real. By the way The Hulk made the movie even better. Also, DO NOT SEE THE AVENGERS IN 3D! See the film because you will not be disappointed even if you are not that interested into superhero movies. It has a lot of humor and love, so again SEE IT!"
tt0816692,"Christopher Nolan seems to draw a buzzing mass of Nolan-fanatics wherever he goes. These little buzzers swarm around The Light That Is Nolan and in His light, nothing can ever go wrong. Who cares if Bane's death in The Dark Knight Rises was ridiculous? It's Nolan, he's amazing, God sent his cute little pout to earth to bless our sorry asses, and have you seen his¬Ö¬Ö (Aaaaand here we wander into dangerous territory.)Okay I get it, Memento was ingenious, The Dark Knight set new standards for the superhero-scope of the cinema-verse, but Nolan sure doesn't have the Midas hand of movie-making. He's a man, he makes mistakes, and not all of the stuff he makes turns out so fabulous.Hence the reason for the lame pun of this post: Nolan's latest film, Interstellar, wasn't as stellar as the name suggests.Sure, Interstellar has fancy technology, as its Oscar for Best Visual Effects will demonstrate. The most accurate portrayal of a wormhole, precision of orbital physics and astrophysics, (insert fancy jargon here)All that's great, except that there's more to a movie than just technical splendor.Stanley Kubrick's science fiction masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey isn't considered one of the greatest sci-fi films ever created only for its revolutionary techniques in portraying space and spaceships; its profound ruminations of the nature of man and the questions it raises on the divide between natural and artificial intelligence are what has put the film on the pinnacle of cinema. Of course, the movie's amazing sequences of spaceships moving slowly in harmony with Strauss's majestic pieces cannot be overlooked, but that does not mean they are the sole reason behind A Space Odyssey's critical acclaim.Interstellar tries valiantly to mimic both the technical and philosophical marvels of historical sci-fi films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, yet it fails by a long shot in delivering a significant, poignant message. The early scenes between Murph and Cooper fall flat in emotion; neither the acting nor the dialog carry through the fragile emotions that should have been exchanged in such a scene. Nolan's efforts to raise questions on the ""human identity"" are easily spotted in scenes that seem almost forced, with little contextual connection to the sequence of events that move the story forward. The best example would be Anne Hathaway's excruciatingly cringe-worthy scene in which she claims love is worth jeopardizing their whole mission and the future of humanity for. Seriously, this comes out of nowhere‚Äîwhen did Hathaway's character become so irrational and obsessed with her probably long-dead lover?""Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends time and space,"" she cries. Sound like something from one of those turn-your-life-around-through-these-10-steps books? It's unbelievably sloppy and unrealistic dialogue, and something I'm not at all surprised to find in a Nolan movie. Self-important, philosophic textbook quotes may work in a superhero movie where the hero is expected to be somewhat presumptuous, but not so much for a supposedly realistic science fiction flick.What I've concluded is that Interstellar is neither unique nor special; its ideas of travel through wormholes and warped time in different areas of the galaxy have already been entertained in science fiction films of an earlier age such as Star Trek. The only factor that Interstellar can show off above all other is the accuracy to which it incorporated modern theories of space and time‚Äî the wormhole's curved surface is supposedly the most accurate representation of such a thing ever put on screen.Perhaps the supposed scientific genius of the movie becomes more real to its audience because of the background of the movie, or the way the subject of space travel is treated. Science fiction movies like Star Trek seem far off from reality‚Äîsuch movies portray themselves as fiction, a made up world, a world that is usually beyond the parameters of a ""what if"" world that diverges from our own. Interstellar, however, tries to make itself seem like an extension of the reality we live in‚Äîour future very well may have in store for us a dry, bleak land that has forsaken the human race. Dying potato fields and giant dust storm seem less childlike, less like a figment of our imagination than do light sabers and evil warlords waging war on the galaxy. We are led to empathize with the world of Interstellar as if it were our own and not a created fantasy land, which is why some of the things that happen in the movie seem less absurd than what happens in other films of the same genre (of course, these ""things"" exclude the infamous bookshelf and Morse code scene, the absolute bane of the movie and the epitome of Christopher Nolan's over-ambition with his newest project).So if you thought Interstellar was an absolute blast, good for you. Congratulations for spending those extra dollars on watching IMAX 3D or whatever it is they have these days. Next time though, you might want to consider crashing on your couch with a nice, homemade bowl of buttery popcorn and let Netflix lead you through the world of true, time-proved science fiction. (Of course, Interstellar re-runs are always available. Respect personal preference I must.)"
tt0172495,"This movie is amazing, every soul should see this, Russell Crowe deserved the Oscar"
tt0172495,"An intense Roman epic, a la ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Spartacus,"" it was nice to see something like this made again. It had been since the 1960s that we had seen a 3-hour extravaganza like this.Like Ben-Hur, this is a story of a successful man who loses everything thanks to an evil man, and then has to fight his way back up to seek revenge on that man and to obtain his freedom back. It's a tried-and-true formula. This movie doesn't go to excess on the violence as some of the other more recent epic films did, such as ""Braveheart"" or ""The Patriot.""The acting is excellent, beginning with Russell Crowe, who has established himself as one of the best actors of today. Joaquin Phoenix also put himself ""on the map"" as an actor with his portrayal of the evil ""Commodus."" He's so annoying you want to slap that sucker, which means he's doing a good job acting. Kudos to the rest of the cast, too.Too bad they don't make more of these type of films, as they did in the 1950s and 1960s."
tt1345836,"I did not like how this was the most sentimental of the three Nolan Batman-movies. I prefer when the emotional aspects are more subtle, letting the audience draw its own conclusions about the characters feeling given their circumstances and back-stories. In The Dark Knight I felt the director trusted his audience more to understand Wayne's reactions after having heavily emphasized his childhood in Batman Begins. Whereas in The Dark Knight Rises it was much dwelled upon and fed to us with sentimental music. This made the first part of the movie a bit dreary, but it quickly became more enthralling and kept getting better as the story progressed. The acting was impeccable as were the visuals. I admit to having prejudices against superhero-movies, but the characters are complex and interesting. So was the plot, though it is clearly made to appeal to a mass-audience. There is nothing wrong with being popular and I did not waste my time watching these three movies."
tt0372784,"So,it's an all new original Batman film? HA! this film can't even get past the opening credits without ""borrowing"" from the other Batfilms! The Warner Brothers Logo morphs ,just like all 4 previous films.What else have we seen before?Batman pulls up criminal by lapels: ""What are you?""""I'm BATMAN!"" Hmm... didn't we see that in BATMAN?Batman standing on pillar among Gotham's skyscrapers as heroic music swells...add a Batsignal behind him...and yep..already done in BATMAN.Batman knows KungFu? See BATMAN & BATMAN RETURNS.Bruce falls through a hole and finds the BatCave... wasn't that in BATMAN FOREVER? Bats frighten Bruce into becoming Batman...also part of BATMAN FOREVER!Batman hands his secret identity over on a silver platter? See all 4 previous BatFilms.(This only worked as a plot point in BATMAN RETURNS!)""Batman Begins"" wastes about an hour telling you he's a secret KungFu expert. And wastes even more time trying to make Duchard & Ra's Al Ghul the same man.(Why does Liam Neeson claim he's Ghul?). Speaking of Ra's,he should have been of Arabic origins,not a feudal Japanese warlord.Ken Watanabe is a fine actor but Arnold Vosloo would have been THE Ra's Al Ghul.And speaking of Ra's,where is his daughter Talia? She was a MAJOR Batplot character as she was obsessed with Batman! (Would've made a better female lead character!)Why not give us more story by advancing the film,and logging the previous four ""as read""? (i.e.: Batman is a superhero,destroying villainy,knows all sorts of fighting techniques,has cool toys,do not mess with him. Need we know anything more?)If you read the comics,BATMAN became a bat not out of HIS fear,but the fear bats give others. He does not find the cave as a child.(Stupidly drilled into us in two films now.).Much as I love Michael Caine...sorry,Alfred is NOT a Cockney. Gary Oldman looks right as James Gordon,but it's a thankless role.Morgan Freedman is relegated to Alfred#2,as they basically take most of the meat from Lucius Fox's character.(He's a shrewed Wayne Business exec.,not a technological errand boy.).The Scarecrow is reduced to a 2nd class villain,only slightly better than the crummy version they did of BANE! Where is The Scarecrow's scarecrow outfit? (Oh,right...we're trying to look ""cool"").Cillian Murphy makes a cool Dr.Crane,but he isn't given enough screen time!What did the film get right? Well,Joe Chill DID kill the Waynes in the original story. Carmine Falcone is/was the head of Gotham's mafia. Mr.Zsz does carve a notch in himself for every murder he commits. That's about it.And how does this disaster end? By suggesting their next NEW idea:The Joker!(Rumour of Two-Face is also in the works.). Let's erase this film from your memory,and imagine a Batman vs. Scarecrow directed by Tim Burton and starring Michael Keaton...we'll forget all about those other three BatFlops."
tt0120737,I have seen The Hobbit six times and The Lord if the Rings twice only because Frodo is the most useless and annoying character in this entire saga. He is weak and not a good judge of character. Anytime some minor inconvenience arises he lies down and goes into a shock. Between gollum and Sam he chose gollum. And thanks to gollum the Ring was destroyed otherwise he was taking it back. What part of this entire journey was heroic for him?
tt1130884,"This is a major Scorsese so it's worth seeing but fails to cohere fully, which could be ascribed to the very large cast and complicated plot. I am still trying to find out who played 'Dr. Sheehan' but If I ever do, it probably won't help sort out the whole film. However, DiCaprio is stalwart, as the film needs him to be, and there is an abundance of filmic pleasures."
tt1345836,"To stat off I am a Nolan fan-boy so do expect a bit of a bias here - my first impression of TDKR was NOT wow (which was the case with TDK) I mean i loved the movie but it did not have so many things that its predecessor had - no joker, no awesome truck flip or the skyhook scene. no intelligent crosses like when joker sends batman to Harvey dent instead of Rachel. But despite all this, this movie had something else, something which believe lead so many people to not really appreciate it. That was its heart, its a story about Bruce Wayne, story about how he has to keep going, how it shouldn't matter that Rachel is dead or hes past his prime (make no mistake he is an aging man and not a comic character who is stuck in his thirties since over 70 years)He needed to be reminded of his true purpose and bane did just that. It made perfect sense, he learnt of his purpose due to Ra's AL ghul and if there is anyone who can re-iterate that it has to be the league of shadows itself.I think everyone should give this movie another shot, without the nitpicking, I guarantee that you will love it."
tt0110912,"We can say that the main script is relatively good, but the conversations are incredibly EMPTY as the film progresses,Some friends said that the scenes are not forgotten,yes, the scenes remain in mind, but no, he prayed before killing, no, he said no with lipstick lips, no matter if you remember them.From here on, beware of Spoilers!They talk about a foot massage for half an hour,then butch a says his girlfriend will have something with blackberries for breakfast, it takes 15 minutes. If you look at these and say they stayed in my mind, I suggest you keep in mind more useful thingssssss."
tt0468569,"I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0133093,"""Boring"" and ""who cares"" about sums up my feelings of this movie. Boring-I slept through some of it and I was awakened by the buzz of audience chatter through out the movie.  Everyone talks about it being derivative-Really- let me count the ways- Terminator II which I liked a lot- These guys must have seen Disney movies a hundred times each i.e. Alice, Cinderella, sleeping beauty, plus a lot of Roadrunner cartoons- and a lot of people are mentioning a Gap commercial! give me a break-please- Bombarding the senses does not make a great movie.Who cares-There was no characters I cared about or even knew anything about- no plot-no story-no nothing- an extremely clever cartoon-only- that's all folks."
tt0068646,"In fact, visually, Copolla lets us know that Kay and Apollonia are opposites in respect to what they mean to Michael and what their relationships mean to him. As Michael is courting Apollonia, he takes her for a walk, the camera remains behind the couple and we are not privy to their conversation as they walk onward, followed by a formative collection of sisters, cousins and perhaps even Apollonia's mother. In contrast, when Michael is courting Kay, back from his long time away, he walks with her, much like he walked with Apollonia, but now the camera is in front of the couple, and we are privy to their conversation. They too have an escort following them at a discreet distance, but now it is a black car with muscle/protection."

tt0114369,"First of all, as a criminal thing, there was no such thing as a sense of danger such as ""This is serious"" or ""I wish stopping the next crime"". There were no mystery elements, no tricks, no puzzles. Or rather, it was not made that way. So for me who was not interested in Christianity, it could only be boring.
It has an incredible reputation in the United States. Probably, the Christian part is great. But it may a huge Christian organization is investing for propaganda.
Either way, the Japanese who will be highly regarded in view of this will be children who are likely to be danced by large capitals, people who will turn right if Hollywood turns right, or devout Christians otherwise."
tt0120737,"this was one of the best films that I have seen in the last couple of years. having read the hobbit, and over a period of years read the trilogy of the lord of the rings. not in my case an easy book to read but worth the effort. I was amazed at the way the film mirrored my thoughts on all the characters and scenes. definitely not an easy job considering the power of our imagination. special mention to the actors and special effects brill.............  have no hesitation in recommending this movie. maybe a bit much for the under 12's to sit through."
tt0167260,"Yes, it's battle scenes were second to none. But battles are not all the stuff of great epics. The fact that none of its actors were nominated says alot. I feel in time the recollections of this film will be revalued to nothing more than a good movie.The edit of this film was criminally long. At 3 1/2 hours without intermission it felt like six. The ending upon ending was one weepy hobbit scene after another - emotionally redundant.I feel that two phenomenoms in hype are at play. First , it was released at a time when most epic adventures are directed without the wit, sensitivity and storyline Jackson has. Two, after investing all day into a movie, if it's good you liable to say it's great, especially after recovering from severe butt cramp.When the hype dies and people look at the film again, they'll see it for what it is. A good film with great battles and mediocre to in some cases below the line performances. Elijah Woods shades of torment read as the same response except at different volumes. While diffusion, a good sound mix save Liv Tyler from utter ridicule as she gives us her unequaled rendition of the gaumless pout.It is her stoyline I find the most distracting. Her lack of craft amidst a well trained cast, cheapens the overall perfomances. Her attempts to looks deep are as vain attempt to show life behind her eyes as her Oscar Night spectacles. Thank God she wasn't in a scene with Cate Blanchett. The contrast would reveal the babe casting truth. Was this an appeal to Frat boys far and wide. Surely they could've found a comely brunette with chops.In the end, the endless moaning and weeping of Hobbits, especially in the last reel, will be viewed for the sentimental drivel it really is.Had they cut down on this along with Liv Tyler's distraction, the film could have been a tight 2 1/2 hours with far more resonance.And on a philosophical note, are we too take the somewhat physically and sometimes mentally feeble Hobbits seriously as heroes. Their inumerable flaws often stretch the line of credibility. In this orc eat orc world of Middle Earth how they survived at all is a fantasy unto itself.On the good side, for a third installment it didn't fall into the entertainment abyss of the Matrix.In all 6 of 10 Egahd."
tt1375666,I've watched this movie because it has a great rating and because I love Christopher Nolan and in my opinion it totally deserves this great rating...it could maybe even be a little bit better...There are tones of great stuff in this movie like the concept of dreaming which the whole movie is about and this is one of the greatest concepts I've ever witnessed. It just makes soo much fun watching these Characters do their thing...On top of that the movie has such a great soundtrack. Hans Zimmer has once again topped himself. The actors also do their best to make the emotional scenes hit hard and they've done their Job really really well...This movie is one of the greatest of all time in my opinion and you should probably watch it if haven't already.
tt0120737,"It takes a brave person to attempt to direct such an epic as Lord of the rings , since many who cherish the book will point to any omission or alteration to Tolkiens masterwork as bordering on blasphemy. I have mixed feelings after seeing the movie, having read the book many times. I went to the screening with an open mind and of course realising that it is starkly impossible to accommodate all the detail and sequences from the book even spread over 3 separate films. I guess the problem is that with such an imaginative and descriptive book, each reader will visualise their own image of middle-earth and the sound,look and feel of the characters. This presents an immensely difficult job for any director to realise a version which will please all - simply not possible. I can say that many people at the screening were indeed ""wowed"" and ""blown away"" by the film. So perhaps , familiarity with the book is in this case a disadvantage. Ok so why mixed feelings ? On many levels the film is spectacularly successful - the sets ( in particular Bag End and Rivendell ) are superb. The computer graphics are top rate ( Sarumans tower Orthanc and the mines of Moria stand out ). The overall look of the film is terrific. It was also nice to have passages of dialogue lifted almost verbatim from the book. Generally the cast did a fine job. Christopher Lee is outstanding as Saruman and for my money stole the show. I think I would have preffered to have Sean Bean in the role of Aragorn/Strider since Aragorn is at first very menacing when initially encountered , and Sean is also capable of non-menacing acting as well. As Boromir he is still great. Viggo Mortnsen is great as Aragorn but to me the dynamic Sean Bean stole the screen. One thing I found wearisome was the seemingly never ending close ups on Elijah Wood ( not his fault ). Wood does a commendable job in a difficult role where he is expected to change from innocent carefree Frodo into world weary ring-bearer. For those familiar with the book the Icons such as Bilbo's Mithril coat he gives to Frodo , or the sword Narsil or the seeing stones etc will be easily recognisable but for those seeing only the film for the first time I suspect in places it may seem bewildering or these items may lose their significance. Again this is perhaps the problem .. how to do justice to it all. What to cut, what to leave in ? I cringed at the story alterations ( ommissions ok - alterations not ok ). A score out of 10 for having the guts to even attempt to film the book in the first place should be 10/10 so thanks Peter Jackson.So how does it rate ? Perhaps like this : For those who have not read the book 8 out of 10. For those who have read the book 5 out of 10. Remembering that the book is split into 3 films ( I assume they follow basically the three books which comprise Lord of the Rings ) will explain the way the first film ended ( which seemed to puzzle some people ). Should you see it ? Yes !  One area where the film definately did score was broad appeal - enough drama and visuals for the buffs and plenty of action to keep the kids happy ( note: it is rather violent in places ). Go see it soon !"
tt0468569,"I went to see the ""dark knight"" on opening weekend with my girlfriend. Both of us are comic book junkies, and we absolutely loved ""batman begins."" We went into the theater with the anticipation that we were going to see a continuation of the first movie. Although, the story has evolved since the first film, I was not as moved by the screenplay as I was before. I guess the first and foremost problem is the use of Maggie Gyllenhaal as, Rachel Dawes. Yes, I know that Katie Holmes turned down the roll, (not very smart on her part), however that subtle difference made me think less of her roll and more on the fact that she wasn't Katie Holmes. The second part that I had a problem with is that the trailers of this film, and all the hype leading up to it made Heath Ledger's roll as ""the joker"" less appealing. Although he does pull of the job of being disturbed quite well, this is in no way what I had imagined him to be. It almost seemed like his character was subdued a bit, and should have been done with greater emphasis. I still contest that Jack Nicholson was the best joker. Anyway, it is still a great movie, I saw it twice in the theater, and own it now on DVD. Inspite of all the flaws of this film, I still recommend it to comic book junkies, like myself, and anyone else who likes a good story."
tt0102926,"Hannibal. The very name sparks fear, discomfort, and ultimately recognition. He is one of the most popular screen characters of all time, the incarnation of evil, and yet strangely likable despite his distasteful savoring of human flesh. ""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice bottle of chianti,"" he tells FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) after she meets him in a prison, metal bars their only means of separation.Their first conversation and face-to-face interaction is a vital element of the film's narrative; the bars represent Starling's own self-defense; they have wide-open spaces that are easily penetrable. And Hannibal Lecter, a psychologist and cannibal, knows exactly how to reach past her own mental cell bars and crack into her brain, and he does so in the classic scene where she recalls memories from her childhood, of the lamb she tried to save...Agent Starling is on the case of a bizarre serial killer whose victims tend to be young women. Although they are unaware of his motives, it turns out the infamous ""Buffalo Bill"" is using the skin of these unfortunate victims for his own sick pleasure. He's not the sort of person you'd feel comfortable being stuck next to in an otherwise empty elevator.Clarice is smart, a feminine icon of the movies. Her brains are what propel her own investigation into the case while her desire to unearth the truth and succeed past the results of her male counterparts stems from a sort of egotistical dominance. Not many people comment upon Sterling's own sexuality, her almost overly excessive efforts at saving the victims (who happen to be females). Buffalo Bill seems to represent her own image of men: cruel creatures who inflict pain and suffering upon helpless women. Her sole friend, the only man she can rely on for help and inside tidbits, is an outcast upon society -- a metaphor for the repressed homosexuals who are abandoned by their own societies, shunned by those who feel they are not ""normal."" Harris's underlying implications of homosexuality and female dominance in the novel are admittedly stronger than in the film, although the presence of the suggestions is clearly evident under close examination.Or, it could just be about serial killers and FBI agents. You decide.Sure, the movie is famous, but we must ask ourselves whether or not the film's reputation has given it a better face over the year than it has deserved. It is well directed, but never does the film fascinate us as the bold and daring ""Se7en"" did. ""Silence of the Lambs"" is a fine film, but pales in comparison to some of its imitators and fellow genre occupants.The acting and writing is not at fault. Hopkins and Foster are superb. Hopkins received the most critical acclaim, although in 2001 we all realized that Foster was a key to the series as well, when she was unsuccessfully replaced with Julianne Moore in the sequel, ""Hannibal,"" directed by Ridley Scott, which was a total failure and disappointment for the fans of the original and source material, the novels by Thomas Harris, who has reportedly never seen ""Silence of the Lambs"" for fear that it would influence his writing.""Lambs,"" more than any other film in the series, is terribly manipulative, complete with tacky flashbacks that are out of place and all too convenient. That's where the film ultimately fails. The direction by Jonathan Demme is, truth be told, rather poor and borderline mediocre; Demme does not use cinematography to his advantage, does not use darker tones to evoke feelings from the prints as Fincher did with ""Se7en."" It's a great movie with convincing performances and a realistic script packaged in the form of a typical Hollywood thriller -- it might have a good reputation, it might be a good movie, but compared to other classics of the genre, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" just doesn't hold up as much as I had hoped it would after all these years. It's revolutionary, but isn't the masterpiece it used to be.On the plus side there's always that terrific ending to look forward to."
tt0110912,"This film worries me.  Is it great as so many say?  It's riveting viewing that's for sure.  Movies need to satisfy 5 criteria to be truly great (in my humble opinion): totally committed believable acting, technical excellence, memorable scenes that recur in your mind, something fresh to say or way to say it, and a message at its heart that can change people's lives (hopefully for the better).  This film has the first four in abundance, but fails completely on the fifth.The film is a dazzling kaleidoscope of images, sounds and emotions.It is one of the most vital films of the 90s without a doubt.  Though there is quite a lot of violence, it's less painful to watch than in other movies (e.g. Goodfellas). Rather there's a constant sense of menace, because you know Mr Quentin always has some ultra-violence and jolts to the viewer, and also the non-linear structure means it's more difficult to figure out who's going to get hit.  You get this sense of foreboding right from the off, when the couple are discussing robbing the diner, and the gun goes down on the table with a much louder noise than it should to match the volume of the dialogue.Best part of the film for me was the dancing sequence - couldn't help thinking so that's how the excellent dancer of Saturday Night Fever ended up!I have to say that they didn't get proper medical advice for this movie - giving an injection into the heart as for the overdose can't be done through the sternum (breastbone), but it has to go underneath, angled upwards.  I'm pretty sure that giving a slug of adrenaline to someone who's overdosed on cocaine would kill the person instantly rather than wake them up.  And who decided to call the drug adrenaline (its British name) when it's called epinephrine in the US?  I'm left with the impression that this was just another scene that the film makers wanted to include to shock people, rather than trying to make it true to life.Most worrying aspect is the very graphic depiction of heroin injection. It's made to seem glamorous and seductive.  Anybody trying to get off heroin who watches this movie will have a hard time resisting the impulse to follow the example shown on screen.  I think this particular scene should not have been included in the movie.  Again there's a medical inaccuracy - the blood shown being drawn back into the syringe before injecting is too bright red, that's arterial blood rather than blood from a vein.  Maybe they thought bright red makes it look more vivid (and shocking)?Overall I think this film is worth watching if you know what to expect and like that kind of thing.  However it has an empty heart which makes it fall way short of greatness.  My opinion is that tarantino is very talented in film making, but this takes a back seat compared to his desire to shock people at any cost."
tt0468569,"What is going on with all of these maximum ratings for a barely average film? According to IMDb, this is the best film of the decade so far. Not one sane person could argue that this is justified. Have the studios finally managed to get the masses to 'believe the hype'? I was a bit skeptical about this film, due to the hype, and especially because I wasn't impressed with Batman Begins, but I must admit, the heist in the first five minutes was excellent, and I thought my skepticism was unwarranted. But then Batman turned up and began speaking like a wrestler with throat cancer, and it continued to go down hill from there. What I didn't expect this film to be was tedious. But it was. It was far too long and bored my pants off me. There was no character development, the story was convoluted and over-complex and it was far too long. But my my main problem, and this goes against nearly every reviewer here, even those who weren't impressed, I thought Heath Ledger was absolutely awful! Who are these people calling for a posthumous Oscar? There is nothing I despise more than a 'look at me' performance. Ledger did all the tricks required to portray a 'crazy guy', including shifting his eyes up, down, left and right at every opportunity, and ingeniously, due to having his mouth cut as a child, he keeps licking around the inside of his mouth, which rather than being an impressive feat of method acting is actually as irritating as watching a fat man eat chips with his mouth open. His performance was utterly self-indulgent and it seems like all you sycophants fell for it. The only decent acting performance in this film is Eckhart. Caine and Morgan bore, and Bale, with his 'employ me for movie trailers' voice barely has one dimension. I would have rated this film higher if it hadn't taken itself so seriously, but as it stands it is a pretentious hyped-up and tedious movie. At last, the dark truth."
tt0120737,The Lord Of The Rings TrilogyPerhaps the best adaptation of a gargantuan novel ever made thus far.Words defy analysis but in short all the forces are martialled by Peter Jackson in service of the story that is enabled with a breadth and scope never before achieved before this.
tt0167261,"To all the obsessed Lord of the Ring fans who keep raving this movie as if it were the best movie ever made...I'm sorry, I can't get over it. I""m just so disturbed with yall voters. I can't believe this movie is at the top of the TOP 250 list, with a 9.1 voting average. That's crazy, that's insane. I mean, I could understand that yall obviously loved the movie, but why such a high rating? This is crazy...it's not that good of a movie ( I personally didn't like it and suffered for three hours), but do you people realizing what movies yall are putting Lord of the Rings  ahead of?ahead of the....Godfather Trilogy Shawshank Redemption Braveheart Star Wars Original Trilogy Memento and other fantastic moviesI mean, these movies that I have just listed surpass Lord of the Rings by far, and to say that Lord of the Rings is better than movies such teh Godfather or Shawshank Redemption is atrocious, an insult to humanity.Here are the reasons why I didn't enjoy Lord of the Ring- The Two Towers....1. We don't get anything out of this movie...it's just a lame adventure fantasy sequel, nothing more. I mean, I understand there are symbollic elements in this movie like Good vs. Evil, the light and dark, and all that other crap, but after seeing this movie, I said to myself, ""Did I gain anything from watching this movie?"" The answer is no2. shallow characters- once again, we don't get to understand or get into these chracters. Peter Jackson does an absolute horrible job of character development and we don't get to know anything about these people! I mean, because he failed to do so, I simply do not care if Froto or any of his hobbit friends die...3. A showcase of graphics, nothing more- Peter Jackson concentrates too much on Computer graphics and cinemotagrophy that direction is lost...and the storyline just kinda rolls on without any real direction. The audience sees nothing but a bunch of random trees going around, a bunch of water gushing...blah blah blah, and a bunch of random slash- and tear battle scenes. I mean, I admit, the CGI and the cinematography in this movie was amazing, but the movie can't expect those to satisfy movie goers like me.4. Crappy character interaction- Once again, like my comment #2, this movie displays poor and artificial character interaction. I just can't feel any sense of connection between the characters. I mean, I could really feel the interaction between Red and Andy Dufraine in the Shawshank Redemption, and the interaction between the Star Wars chracters...but the interaction and dialogue in the Two Towers really stink.5. Too long, too boring, drags too much- Is this movie actually fun and entertaining?....no!!!! final answer. It's 3 hours for heavens sake! And it's too slow....and drags too much6. Why do we get bombarded with annoying characters? - um, I don't even know his name, and I don't care to remember, but that bulgy eyed skinny mutant creature was so freaking annoying! 10 X more annoying than Jar Jar Binks, now that's an insult!7. No humour- When a movie has absolutely no humor in it, it has a small chance of being good. Man...how stupid were the punchlines in this movie....really stupid!! It's sad when the only guy that's attempting to be funny is that dwarf dude with the ax. You notice that I don't even remember the character's names?...(that's because I don't care). Well, i do remember the names Froto, and Aragon, i think.8. pathetic romance- man....what pathetic romance. Why can't the movie be more detailed about Aragon's romance. That's sad.9. 10. 11. .......I could go on and on...but there's no use. You Lord of the Rings fans are just too crazy and hyped about this movie, that it's no use. I wish you could appreciate deeper movies like Brave heart or the God father, or more creative and aesthetic movies such as Memento, but no no no, you people think it's the best movie all time (that's pretty sad, I still can't believe that it's the #1 movie in the top 250).i suffered through this nerdy pointless movie, and i give it 3 out of 10 stars, just for the cinematography... yes, that's the only thing good i can say about this movie, the nice scenery."
tt0848228,"Honestly I don't understand how such crappy movie could get so high notes. The only thing that is coming to my mind is that a bunch of people hired by producers has written dozen of opinions and made thousands of votes via different accounts.There is nothing in this movie that can be described as funny, entertaining or eye-catching. Story line is so miserable, one can easily say there is no story line whatsoever. It is just a series of predictable, naive events without any kind of surprise or suspense.Acting is typical for American movies - childishly bombastic. Pathetic dialogs and mimicry is so disgusting I wanted to leave cinema in the mid of the show...no show is not a good description of what I have seen.I hoped at least for special effects but my disappointment reached the ground. Cartoon-type actions of Hulk (in fact there were no point of gathering all the heroes as Hulk himself could easily defeat entire invading armada) was the last coffin nail.To summarize Avengers was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It does not happen often but I wanted that movie to end before it takes a spin (what spin?!)."
tt0068646,"All these years people have been praising this film to no end. Yesterday I watched it for the first time just to see how good it really was.First I feel quite disturbed. All the brutal shooting, wife beating, and all forms of killing and hurting made me quite uncomfortable. To me, it makes no sense to glorify violence to such degree.Put the excessive violence aside, this movie is not bad. I was not bored at all while watching it. But do I get the same satisfaction after watching Schindler's List, Taxi Driver, or Lord of the Ring series? Not really. Will I see it again? Probably not. To me, once is enough."
tt0133093,"The Matrix is a high concept film, that succeeds in its endeavour with awesome cinematography. Deserving of its praise, though not perfect.The concept and the villains are what I love most about it. Everything about the agents excellent, Hugo Weaving gives his best performance. Cypher who's Judas, the true villain of the film, the most sensible. The character development and the choice of casting in regards to Trinity, the only real weakness of the film. I feel like we could of got to know the Neo character some before this, we have no idea what he's thinking at any point, all we know is that he was the greatest hacker and that's because he's the one. The trinity character's too butch, the other female crew member in a lesser role too, what's with this? Like Cypher, I would rather just go back into the Matrix. I get that you become hardened in a certain environment, but I don't see that as the case here. So Trinity loves Neo and he has to love her back, okay. Laurence Fishburne's terrific as Morpheus."
tt0361748,"I am not the sharpest tool in the shed. I failed a lot of classes in high school including history and I know Hitler didn't get shot, burnt, and blown up in a French theater. I think every school kid knows he shot himself in a bunker a coward's death. This movie not only glorifies Hilter's death but also glorifies mutilation of enemy soldiers. Also unless I am wrong, ""Nazi"" was a word pertaining to a political party. Much like democrat or republican, if you were to think about it not all German soldiers were in the Nazi party they got drafted, and shot if they fled. This movies like many others paints the German race as pure evil and messes with history. There is a lot of subtitles that fly by so if you are a slow reader as I am, keep the DVD remote handy to pause it. Most of the movie is spoken in French and German with very little English. I wouldn't call this an ""Action Movie"" since most of the movie is coffee talk. One scene is about strudel it goes on too long as many of the talking scenes are nothing about the plot...Also if you are watching it expecting a remake of the 1978 Italian movie of the same title, it is not. The plot lines are mile apart and I prefer the Italian movie which is much better."
tt1130884,"This movie was great, loved every moment of it definately had me on the edge of my seat the whole way through, I found it to be a little slow starting but half an hour in is where its at.At this point its getting crazy without spoiling any I will only say visions, figures and talent! Such a great story.Definitely watch this movie!"
tt0172495,"Uhhhhgggg! What the Hell was that? All this movie was missing was Russell Crowe on his knees in the middle of his destroyed home shouting at the sky: ""NOOooooooooooooooo!"" a la Charlton Heston in ""Planet of The Apes."" It's kind of a Roman-period-piece-meets-Braveheart-meets-Lion King-meets-any-Van-Damme movie.Ya got yer costumes-- ya got yer battles -- ya got yer PC circle-of-life thing (complete with circle-of-life soundtrack) -- ya got yer ""ya-killed-my-family!"" revenge thing going on. There's even a bad guy that's only a few thumb-suckles away from being Prince John in Disney's ""Robin Hood."" Oh, and fer the ""adults"" yah got some complicated politics a personal redemption story and unrequited love and stuff. If this explication sounds like a mishmash, it's because that's what this movie is.Some of the more laughable instances:1) Germany, Spain, Rome & Morrocco? all less than 1-1.5 days horse-ride from each other.2) Killer tigers that like to give juicy hero-types a big hug while the hero has time to feel for a good space between their ribs for a death-strike.3) A bad guy who's about as dumb as a box of rocks. I was lauging out loud with my friend while he was giving his ""busy-busy bee"" speech.  This guy gave me a new appreciation for Sting as Fayd Haarkonen in ""Dune.""4) People who like to put dangerous poisonous cobras on a table for funsies. The snake did a *lot* of hissing, and I knew the foley artists where just *itchin'* to dub a rattle-snake-rattling sound into that scene.5) Dead-meat slaves who get to massacre the rock group ""Gwar"" not once, but twice in a coliseum.6)  and many more too numerous to mention...Constant happenstance and hokum punctuated with blood and barbarism do not a good movie make.  Substitute the words ""chaos"" and ""catastrophe"" for ""blood"" and ""barbarism"" in the last sentence and you have a statement true of ""Titanic.""  In fact,  this film was far closer to ""Titanic"" than anything else I can remember.  There's even a dead-person's-delight scene at the end -- just like in Titanic.In fact,  I could go so far as to say that ""Titanic"" was the ""chick-flick"" version of what this is,  and ""Gladiator"" is a ""guy-flick"" version of ""Titanic.""  Maybe the scripts were spit out of the same computer-program with the ""Testosterone Mode"" radio-button selected in the Preferences dialog-box.Movies like ""Ben Hur"" and ""Sparticus"" shouldn't even be mentioned in the same paragraph as the film I've been writing about for the past 20 minutes...  ;c)10 possible-1 for hokey Lion-King spiritualism.-1 for doing the nearly all the standard action cliches.-1 for the absolutely horrible villain.-2 for variation on ""Titanic"" themes/feel.--------Rating:  5 ""Yet Another Shlocky 'Blockbuster'"""
tt0468569,"Finally got to see this - I was disappointed. I haven't been this bored in a movie in quite awhile (not since Titanic at least). Heath Ledger's turn as the Joker was fine, but come on, I hate to say this, but are people saying his performance was a ""tour de force"" because the performance was so outstanding (it wasn't) or because he died prematurely (it was). The movie was dark, plodding, and overly long. There were some tense moments (ie: the ferry boats), and some of the twists and turns were interesting enough, but not enough to sustain this dank, overloaded barge. Time is always the true test of worth, and like Titanic, this movie will not hold up."
tt0068646,"I watched this movie three times in an attempt to see why such a poorly written, directed, and acted movie is so revered by fans and critics alike.
Aside from the music (which is the only good thing about this movie really), I found everything about this movie to be mediocre at best. I found the plot to be thin and simplistic, the characters to be one-dimensional and underdeveloped, the cinematography to be pretentious and boring. And the movie itself to be unnecessarily long and lacking of suspense. Overall, it looks like a documentary, and a very bad one indeed.
And the ending was a major simplistic plot convenience to the point of being stupid.
The only logical explanation for this movie's acclaim is that this movie is a mafia propaganda movie to instill fear and respect towards them. And the mafia forced critics to praise this title by placing severed horse heads in their beds!"
tt0167261,"I must admit that I did enjoy the first film and although it perhaps was a little slow in setting up the story it still remains a fairly compelling watch overall. Sadly I didn't get that same feeling when watching this second instalment for the following reasons...Firstly, splitting all of the characters up and trying to show the story from various different perspectives is a risky strategy. If it's done wrong then it can make the film feel unfocused and not particularly interesting and sadly this second instalment falls into this very trap.The film flits about from character to character, story arc to story arc without giving any particular character or story arc chance to develop or grow properly. It doesn't help that sometimes there can be long gaps from one story arc to another meaning that you may have forgotten what was going on in the previous story arc? I got the feeling that Jackson was trying to weave the stories together, but it seems that this isn't one of his strengths.The second thing that bothered me slightly about this film was the character of Gollum - for some reason I felt that we were being teased in the first film that he was an interesting character that's shrouded in mystery. Whilst his character is fun for a bit, his repetitive rantings and antics do start to grate after a while.I was also disappointed that Gandalf and Saruman weren't given much screen time here - the former seemed to just drift in and out of the story and the latter was only really featured towards the end. Although their absences were perhaps necessary to the story I found them to be the most compelling characters and was a bit annoyed that they both weren't in the film more often.The final battle sequences are nicely staged and once again the performances from the principal cast were excellent - Bernard Hill's superb performance helped the film greatly when McKellen and Lee weren't on screen. John Rhys Davies also provided some excellent comic relief which again helped to improve my overall opinion of this film.The Two Towers is still a worthy film that's relatively enjoyable, but I just felt that by splitting the characters up and in establishing separate story arcs that it felt a little disjointed and lacked the smooth and more simplistic flowing of the story in the first film."
tt0468569,"You'll like this movie... if you're between 8 and 15 year old. In USA the age bracket can probably be extended to 18.I need to post minimum 10 lines of text here to be accepted as a review, but I'm not sure I have that many words about it.It had the same puerile plot as all super hero movies with an attempt of Shakespearean twist. The hero going to the deep voice when behind the mask (so people won't recognize him?! how about the crocked teeth?) wanted to be theatrical but to me it seemed ridiculous.I think the effort to make it a somewhat sophisticated cartoon produced a move too dark for kids yet too childish for grownups... but of course I am wrong based on the number of votes here that put it on the top 10 all time :)"
tt0110912,"""Pulp Fiction"" is an American film from 1994, so this one has its 25th anniversary this year and the director here is of course Mr. Quentin Tarantino, who made this film around the age of 30 and it was his third filmmaking effort already, although most people have not really heard of his first work and only know Reservoir Dogs from his very early years. Anyway, this one here is the one that not only brought him a Palme d'Or, but also introduced him to and kept him at the Oscars for years, no decades to come. Until this day, in fact. So, let's take a look at what is most memorable about Pulp Fiction: I think last night was maybe the third time I watched this movie and the first time at a theater. It's a really long film at over 2.5 hours, but it does feel shorter for sure and that is almost a given as this film is still in the imdb top10 highest-rated movies, currently at #8, but I think it was even top5 a few years ago. Anyway, by now it's been rated by 1.7 million voters. Enough said about the movie's popularity. So many have seen it. As for the film's success with awards bodies, I already mentioned something, but it also needs to be said that Tarantino won a Screenplay Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA for his writing and that is of course a huge trifecta achievement and he was really young back then, so truly nice that he certainly delivered in the decades afterwards. I cannot really think of one filmmaker these days around the age of 30 with such a bold and unique approach to filmmaking. You can really see in almost every scene how big of a film nerd Tarantino is. And his cast here profited a lot from that too. Travolta got an Oscar nomination. He deserved it. Uma Thurman got one too and I am not so sure about her. Love her in Kill Bill and recent films where she is a scene stealer with very little screen time when working with Lars von Trier for example, but I don't know if her performance here is really good enough for a nomination, even if I am quite fond of her in general.And then there is Samuel L. Jackson of course. Everybody who knows him (only) as Nick Fury needs to see his works with Tarantino. He is so good in here, such a memorable character, easily the best from the film. And he worked a lot with Q afterwards too. His turn in the Foxx/DiCaprio/Waltz western is also magnificent. But back to this one here: I would say basically the first scene when he and Travolta enter the apartment is when the film is at its best. Judging from this one only, I would have given 4 stars out of 5 and said it is one of my favorite films of the year, but sadly it does not stay that great when we have the Butch scenes (even if also for Willis it is a contender for career-best) and also the long sequence with Travolta and Thurman and also the final scene at the restaurant again with SLJ. Now I would like to speak about a few very specific scenes and moments and, in general, inclusions that stayed in my mind here: First of all, the restaurant with all these waiters in costume was amazing. I totally wanna go there. Did not even recognize Buscemi as Buddy Holly, even if I knew he worked with Q in Reservoir Dogs. Another great actor. Same for Harvey Keitel, even if he is not one of my favorites like Buscemi. Still Mr. Wolf is such an icon. When SLJ's character hears Marsellus is sending the Wolf, it is so hilarious. We know immediately that dude is a respectable fella who knows exactly what he is doing. I'd be happy to have Mr. Wolf bark orders at me and he also would have deserved his own film. I think he had a little cameo in another Tarantino work. This character has aged really well, just like the film as a whole. Then the food: The Kahuna Burger even makes me as a vegetarian immediately wanna take a bite. And that milkshake at the restaurant! Totally worth it. Kinda hilarious by today's standards how five bucks was a lot of money for a milkshake back then. But boy is it worth it. Even Vincent agrees.Speaking of Vincent, there is a lot I can say about him. Not just his funny posture at the Wallace residence that has been used for many memes, but also for example how keeping stuff secret when everybody goes their own way is something that occurs twice after somewhat memorable events during which characters are in life-threatening situations. You will know what I mean when you see the scenes. But an act of courage and integrity by one character (even if it is indirectly also about saving one's own life in both scenarios) saves the other person too. As for Tarantino: He once again also acts in here just like he did in some of his movies, also the much later one with Waltz, SLJ and Leo I mentioned earlier. There his inclusion is probably even more fun than here. But I still loved how he makes fun of himself directing in this one we got here during the water splashing scene near the end when he is basically directing Keitel in-character. Hilarious moment. Coincidence is also a big factor in this film we have here. What if... can be asked on so many occasions. What if the girl (the stunning Maria de Medeiros) had not forgotten the ring? Vega would not have been killed and actually this really put major emphasis on SLJ's character's decision. Had he not retired, could he have been there too, killed Butch and saved Vega? What if Vega had not left the gun in the room? What if Butch had never run into Marsellus when driving back to his girl. What if all these bullets had not missed the two during the apartment? What if Vega had not accidentally killed the boy in the car. No Tarantino and Keitel in this film then. And they would not have ended at the restaurant where in the end the circle really closes and even if I do prefer chronological films most of the time, there is no denying the lack of chronology here works very well. For example, we see Vega knowing he is going to die later on. Charming moment also between Willis and Travolta when they meet for the first time.Okay, now one aspect and recurring joke I want to talk a bit about too.: Vincent Vega's toilet breaks. Every time he takes a bathroom break, catastrophe ensues outside really. Be it Mia ODing, the guys at the restaurant launching their robbery or Butch entering the apartment making toast for himself. Or indirectly also the guy at the apartment who storms outside. Okay this is not Vega taking a toilet break, but still the bathroom is really an aspect there too. This really shows you the bizarre humor Tarantino includes in his movies all the time. Kinda symbolic how toilets are significant here. And Vega apparently also does not have the best bladder or bowel movement with how often he goes. He even asks for a toilet break at his dealer's apartment after they reached an agreement. Hilarious stuff. There are many other scenes about which you will laugh. Like for example when we see Marsellus with heavy injuries from the accident ""walk"" towards Butch in order to kill him and he walks like a zombie basically firing left and right. Or the toast moment I just mentioned giving us a parallel on what/who is finished that very moment. Or also the anecdote told by Walken's character about the gold watch. I mean it is meaningful, even historically meaningful in a sense, but at the same time it is also a reference on a guy hiding a watch for years in his butthole. Two guys actually. It's kinda gross humor, but never childish fart humor or something like that.There is so much creativity and even intellect to it that it is a really great achievement and I am happy Tarantino received all this awards recognition for his work here. By the way, it is also a rare occurrence that he is not the only one credited with the script. Finally, still one minor scene that stayed in the head for me, namely how they say when they enter the apartment (where a familiar face from NCIS is in btw.) they should have brought bigger guns because there are many thugs inside (also referenced later when there was one more than they expected, so Q even delivered in terms of mathematics) and with how Vega actually brought a big gun for one enemy (i.e. For a big gun) to Butch's apartment, but it wasn't enough, so taking care of your gun and situation is eventually more important than what kind of firearm(s) you bring. And the (non-chronological) ending scene is also memorable not just again for Jackson (even if I prefer him laying actual gun vengeance on people), but also because it is pretty much the only scene and sequence in which nobody is injured and people leave the restaurant all safe and sound, despite all the potential violence that could have happened in this scene, which also shows again that SLJ's character has sort of found his path to God. And there is no bloodshed. This would be all for my review then. I am a bit sad the film did not stay as strong as it started, but it is still a big fun ride and I recommend checking it out to everybody, even if it is not one of my favorites from Tarantino. SLJ's portrayal alone makes it worth watching I think and if you are one of the 3 or 4 on this planet who haven't seen it yet, then totally go for it or I will lay my vengeance upon you! Thumbs up.Okay, just some more brainstorming here as I gave this film another watch (no pun intended!) in September 2023: I changed the rating to 4/5 now and the film deserves it. It gets better on rewatch even. I agree pretty much with all I wrote other than the rating and let me add that Danny DeVito was an executive producer here. The dictionary elaboration on the first word from the title made for a nice intro, especially as people these days agree that this movie is top-notch and the opposite of pulp. Speaking of the beginning, you will hear a truly catchy tune there too and more good music follows later on. For me this includes the Dusty Springfield and Neil Diamond songs. Also, we got many stunning women in this film. Last but not least, I would have loved to watch a sequel on Jules (SLJ). Didn't happen sadly."
tt0120815,"An amazing and compelling insight to warfare. Umbelievable camera shots/angles bring World War 2 to life especially for the US troops on D-Day. The use of flash bullets, and color saturation just add to the effect of a killing ground that not many people survive to come back from."
tt0361748,"I had the PRIVILEGE of attending the UK premier of Inglorious Basterds this evening! Having seen the trailers i had high hopes but had doubts due to a string of self indulgent films (c'mon lets be honest, self indulgence is his tarantinos middle name)I was surprised to find though that he had pulled the cat out of the bag with this one. The film is rich with interesting dialogue, Perfect timed comedy with a dash of brutal assassination.The crowning glory of this film though lies with Christoph Waltz whom no fault or error can be found. He manages to create a real tension in the audience whilst remaining quite ""theatrical"" (couldn't think of a better word). He definitely deserved his prize at Cannes and is heading for an Oscar no doubt!!!! Hoping to see him in something again soon!"
tt0372283,"Since this movie was made in San Diego, it featured a couple of my favorite bars - Live Wire and Liar's Club.  It was great to see my hometown highlighted in this movie, even one of our local ales - Arrogant Bastard Ale!"
tt0133093,"Launched in 1999 and one of the most successful movies of the year, ""Matrix"" is an amazing movie. It ranks among the movies that leave the spectator bemused, even after several projections.In a way, it's very similar to Paul Verhoeven's movie ""Total Recall"" (1990). The two movies have got a complicated but mesmerizing screenplay, astounding special effects and especially, a main character with two faces: Keanu Reeves. It means that at the beginning of the movie, he's introduced as someone who leads a peaceful but common life. But an unexpected event will transform his life and make him a hero.""Matrix"" is also a very well stable movie that you can divide in two parts: the first one mainly focuses on long dialogs sequences that incline to reflection while the second one honors stunning action sequences.A remarkable performance crowns it all and Keanu Reeves finds here his best role to date. The sole weakness of the movie is the love affair between Reeves and Laurence Fishburne. The Wachowski brothers felt compelled to include this, maybe to give their movie, a Hollywood nature.An awesome science-fiction film that easily ranks among the best movies of the nineties."
tt1130884,"I can't help but feel that if some random name was attached to this picture as director, the ratings would be a lot lower. This is a dull, plodding film that lacks both the thrills of genre and the insight of cinema. But I'm truth, I have generally found Scorcese to be sort of dull as a storyteller."
tt1853728,"Not being a Q.T. fan I didn't have high hopes for this film, I wasn'tdisappointed!The first scene had me expecting to see the man with no name come intosight!This said the whole film was beautifully shot.Mr. Fox not at his best which is usually very good, as for S. Jackson andhis ridiculous and obvious faux bold cap, I think that he thought hewas appearing in an episode of Planet of the apes!!!!!!!!The dentist was good, but not enough to lift what can only beseen as a weak apology for our for-fathers slavery sins!!Not for me but as I say QT fans will love it, wit(!), profanity, violence and buckets of blood."
tt0172495,"""Are you not entertained?!?!""One of the most perfect movies ever made. The pacing, the characterization & development. Hans Zimmer's score. John Mathieson's cinematography. Career-making acting from Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, & Djimon Hounsou. Everything is on point.This movie is an integral part of Ridley Scott's holy trinity, along with Blade Runner & Alien. Endlessly rewatchable. Endlessly quotable. An epic tragedy on the level of Shakespeare & Ancient Greece.This movie will be just as popular a hundred years from now, and no movie about Ancient Rome will have topped it."
tt0109842,"Growing up in Brooklyn, I understand some of these characters emotionally because I've been through violence myself. The climax and falling action of the movie was very well-developed, I loved the fore-shadowing like when Chucky was explaining his favorite comic book early on in the movie to Esteban and his rivals shooting each other in/in front of the deli. My favorite character is ""Fresh"" because of his ability to trick everyone so smartly as his age. I wish Nikki had more screen time and a more complex character, I wanna know more about her backstory. The movie definitely shows what kind of teenagers there are in NYC. There's the chatterbox, there's the sneaky one, the one with a temper. Us teenagers have to learn how to handle them for our own safety. From someone who doesn't see their father at all, I didn't think their relationship was that bad. I wish I had a dad i saw every now and then, even if it's barely the bare minimum."
tt1375666,"Went to see it today and came out of the cinema very disappointed, borderline angry... I have to admit though that my expectations were too big for what is after all just another summer blockbuster. First the story, you'd call it original if someone like Philip K Dick had never existed. Thing is, he really existed (we could question that after all, that would probably please both Dick and Nolan... Sigh)and he wrote dozens of books on the subject, which makes this movie anything but original storytelling wise. Also the movie is far too long, they should have cut off at least 30-45 minutes, almost fell asleep at the 1h30 point. The scenario is not even well thought, sometimes even incoherent and the director tries to hide its weaknesses with lots SFX and gunshots. I'm especially thinking about the last ""jump"" to go to the limbos, it's not the 4th level as there's no 4th level in the architect plans, the limbos, as previously told during the movie, is the place you end up in when you die in the dream and can't wake up in real life, so why is it suddenly possible for them to get there without dying ? (and don't serve me the ""they go in Cobb's mind"" crap, i don't buy it) Good points in the movie : SFX (i loved Paris folding on itself) Cast (thank god there were good actors in that movie...)All in all not such a bad movie, but certainly not a masterpiece of sheer originality. 5/10 would be my note if it wasn't so over-hyped, I chose to give 3/10 to strike back on the sheep giving it a ten when it certainly does not deserve it AT ALL."
tt0172495,"""Gladiator"". What is there to say about the ""Braveheart"" wannabe? May I say that this movie is just too highly over rated. While there are 2 or 3 scenes worth watching, I kept falling asleep. I don't understand what is the big deal about this movie. And Russel Crowe winning best actor for this? I don't get it.Like I said, there are 2 or 3 scenes worth watching. But after a while you'll want to throw yourself out the window after boring yourself. This movie can work for some, but as for me. Well, let's just say it I landed on the ground 5 times and am still standing.3/10"
tt0172495,"I have to admit I'm somewhat puzzled by the highly-marked reviews and Oscars dished out to this movie. I watched this on Blue-Ray for the first time yesterday, and my partner really enjoyed it - she'd give it two marks higher. Me, I found it occasionally good, overlong, treacle-paced, with a lot of one dimensional characters and stock situations. And a horrible, stupid ending.Gladiator follows the exploits of General Maximus (Russell Crowe), successful military commander, being betrayed by Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix), who usurps his Roman Emperor father Marcus Arelius (Richard Harris). Finding his family brutally murdered, Maximus is captured by slavers who sell him to a Gladiator school run by former Gladiator Proximo (Oliver Reed) And from here Maximus sees a chance to avenge the murder of his family.In truth the movie is rather far-fetched but with some stirring combat sequences. The opening battle in Germania is not particularly well-staged (Cavalry charge through a forest?) I have to admit I found the chief merit in the film to be the performances of some of the actors. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed are excellent, as is Joaquin Pheonix, who unfortunately appears to be acting in a different movie from everyone else. He gives a sensitive portrayal of a descent into madness (never once does he go over the top) but the film is really crying out for a black-hat villain, and is weakened overall by the character of Commodus. You feel the senate would usurp him easily, and the Roman political scenes are hopelessly inadequate in capturing the spirit of Rome.Russell Crowe is extremely dull and wooden in the part of Maximus, and I can only assume that Oscars are awarded largely on the strength of studio campaigns. Crowe himself has given much better performances. The music is also a very clich√©d variation on Mars The Bringer Of War.So, if you don't expect too much you might like it. To me it's far from a great movie. Ridley Scott has made many better films."
tt1375666,"Inception - I saw this a while ago. I only write about it, because South Park was making fun of it last night. I never got the enthusiasm for this flick. It was somewhat entertaining, although, certainly not mind blowing or even that inventive. I've seen more mind bending things on the Outer Limits from the 60's. It was not memorable. In fact, I had forgotten about it until last night. One of the things I remember was how poorly Ellen Page's character was rounded out. I remember laughing, not at her - but at the part she had to play, Ms. Exposition. Explain everything to her, so the audience knows what is going on. The action was clich√©, and left me wanting more. The whole thing about going into someone's dream is so silly, but not funny silly - which leads me to...South Park, on the other hand. Was a lot more fun. Throw in a Sheep Herder, a young Mr. Mackey, a random pizza delivery guy, and even a retired Freddy Kruger and you've got an entertaining 22 minutes. And, of course, Randy Marsh. Stan is trapped in Mr. Mackey's dream, so Randy goes in to save him. Stan sees his dad in the dream. But his dad has come into the dream as a Butterfly. Stan says ""Did you come here to help me?"" and Randy replies ""I was gonna...Butterflies have no concern for these things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterfly poon."" So much better than watching inception."

tt1853728,"I love Spaghetti westerns. I love A fistful of dollars, for a few dollars more, and of course the movie that defines Spaghetti westerns... The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Yeah... Django Unchained doesn't even begin to hold a candle to any of those classics. The truth is I liked the performances. Christoph Waltz and Jamie Foxx were excellent. Even Leonardo Dicaprio's performance was okay. However, and this is a BIG however, this film, much like many of Tarantino's most recent works, needs editing, BADLY! I really didn't like Inglorious Basterds that much, and I don't like a lot of Tarantino's films because I feel the characters lack humanity. However... the characters Django and Doctor Schultz have some humanity in them. But did that raise this movie up? No it didn't! Instead, we get thirty gallons of blood spurting every other damn time somebody fires a gun, we get long stretches of movie that don't need to be there, and as a result I honestly believe the final product suffers from the unmitigated run time.Let's face it, the very inappropriate rap music hurts the film too. This is supposed to be a SPAGHETTI western! Not a damn Gangsta Drama set in the east side homie!!! Annoyed yet? Good, now you know how I felt because of the anachronistic soundtrack. Now, I admit there are times when anachronistic music can do a movie good(See Moulin Rouge), but there is no excuse in Heaven, Earth or(Yes, even Hell) that you can give me where we have to have frickin' gangsta rap playing over the soundtrack... OF A MOVIE TAKING PLACE IN THE 1850's!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm sorry, this just makes me so damn angry you can't even imagine.The gore and the blood and the unnecessary visceral details and the prolific use of the N-word detracts from this movie so badly that it does not feel anything like a genuine spaghetti western, not even close. I'll tell you why right now: I can't ever imagine ever watching Django Unchained ever again in my lifetime. It's just a soulless little movie that left me unhappy and regretting that I didn't go see Les Miserables instead."
tt0313792,"Anything Else is, seemingly, one of Woody's most personal films. He might say something else, but that's how it seemed to me. Especially when you take into account how closely it echoes one of his most successful films, Annie Hall. There are a great many similarities, the young man in analysis, (who addresses the camera), writes material for other comics, is obsessed with death, and has a crazy yet charming girlfriend. Also similar is scenes-we first see Amanda arriving late, just as we first see Annie Hall arriving late. Plus, the motif of Woody's character telling those old jokes, mirroring how Annie Hall begins and ends. And there's a cocaine scene, remarkably similar to the classic one, to boot! Some might take this as Woody simply repeating himself, but it's not that. It's as if the older, more mature Woody is talking to the Woody of old, and saying, ""If you only knew what I knew now."" This one's really deep, and not just the simple romantic comedy some would make it out to be."
tt0111161,"In my original review, I said that I didn't hate Shawshank as much as I hated the fanbase for making it the most overrated movie ever made. On rewatching the movie, my opinion of it is lower than ever. Nevermind how Andy's escape thru the sewage pipe doesn't make much sense (during the rain storm it would've been filled with water and he wouldn't have been able to get in, assuming that in real life they even had pipes people can fit into, or how anyone could reach Mexico from New England while there's a massive manhunt for them (which is called off unrealistically quickly) despite only a few hour head-start, and how in the hell does he just walk into a bank and walk out? His picture would be circulated by then)), everything about the movie rings hollow and false; it is Hollywood escapism at its cheapest and most artificial. I felt as nonplussed by it as ever - well, that's not true - the movie is supposed to be about hope and all that typical toddler b.s., but on this viewing I found it incredibly depressing. The movie is extremely depressing when you really watch it, but everyone always focuses on the cheesy, artificial fake fantasy ending, so they forget the bleakness of the rest. It's all the more infuriating when you hear of real-life stories like Benjamin Spencer, a man who 30 years ago was falsely imprisoned and years later, even after he was proven innocent, thru a loophole, they still have him locked up to this day, which makes me even more fed up with this childish b.s. complete crap movie for the masses. Or how about all those innocent people who died in the Nazi camps? No escape for them. The more you compare this melodrama to real life, the more infuriatingly empty it is. Also, Andy's escape feels completely unearned. You don't actually get a sense of Andy's suffering (he's unrealistically nonplussed by just about everything. He feels like a cardboard stand-in). For instance, he gets sent to the hole a lot, but the movie glosses over it - he locks himself in warden's office and Morgan just gives a one line narration of how he got sent to the hole for a week, but it just instantly cuts to him joining them for lunch. The only time you see him in solitary is when warden opens the door to talk to him later on in a brief 30 second scene. That's it. It's not like Papillon where you actually spend time with Steve McQueen in the hole and you actually see him breaking down, getting lines on his face, palpable distress worsening over time. You don't get that sense with Shawshank that just glosses over all that. Also, Andy's escape feels like a cheat - warden pulls away the poster and the hole is just there, despite us never seeing Andy working on it. It's not like Escape From Alcatraz where the whole movie is planning the escape and you actually feel the tension of times when Eastwood is nearly caught working away in his cell. In Andy's cell, the hole just magically appears there, since the movie never even indicates its existence - that's not a twist, that's a cheat. Warden pulling back the poster and seeing this tunnel there is the equivalent of how in Northwest Hounded Police, the Wolf takes a pencil and literally draws a door on the wall and just walks out. I heard prisoners like this movie well enough, but I would venture that's because of the escape fantasy they can relate to, not because it's a good movie. You can show inmates a poorly acted, shot, edited, prison break-out movie and they would still probably applaud if the character escapes. What does this even add to the prison genre? It's better than most prison movies, but what does it add?"
tt0114369,"Watched this film simply because i like thrillers and this movie is supposed to be one of the best ever, at least that's what ratings on IMDb show. To say that i was disappointed would be an understatement.I found it pretty boring and a below average flick. Not worth the 8.6 ratings, it has got."
tt0381429,"""Somersault"" is a fresh spin on the in-over-their heads teenager movie, particularly the mixed-up city girl confusing the well-meaning country boy sub-genre. It is a sophisticated look at the motivations and resourcefulness of a teen age runaway.In her debut feature, writer/director Cate Shortland poignantly captures a girl's search for love and independence through sex. It isn't often that we see a film about tantalizing jail-bait from the girl's perspective.The town settings from Canberra to Jindabyne in New South Wales are unusual for Australian films we usually get to see in the U.S., providing an unusual meeting place for cold-weather tourists, the poor in their service industry, and farmers in from cattle stations.Abbie Cornish is a marvel in the central role. Looking startlingly like the young Nicole Kidman from her early Australian movies such as ""Flirting"", she morphs from coltish girl to sexual aggressor, even as it's clear she doesn't understand what she's getting herself into by thinking she can live out her fantasy in following one guy after another who she has met on the road. With the glimpses we get of her tumultuous inner world through a childish diary, ""Heidi""s naivet√© is palpably painful as Cornish projects her at different times in the film as being the character's actual 16 or pretending to be 20 when she thinks she can use sex as a manipulable tool without realizing what creepy situations can result. The subtlety of her performance extends to how differently she relates to men than women, particularly as she keeps seeking out mother figures.Sam Worthington is heartbreakingly sweet as equally naive, somewhat older ""Joe"", who clumsily becomes her protector and something more. I wasn't clear, though, about his back story with issues in his past (there's a lot of family secrets all around). The film also comments on bloke culture, including the ambiguous touches of homo-eroticism in male bonding.The scenes between these two marginalized young people are engrossing with their attraction and hesitation, as they clumsily imitate adult behavior that they can't really handle. Bouncing between maturity and immaturity, tenderness and aggression, they have enough trouble expressing and understanding their feelings without adding sex into the mixture.A side story with an autistic child leads to a way too didactic discussion about empathy and emotions, with flash cards no less.The cinematography had a lovely blue haze, but used fuzzy focus too often.I had some difficulty understanding the male dialogue among thick accents and low sound projection in the Time Square Theater, compounded by the restless male audience, up and down, in and out, slamming doors, who seemed mostly attracted to the film by Cornish's nude scenes.This film is a creative contrast to American indie films that tend to see young women on the cusp of adulthood more as victims as they experiment with their sexual power, such as ""Blue Car"" or ""Hard Candy"", or in commercial fare as innocents, like ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"", let alone male fantasy objects as in ""American Beauty"". A spate of recent non-American directors have focused on their impact on males, such as in ""The Holy Girl (La Ni√±a santa)"", ""√Ä Tout de Suite (Right Now)"", and ""Lila Says (Lila dit √ßa)"", with varying degrees of the success of this film in capturing their girl/woman confusion."
tt7286456,"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.
I went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.
What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!"
tt0120815,"To be clear; I like the Normandy beach scene¬Ö they're actually quite brilliant. But the first and last scenes are those on the cemetery with the old man and his family. Why are those scenes there? They are totally obsolete. I don't need to hear the old man ask his wife if his life was worth it. If the movie itself didn't make this clear then the movie failed¬Ö and the movie didn't fail.I saw the movie ""A thin red line"" a week earlier, and at first I was disgusted by Saving Private Ryan. It just doesn't have the same weight. But then again, you shouldn't compare these two movies as they are totally different. And when I saw this one a few times at later stages this became clear to me.The story itself is quite simple, and rightfully so. A bunch of soldiers are send to save a last of four brothers. It needs to be simple; it's the little things that make the soldiers so unique. The little stories of Matt Damons, Tom Hanks and other characters make this movie. And the comradery between the men is portrait very good as well. It's not poetic, but men which are fighting (and trying to survive) in an unforgiving war.I don't know, maybe it's just me. I just got a bit of a beef against Steven Spielberg lately. When the plot has been clear he seem to insert several more scenes that explain the plot again and again. He just needs to stop this. It makes the movie unnecessary long and dull. He does this with most of his movies in the last decade. And don't get me wrong, I got nothing against long movies, but the length needs to fit the movie.Just cut the first and last scene and all will be fine."
tt0108052,"Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.He has directed family films (""E.T.""), horror films (""Jaws""), science fiction movies (""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""), and even quite a few mature, adult dramas. ""Schindler's List"" is one of the mature, adult dramas.It is a 3 hour long epic of a film, shot in beautiful black and white. The black and white photography works perfectly with the emotional John Williams score and tough subject matter. For some reason, the images of snowy areas were really beautiful to me, and I can't explain exactly why this minor element added so much to the film for me.Spielberg explicitly shows the brutality of the Nazis, and how awful the Holocaust truly was. In this film, the shaky cam actually works to the film's advantage! It isn't over the top or distracting in any way, and makes the film feel like a kind of gritty documentary at times. It actually adds to the film, rather than ruining it!This film is just a masterpiece on every single level. There is great acting, music, cinematography, and so on...I know why the film is so universally loved. While still being brutal, ""Schindler's List"" is a very touching and powerful piece of cinema about a truly great man. I'd highly recommend the film to anybody who can handle the film's tough subject matter."
tt0120815,"All in all this isn't a bad war flick, its got a good story that flows well and i enjoyed it for the most part, there were a few moments that were dull and slow moving but on the whole it moved well and kept me interested. However the dialogue is not up to scratch in some areas particularly when the band of soldiers first set out to find Ryan, its very banal. A major problem i had with the film (and it is a fairly big one) is the nauseating patriotism that emanates from it. This seems to be a problem with others here as well, it's just irritating and spoils the whole movie for me, it's hard to ignore it because it is felt throughout the movie, in some parts more than in others, especially at the end there where the American planes bomb the German positions and the viewer once again has America to thank for saving the day. I just can't stomach that really."
tt0816692,"As you can probably ascertain from my title sentence, I am not a fan of Mr Nolan. However I don't have any bias prior to watching his films, in fact quite the opposite, I want to like his films, as I really like his ideas and concepts, which is why it's such a shame he never delivers.I also seem to be in a minority with my views as his films seem to have mass appeal, certainly if you look at money they make, but so far, they have all left me cold.Interstellar, TDK and Inception all have similar flaws: On the positive side, they are all really cinematic, stylish and well filmed. They all have really atmospheric music and nice special effects.On the negative side, the plots are terrible and make no sense. The dialog is flat and unrealistic, there is no charisma or charm in the films, they are functional and soulless and they lack any real depth or meaning. The characters tend to be robotic and cold, not warm or humorous.The problem is when you put these two elements together you basically get high expectations that something great is going to happen, but ultimately nothing does, so it becomes a major let down.On to Interstellar specifically (warning spoilers a plenty): The first hour of the film, was very boring, and very silly. The Earth is running out of food, so people still plant huge fields of crops, which they destroy when driving through them for no good reason. They have completely automated the process of farming crops, yet they don't need Scientists or Engineers, they need farmers, which makes no sense.If the Earth was starving then the crop fields would be fenced off, taken away from farmers and it would be a controlled process. Scientists and Engineers would be the most valued members of society. If the crops were so valuable they wouldn't be exposed to the elements and the dust. They would be covered and protected. Everyone is so worried about the food shortages, they don't take any notice of it. Instead they drive around in huge petrol driven SUV's from 2014 (where's the Google cars or electric cars?).Here's an idea. You now have the ability to hibernate on spaceships, so apply that to the population of Earth and reduce the need for food. Anyway let's move on.They go into space, arrive at some place and immediately land in some water. Do they survey the area first, check out the planet and landing area first in detail, nope they just land. Now I know there is time pressure, but why haven't NASA sent numerous robots into space to visit these planets and send back information.Anyway this drags on a bit, they visit another place, which is another disaster and then we get to the point of the film (only after about 2 and a half hours). Cooper flies into a black hole, where he would normally be crushed and killed instantly, but survives in some kind of advanced framework, where he very predictably sends the already sent messages back to his daughter. After this there is a very silly ending. Even though he is outside of time, as it were and he can send messages to any point, he can't for some reason stay in the same time as his daughterAnd how stupid was the 1970's Minecraft designed robot.In the end the visuals and atmospheric music was great, but the plot, soul and charm of the film was completely missing, unfortunately like all Nolan movies."

tt0816692,"This is without exception one of the dumbest films I have ever sat through. Or perhaps it's a masterpiece and I'm too dumb to understand it? Anyway .....Here are some of the things (the list is not exhaustive) that I could not get my head around.There is a catastrophic failure in most of the crops of the world. And the entire scientific community simply shrugs and says, 'Oh well. Dem's the breaks' and does nothing. Seriously? Apart from that one dude in the 'super secret' NASA compound? Okay then.A super intelligent, super advanced alien civilization has been watching us. They see that the planet is in peril. That more than six thousand million people will die from starvation. So they offer a solution. Not by curing the blight mind. No, that would be far too easy.They construct a wormhole (they being five dimensional creatures 'n' all) close to Saturn ('cos Kubrick had already used Jupiter in 2001). The film makes a big deal about corn being the only viable crop still resisting the blight (cornmash beer anybody) but it's only a matter of time before that too succumbs. So It's a matter of great urgency that the astro-heroes get to the ol' wormhole as quickly as possible.So the far side of the Moon would be a handy place to put it.No, no, noooo.They place the wormhole beside Saturn. So distant from Earth that it takes two years just to fly there.And all the while any poor kids unfortunate enough to be called Dusty are getting the crap beaten out of them at Pharming College. Anybody for cornflakes?Now NASA have already explored the wormhole. They know that it opens into another galaxy, beside a black hole and an assortment of potential new worlds. Because of the proximity of the planets to the black hole, time will be distorted and a couple of hours exploring these new worlds will translate to decades back on Earth. While back on ol' Planet earth the corn crops fail and the dust storms gather pace. So this was the plan?By the super intelligent aliens? Is someone taking the p*ss? There were no planets anywhere that were ... um ... NOT right beside a black hole? Super intelligent? Doh!And so finally, after a number of silly subplots, our hero finally descends onto the event horizon of the black hole (My God! It's full of stars?). And experiences time as a physical construct. But is he shown the origin of the blight that is wiping out the planet so that he might alert the scientific community? Hell no. He is shown his daughter's bedroom on the day that he left on his 'weekend getaway.' We see him getting really upset that his daughter isn't picking up on his STAY ...... STAY! gravity assisted message, even though he should remember that she shouted STAY .... STAY! to him on that day, and he left anyway. Sheesh!And Zimmer's soundtrack? I hadn't heard about the soundtrack request came to him via email, without him ever seeing the movie. Explains a lot really. Presumably the email went something like 'If you produce anything orchestral like Kubrick, you're off the project.' So the soundtrack consisted almost entirely of ponderous bass heavy synth driven (in the cinema where I watched it) piercingly loud quasi classical discordance. Bear in mind that Kubrick chose the pieces by Strauss, etc., to assist him in editing the movie,and then realised that they actually fit perfectly, and so discarded the original soundtrack that he had commissioned.Not Nolan.NoSirreeBob! Email it in, Hans.Who listens to the music anyway? Deeply, deeply disappointing.And I loved Inception!"
tt0172495,"Probably the worst movie to ever win the best picture Oscar (certainly the worst I've seen.)Sure, the action is fun, the acting and directing are solid and the special effects are nice, but 'best picture'? The script for Gladiator leaves so much to be desired that everything the movie has going for it was not enough to keep me interested with the characters and the story.A 'fun' popcorn movie, but no way does it deserve the best picture Oscar (even with the dearth of good movies in 2000.)just another overhyped, big budget Hollywood movie.(6/10 )"
tt0114369,That's how I record that movie.. it would be considered a B movie if it was made with a low budget and not so famous actors.. the plot is pure non-sense.. it is one of those super serial killer kind of movie.. which I simply hate with all my soul.. really stupid and annoying plot.. it is really a hard task to watch to the end.. and what a stupid end. I'd like to say something good about this movie.. it is the first time I saw Gwineowlh Patrowl (I spelled her name correctly?? hehehe). When you have a good budget you can find those mega beautiful actress out of nothing :)What else to say? Unfortunately the super serial killer kind of movie got a really success in the 90's.. B movies such as The silence of the lambs got a really wagon full of retards wanting to praise it.. I know one day it will end.. but unfortunately it isn't over yet..
tt1130884,"Are the holocaust-movies so plenty lately that even the most liberal ones are getting tired of them? But you still need to push the agenda to guilt-trip the people? Well lets make a completely unrelated movie, then scatter ¬Ñflashbacks"" in it with the most emotionally loaded pictures possible! (Dead and frozen women and children puring out of boxcars? Only the dead puppy is missing!) You might as well also put a historical controversy in the flashbacks about Allied war crimes and than claim it's a madman's fantasy at the and while you are at it. Some radical feminist agenda can also be found in the movie, for example the way they present domestic violence, or that the husband is responsible for everything, even his wife's crimes.The story itself is OK, with a clever plot twist. However there is something amiss the whole time and not in the way they intended: the island supposed to be a well locked mental hospital for the most dangerous criminally insane people in the US. But there are no Hannibal Lecters locked up there! The inmates you find are ordinary madmen with 1-2 ¬Ñordinary"" kills (without extreme brutality) tops, some of them didn't even kill anyone. These people wouldn't need a maximum security institute. The same is the problem with the threat that they will find a way to diagnose the inspector with something and than keep him there: an ordinary madman has no place in a maximum security madhouse.To sum it up: the idea for the story is good and they could have made a really good movie of it if it wasn't just an excuse for pushing an agenda. Like this it's so full of mistakes it's barely a mediocre movie."
tt0993846,"This movie motivated me to leave a review. A negative, scathing, ridiculing review. I cringed at the many awkward acting scenes between the main characters. The juvenile toilet humour used in the movie to illustrate the debasement of Jordan Belfort was boring and even nauseating at times. I found it odd that Scorcese chose to leave out Jordan Belforts Jewish background, as well as many of the main characters in the actual biography of Jordan Belfort. This undercuts much of the meaning and social commentary, not to mention irony ie. when the up and coming lords of the universe decide to call their company Stratton Oakmont' such a WASPY sounding name tee hee. such chutzpah. The scenes where Jordan Belfort talks to the camera is reminiscent of the scene from Goodfellas when 'Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta"" gets up out of the witness stand in court and starts talking to the camera. Many scenes during ""wolf of wall street"" made me feel ashamed for Scorcese because he shamelessly plagiarizes ''Goodfellas"". The trajectory of the movie is obvious and not surprising. I found this movie to be far beneath expectation. Di Caprio was alright in his efforts. Nothing special. But Matthew Mconaughey was absurd, Cringe worthy! (I was very uncomfortable watching Mconaugheys outlandish display of pounding his chest and humming a mantra. He just was not believable, his cadence was off. I definitely thought this movie could not have been any more gratuitous or glorifying of scumbags in society."
tt0372784,"I never thought Christian Bale could displace Michael Keaton as the best batman, but, sorry Michael, the deed is done.Batman fans should find no surprise in the darkness of this tale depicting the early life of Bruce Wayne, his transformation into The Batman, and one of his most harrowing adventures. I avoided reading reviews before seeing this. As a lifelong comics fan, I felt this film deserved an open mind from me. After seeing one of the trailers, I became convinced that this film was going to be based on Frank Miller's The Dark Knight, a legendary take on the 1930s Batman origin story inked in the 80s by the man who later gave us Sin City. But no, this is a fresh and original Batman film, including the significant elements of the original, but adding its own very carefully thought out embellishments. While it has all of the darkness of The Dark Knight, it has all of the plot elements of the original, and more.The familiar Batman story is told early in the film, but by the time we are allowed to focus on Wayne, he has grown into a young man. Wayne is depicted as a troubled drifter whose traumatic early life has left him seeking understanding in all of the wrong places. Bayle plays the character to the hilt - with his detachment, repressed anger and heavily depressive tendencies sustained throughout the entire film. Susceptible to any guidance that might provide him with a chance to right the wrongs he has seen, he falls under the spell of Ra's Al Ghul high in the Bhutanese Himalayas and becomes an apprentice in the League of Shadows - a secret society of ninjas who purge the world of corruption in a merciless manner. Wayne's martial arts training is where the major story arc begins.This is easily the most serious, intelligent, and adult of the batman films. It is well filmed, relentlessly fast-paced and intelligently scripted. Batman Begins also sports a phenomenal cast. I am aware that a few people felt that Katie Holmes was miscast as Rachel Dawes, but I couldn't agree less. She did a good job as, basically, the only woman in the film. The rest of the cast did not miss a beat either. The very likable Michael Caine makes a great Alfred, though I have to admit I was concerned when I first saw him on screen (having never gotten over some of his weaker efforts).With Sin City and Batman Begins coming out in the same year, it is easy to imagine that - after decades of struggle - the comic media has finally successfully broken into serious commercial films. Let's hope it's here to stay!"
tt1853728,"Django Unchainted is probably one of the greatest modern westerns and one of the best films of 2012.The film has a lot of things to enjoy.It has an interesting,original plot that will make you feel like it is a spaghetti western made in the 60s but also has the right amount of modern touches like having some humour(besides that the film is mostly a drama) and that it shows the racism that existed at the time and how white people treated black people at the time.The film has great action sequences(especially some shootouts that were amazing) and has some gore and violence.It has incredible dialogue and amazing performances by Samuel L Jackson,Jamie Foxx,Leonardo Di Caprio and Christoph Waltz.The characters in the film were interesting and developed.Django's character was the most developed in the film.His actions and emotions were justified by his tragic past and he was lovable and the film made you care for him.The antagonist Calvin Candie played by Leonardo Di Caprio was interesting,intelligent and menacing and Christoph Waltz's character Dr Shultz was also very intelligent,likable and entertaining. It goes without saying that Quentin Tarantino's directing in the film was masterful.If you haven't see this you really should but I am sure that you already have seen it a thousand times."
tt1130884,"Where do I start with a movie which is so bad from every possible angle? What is happening to cinema these days? We have one of the supposedly greatest directors, a bunch of superstar actors and an unlimited budget to make a movie. And what comes out is complete garbage, making no sense. To top it all, the movie is on the top 250 list in IMDb. Maybe a chunk the money was spent on creating a secret network all over the world on people casting a high grade on IMDb, so the movie would not come out with 3 on average. In fact, I am quite sure it was done that way. Or maybe I am delirious and should be put into an asylum? At least that is not as bad has having to suffer this movie again."
tt0848228,"I don't get why everyone likes it that much. It is what my parents call (big, bad movie) I agree with the big part but not so much on the bad part. It starts out with a dark energy research station somehow bringing Loki to earth, he makes a big mess and we have all the superheroes coming in. They capture Loki, he escapes, go to New York and fight people from another dimension. The End. As simple as that. Good Job special effects people! the main battle was great but lasted such a long time without anything but plain violence; I wanted to leave, predictable ending Loki's defeated,hooray. The only value of the whole movie is the battle scenes. Jokes are corny and unoriginal, you'll be disappointed if you want to know about the superheroes. Most people like it because they read the comics. I personally am a 2000nd's kid so its not so great."
tt7286456,Make everyone into pricks and jerks towards a clown because he'll become one of the deadliest batman villains of all time.Bedaaaaboring!From the getgo everyone was being jerks. That's not the main problem. It's just the movie lacked dept. People are jerks to Arthur and he reacts. People are jerks and Arthur reacts. That was the whole movie.Everyone that Arthur interacts with are pricks to him. With the exception to the sick children there was not one person that had a positive relationship with Arthur.This movie is evidence that anyone can make a billion dollar movie as of 2019.Lastly the movie never really starts. Once the movie gets interesting. The credits roll.
tt0120737,"This film as a standalone on its own was very well done, as it give a very interesting aspect on a world of fantasy.However when you read the book you see many important things wrong in the transition. The first irritation that can be observed is the blending of not only personalities, but also appearances of Merry and Pippin. At times in the film it is very difficult to know which of the two is doing what. Then the exclusion of Tom Bombadil, yes I know no LOTR film has him, and his importance of showing a guiding figure, and being an adviser. Also the way he symbolizes good itself, and how the ring doesn't hold power over everything. The exclusion of Gandalf's letter is also annoying as it portrays how prepared Gandalf was if he never made it to the inn. Lastly, the changing of Arwen's role is horrid. Yes, I know that there is a love story in the book, however Arwen is given such a huge part whereas in the book she is almost non-existent. Then, there is the fact of adding things that don't happen in either this book or any of the books, and excluding things from the first one. One such example is the mention of Rohan giving Mordor horses in the book however in the film it is barely mentioned."
tt0120815,"Before I start let me say that this movie was extremely well crafted, pushing the envelope in the technical aspect of filmmaking.This movie was really good if looked at in parts. The opening D-DAY sequence was beautiful. The final battle was also great. There were moments that really grabbed you (the Giovanni Ribisi monologue especially) but the film as a whole makes no sense.It said nothing. It simply contradicted itself over and over agian. The great D-DAY sequence tells us about the insanity of war, and how awful and seemingly pointless it all is. But after two hours of walking around to further build on the whole insanity of war thing, the movie goes full circle right into hollywood. The ending attempts to justify all the madness, by saying that it's all worth it because you are fighting for matt damon and of course your country (as we fade out on the american flag). Mr. Speilberg and company, What exactly are you trying to tell us?NOTE: This movie pales in comparison to Terrance Malick's THE THIN RED LINE.Although I must say, if it came down to this movie and Shakespeare in love (perhaps the worst movie to ever win an oscar... oh wait thats titanic), I would have to go with this one."
tt0172495,"This right here? Undisputed King of the Modern Day Swords and Sandals genre. It just hits that perfect note of an epic without feeling contrived or over indulgent. Ridley Scott really did something masterful here because I think this film showed an exceptional deft touch in terms of balancing accuracy and legitimacy with the feel of the movie, that emotional resonance that can overwrite some nonsense.Crowe's understated, quiet performance is perfect for Maximus and Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus is just a reminder of how skilled that man is. It's a real Batman/Joker kind of vibe with the stoic hero and the crazy, sadist villain and Phoenix is able to put these layers in there that make Commodus feel so complex and deep. It's something we're missing from a lot of villains these days who are just ""I'm big and bad because... Because!"" Instead he manages to make this character both sniveling and pathetic but also terrifying!After all this praise, it's weird to say that I don't love this movie. It's good, great even but it never quite hit me right. I never mind watching it, but also never really feel like seeking it out. This just happened to be on and I didn't change the channel or stream and wound up watching it and you know what? It's great for that, because it's a good watch."
tt0133093,"This is a cult movie. It includes many interesting techniques, spectacular effects, a good story that is built up with perfect pacing. The sense of mystery and suspense pervades the first half movie and is what is gives it its unique character. The chase and action scenes are spectacular and interesting. The characters give just enough details with their dialogue in order for the viewer to get a glimpse of what is going on, while maintaining a sense of intrigue. The dialogue and acting leaves something to be desired, however.If you like good, dark sci-fi action films, then this is for you. The pseudophilosophical exchanges might put you off."
tt0102926,"I'll confess, I prefer reading a good book to seeing a movie. There's something about the way the words come alive in my head that will always beat out even the best of movies. But when a book I love is turned into a movie, I have to see it. Call it morbid curiosity if you like; I always wonder if the story will survive the transfer from book to movie and if the director will be true to what the book does. Sometimes, the transition is better than other times. Lord of the Rings was spectacular. This movie¬Öwas not, I'm sad to say.I think the fault does not lie with the actors, at least not entirely. Anthony Hopkins shone as Hannibal (how could he not?), but his scenes were handled badly. The scene that stands out for me as the worst in the movie was, unfortunately, the first meeting between Clarice and Hannibal. This is most unfortunate because that particular scene is one of my favorites in the book. I wonder if the director actually read the book this movie is based on. To the director: with all due respect, Hannibal is a gentleman. He would not shout for Clarice because gentlemen do not shout for women as if they were dogs. According to the book, he called her name repeatedly as she was walking away, and only her desire for advancement brought her back. Also, this scene was horribly abbreviated, as were all the other scenes between Clarice and Hannibal.Part of the blame is on the shoulders of the director, but Jodie Foster in the role of Clarice must take some of the blame as well. There were moments when she made Clarice shine, and I saw in her face all the strength and courage that I loved and admired in the book. The final showdown, however, ruined it for me. Jodie may have won an Oscar for this performance, but I suspect that those who decide on those awards never read the book. Jodie showed good emotion, if the director asked for fear. Shaking hands, fast breathing, fumbling for bullets, the whole spiel. But that's not the character of Clarice. In the first place, Clarice was at the top of her shooting class; she'd practiced taking her gun out of its holster four thousand times (according to the book). She was smooth in her draw, not fumbling. In the second place, Clarice doesn't show fear. She's fully aware in the cellar that Buffalo Bill could be around every corner, and being a female and showing him fear is giving him the advantage. She knows that. According to all I've read in the book, she knows how to control her fear.Now, I'll admit, I'm biased about this movie because I love the book. And there were moments when there was a definite shine in the movie: Crawford was brilliantly good, and while Jame Gumb was a little too retarded, he did well. But what made the book brilliant was sadly lacking. I'd never buy this movie."
tt1375666,"The central idea of ""Inception"" is an interesting one: technology exists to enter other people's dreams in order to steal their most private secrets or to implant new ideas. With Christopher Nolan of ""Memento"" fame as writer and director, this should have been a smart, compelling movie. Unfortunately, ""Inception"" is a bloated failure.The root problem is that Nolan replaces the fascinating surrealism of dream worlds with lengthy outtakes from James Bond movies. For example, early in the film, when Cobb and Ariadne are sitting at a caf√© in a dream world, Cobb tells Ariadne to stay calm. What's going to happen? Is the waiter going to bring her a glass full of wriggling eyeballs? Is she going to turn around and see her best friend from high school having sex with Abraham Lincoln? No. THINGS START EXPLODING. And that's the whole movie in a nutshell: gaudy special effects and endless fight scenes as a poor substitute for imaginative ideas.The matryoshka-doll plot of dreams within dreams isn't nearly as hard to follow as one might imagine. This is largely because nothing of consequence happens at higher levels once our heroes have moved on to deeper levels. The higher-level supporting actors just fight off bad guys -- and overblown special effects -- until it's time to bring back their colleagues from the depths.Nolan should sit back, watch a few of the best movies by Luis Bunuel and David Lynch, and try again with one-tenth the budget and ten times the imagination. (Okay, that's never gonna happen, but it's *my* dream.)"
tt0429078,"I've just seen it for the second time and it's even better. This is the kind of movie you wanna see again and again, the kind of movie you fall in love with. Tsui Hark knows how to make movies, no doubt. The emotional tension is never slacking and it's very high! The action scenes are beyond masterful. They are a marvel to behold. The swords are gorgeous. The colors and cinematography are luscious. The acting is first rate. Donny Yen is mesmerizing. The costumes and makeup are hot! You can't help falling in love with the main characters who are exceptionally well developed in spite of being more than a dozen! I even absolutely fell in love with the bad guy! The storyline is simple, but that's not what you watch this movie for. Director Tsui Hark achieved something of epic scale and breadth within the traditional Wu Xia genre. Do yourself a big favor and see it."
tt0361748,"C. Waltz is the new discovery in this movie. He might have had a following in German speaking countries, but with this movie, he's getting world famous. Speaking 4 languages (and that's only in this movie, who knows how many more he is able to master) and being the main actor in this, despite the title of the movie. Which leads us to one thing that might be appalling to some people (especially to those who love(d) the original ""Inglorious Bastards"").The thing is that the ""Basterds"" (and yes the spelling mistake was intentional by Mr. Tarantino) do not get that much screen time. It's almost as if their story isn't the main act. You could have a problem with that (not only as a fan as stated above), so be aware that this is more an ensemble picture. And as said, Mr. Waltz is fantastic (I'm pretty sure we're gonna see more of him soon). Brad Pitt would be the second one to mention. Eli Roth on the other hand, as fun as it is to see him on the big screen, he just doesn't fit the bill. Til Schweiger and the other German and European actors are all really good. I'd say that some give the performance of their life.Speaking of the actors, one of the things that I really loved, is the fact that the movie is at least tri-lingual (is that a word?), french/German/English (with a bit of Italian thrown in there for good measure). That means a lot of subtitles if you watch the original version. But it works (imo) and makes the movie that much better.Another thing that you shouldn't expect though, is too much action. I heard quite a few people that criticized the movie, for being too talky. But that's Tarantino for you. There is action of course, but the long running time (might be a bummer for some) is made up by many conversations. There is tension, there is fun to be had, but the movie does take it's time to reach it's goal. Again, something that won't work for everybody. Great movie that cements Tarantinos status as great director."
tt0848228,"The Avengers movie must be a dream come true to everyone. Seeing these superheroes uniting together to save the world in the big screen. While the heroes' stand alone films doesn't have that enough action, this movie executes more of their super abilities. It's really fun and exciting. A lot of people will cheer to their favorite superheroes. This is what all fans and moviegoers want in Avengers. More fighting, more explosions, more smashing, and more fun. In the end, you will crave for more because of its awesomeness. The Avengers is simply marvelous.Our modern blockbusters are just full of explosions that makes no sense, bland characters, and too long runtime. The runtime here is long but it's necessary. The storytelling is quite simple as it gets. We already knew who these characters are. The best part is when they develop their relationship to each other. This happened mostly in the second act. These scenes are funny and entertaining. It's more entertaining when there's Robert Downey Jr. stealing the show. Of course, he will always be like this. His chemistry with Bruce Banner is wonderful. Two geniuses working together. Other than that, the rest of the performances were also good. Chris Hemsworth is just mighty enough as Thor and Chris Evans is cool enough as Captain America. Scarlett Johansson is probably the weak link here. She's still sexy though.Maybe the only problem here is the secondary villains. They are not as dangerous or as threatening as they suppose to be which makes it too easy for Hulk to smash them. But it doesn't matter because there's Loki stealing all of his scenes once again. Tom Hiddleston is simply fantastic as Loki. The action is pretty awesome. It's suppose to be awesome! The Hulk nails it in these scenes. It's exciting to see him smash stuff with glory. While there's Iron Man flying, Thor wielding his hammer, Captain America throwing his shield, and Hawkeye shooting with his archer. More explosions, just what everyone wants. It's fantastically cool and fun.There are still compelling moments and drama here but the main attraction of this film is the action and explosions. The film also cares about the characters which makes it reasonable for us to care about them and cheer to them. It's a rare kind of blockbuster these days. It has clever humor, awesome action, and really fun characters. It makes the Fans and Moviegoers happy and amazed. This is the kind of blockbuster that people should watch. This film is just cool and highly recommended to see this summer. Though, I still think the first Iron Man movie is the best of this set, but still, this is a big, fun experience you will have in the big screen."
tt0068646,This movie is a classic. It introduced a lot of up and coming stars. Definitely a movie that needs to be added to your catalog. The horse head in the bead is iconic
tt0137523,Way overrated movie. Cant believe its nr 11 of best movies.
tt0109830,"I don't get along with the messaging of this film although I'm sure its mostly harmless. It does kind of exploit scenarios and marginalized people in order to create sympathy to push its narrative. However, I guess it has a hopeful undertone at the same time. I don't enjoy this film and the acting is very uncanny and uncomfortable from Hanks playing someone with a disability he himself does not have. Its terrible acting to be frank.The one scene I laughed at was when the camera panned to Jenny's roommate. Truly hilarious moment.Ultimately, a film that I found pseudo moralistic, and misguided in its optimism."
tt0372784,"Okay, i don't know how this movie got such good reviews i don't get it. First the fighting scenes are annoying because the camera moves too much and you can barely see what they' re doing. Second for GOD SAKE this tow words "" FEAR "" and "" AFRAID "" are almost half of the script , no kidding they say those words more than 50 times on the movie it is really annoying !!!! Oh and do not forget those movement of batman, he basically have the same powers than superman, there are some scenes where he is flying , you don't see him using his stuffs. Katie Holmes had a good acting , even if in half of the time you see her she is like crying or about to. Besides those things the movie has a good story , and the guy that did Batman did good , even if i don't see him as a batman his acting was good. Oh and one more thing God! did you noticed how his voiced changed when he was batman and when he was Bruce when he is batman he has a deep scaring voice and when he is Bruce he has a normal kinda of gay voice. That doesn't really fit"
tt0068646,"Part of the reason that The Godfather has been so popular, is that on first viewing it really does seem to have something for everyone.  It's a thriller, it's a (fascinating) documentary on 'Mafia Code', and half way through, for 45 minutes, a tragic love story.For starters, the acting is sensational.  There are very few people on Earth that cannot identify Marlon Brando's whispering, horse voice and bulldog expression. It has become what is probably the most famous performance in Hollywood's history.  The appearance of Al Pacino in the starring role is also a highlight.  The other highlights are of course the 'sound bytes'. For anyone who has not scene this masterpiece, I will not give the more famous quotes away- but they will be instantly recognisable when heard.This movie is split into three parts- the crime of the family, and its consequences, the exile of Pacino, and the reunion of the family in which the characters carry out the parts of the plot which set us up for the sequel.My only criticism of this film is how long winded it is.  Virtually three hours long, it is so meticulous that it becomes very hard to digest.  While the sequel is very deep and thoughtful, this tries to balance intellect and action- and although to a certain extent it succeeds, you wonder if this film would be a more enjoyable experience if there was less discussion and plot details, and a few more thrills."
tt0361748,"DAMN IT QUENTIN, I LOVE YOU.Inglorious Basterds is the clear winner of the quentin tarantino movies, since this one is one of the most loved and mentiones movies from the director. It has a terrific ending, its just incredible as hell."
tt0114369,"Introduction Eleven years after it's release I finally got around to seeing se7en. The movie started of well. The characters are believable, the story is intriguing and thought provoking. But then I wonder.Why is the FBI able to find that one killer amidst all the thousands upon thousands who borrow books in the library, even if the selection of books is rather exotic? Why does the killer not buy the books? He has money enough to spare and the books are easy to buy in any store? And thus he is better to erase his steps. And why does the killer name himself John Doe, which is an obvious fake name, but then is silly enough to also register his real address with the library with the obvious result that the police will find him?The library records are actually a key element in the story. The police is able to track down the killer because the FBI is able to find the address of the killer in the library register. Indeed there isn't even a list: they get the address and go straight to the killers house.There is more of this in the movie, but nothing is more far fetched than the end. The entire ending rest on the assumption that Mills does not once check upon his wife. During the many hours in which the process of justice grinds, not once does Mills call his wife. Maybe to say hello or to tell her he might be late. And thus at the end the delivery man at exact seven o'clock delivers the gruesome box in the middle of nowhere that causes Mills to shoot the killers and thus making it seven kills in all. There is no way the killer could have known the box had to be there at seven o'clock as he had no control over Mills being there. It is to much of a coincidence.My conclusion It's a nice movie and might have been a good film if the story elements had been stronger. The movie is too much based on coincidences and contrived elements and this is a pity."
tt0108052,"An incredible movie.  One thing that stands out in my mind about this classic film is the great characterization of all the players due to superb acting, directing, and scripting.  Ralph Fiennes character is especially vile but at the same time human.  He may be 95% evil but to not present a stereotypical and archetypical 100% bad character makes him infinately more realistic.  Filmed in black and white, this story certainly shows the shades of gray that is the duality of man.  This is further exemplified by Schindler's own declaration of being a bad person because he could have done more good and saved more lives."
tt0430833,"I used to watch this show religiously. Yes, I consider it equal to going to church.Keith has a way of lightening up the news while making important points.He can be depended up to bring in the very best commentators to back up his own commentary and give us the real facts behind today's news.Yes, it has a liberal bias, but then the truth is the truth, and Fox News needs to have something to counteract the falsehoods.I enjoy Olbermann because he just doesn't take himself seriously and her certainly has fun bursting the overly inflated egos of those who do not have America's interests at heart."
tt0111161,"At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the ""only"" guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words ""His judgment cometh and that right soon."" The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption."" Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb: there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the ""sisters,"" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the ""redemption"" is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The Godfather) at the IMDb. Don't miss it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)"
tt0361748,"After seeing many Tarantino films and understanding and enjoying much of his darker humour and intellect, I was hugely disappointed in this movie and the way it was presented. Although many of his films are depicted with violence which is graphically portrayed this time seemed a bit out of the ordinary and over the top. Maybe after seeing so many of his films I was wasn't expecting the level of violence as it was portrayed or maybe I'm just tired of seeing the same old thing from him. The film opens up well and cements Christoph Waltz's character beautifully as the Sly, calculating and deadly SS officer, a character the was so well developed that you really hate him and just want some him to get what is deserved. Daniel Br√ºhl also plays his annoying and persistent character well and although you want him to get what he does, you also feel some pity for him. But for the rest, well they just filled the gaps in some very long drawn out scenes that by the next scene you have try and remember what the hell is going on. Story was less about the Inglorious Basterds and their exploits and more about the plight of a young Jewish girl whom escapes from the murderous (Christoph Waltz). So where this title comes from is unknown. Brad Pitt just rolls with the punches and doesn't deliver anything extraordinary. Nice touch to use an old Universal Logo at the beginning and roman numerals under the title like a 1960's war movie. But thats where the similarities end. Tarantinos effort to cross a war drama of old with his own unique style failed in my eyes by using Scalping and other various violence to make it entertaining. Very disappointed in this."
tt0167260,Sike this is the movie to rule them all. T Here is nothing much to say other than go watch this masterpiece of a movie. An end to the best trilogy there ever was and probably will be. All the Oscars are well deserved and you will see why when you watch this film
tt0230379,"Don't be deceived by the seemingly leisurely pace of ""The Indian Spirit Guide,"" written by Rober Bloch and the second of two episodes strung together from an old UK anthology series. It ends with a bang, and when I say a bang, I mean just that. Over. Finis. Shock time. Fade to black, ;eaving the viewer stunned. A widow (the marvelous Julie Harris of ""The Haunting"" fame) wants to contact her dead husband, and enlists the aid of a suave detective (Tom Adams, best known for playing James Bond-types from time to time). She pays him to attend various seances and visit various mediums and psychics, to determine if they are legit. Of course, they're all fake. Or are they? Adams decides he might as well marry the old girl and take her for all she's worth. If only he hadn't been so greedy. The final seance, where the detective gets more than he bargained for, is a a doozy and quite suspenseful. This is classic 1960s television. clearly inspired by ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""Night Gallery."""
tt0139414,"I really tried to like this one and after the film was over I thought ""What the hell!!!"".There's nothing even remotely interesting about this one:no suspense,no gore,just another politically correct Hollywood's drivel.I agree that Stan Winston's creature effects are impressive to say at least,but damn does this movie suck!Watch ""Alligator""(1980)instead,but if you like so-called ""horror movies"" like ""Scream"" then be my guest!"
tt7286456,"I wonder why DC licensed the brand to Todd n Co. The character (Arthur Fleck) never creates any chaos by himself, no manipulation n threat stuff, no explosions, no gunpowders. In short, there's very little this Joker does other than just borrowing the costume and signature laugh from the iconic character. Of course one could argue that it's a character in it's early stages before transforming into the supervillain. But then what's the fun in watching just another psychopath movie with a troubled psychotic patient getting bullied and disregarded by society. Honestly, I've seen a ton of movies with a similar plot. To make matter worse, the character doesn't even turn a villain at the end of the movie. JOKER is a mediocre attempt psychotic thriller movie which doesn't do justice to the title. The movie could've worked better as an independent film without the unnecessary portrayal of the legendary character."
tt0137523,"With all the madness and plot twists this film provides, it really does give an inspiring message. It makes you think and contemplate life once it's over.Brad Pitt is perfect for this role. He made Tyler Durden an iconic character. The film is entertaining, funny, gruesome, sad all at the same time. It's a must watch for all movie lovers."
tt1853728,"I should start off by saying that I love Tarantino. I should also mention that I went into this movie wanting to love it. But even with my pro-Tarantino bias, I only found a handful of scenes and characters the least bit interesting.The main problem with it is the cheap humor and reliance on vengeance to have the viewer connect with the story. It's some new (unfortunate) genre of slapstick-ultra-violence. The laughs are awkwardly placed into a mostly serious and action-packed narrative (and I use the description ""laughs"" loosely). Combining laughable moments in a serious scene, even a bloody scene, is one of Tarantino's strengths ( think ""Oh man, I just shot Marvin in the face."" -Pulp Fiction), but the attempts at humor in Django are childish and silly (a clansman going home because no one values his wife's KKK masks, wt-f?). They border on Wayans Brothers' type humor (not a compliment).My second point: The reliance on vengeance to keep the audience interested is, unfortunately, the foundation of this film. It's almost as if a group of frat boys got together and brainstormed on how to stick it to racism. ""How about the racist dudes get shot in the balls?!"" ""Yeah! F*#k racism!"" And, again, this is territory that Tarantino has covered brilliantly before (anti-Nazi sentiment throughout Inglorious Basterds) so he should be able to pull it off. But unlike Eli Roth smashing in the skull of an SS officer with a bat, Django's bloody scenes are pointless Van Damme-style shootouts that appeal to only the most base emotions.Maybe the difference in the successful examples from previous movies and those of Django are the two-dimensional nature of the main characters in this movie. Django, doesn't change very much from the beginning of the film to the end. And I don't just mean emotionally...for some reason, he's already a pretty good shot when he first picks up a gun? Django's character is more about the surface-level bad@*# imagery than, say, Vincet Vega, who is a bad@*#, but who is capable of emotions and character development within his role as a bad@*#. Django is just a cardboard cutout of a character with black sunglasses and a six-shooter.I guess I should mention the good parts of the movie too: Samuel L. Jackson's performance is great. His character has some of those attempts at cheap laughs, but the quality of his acting and the believability of the character make you forget about the cheesy moments. I also thought the scene where Dr. Schultz lets Django choose his own outfit was honest and believable, not to mention one of the more clever moments.I know I'm in the minority, but I was greatly disappointed and would not recommend seeing it in theaters."
tt0480025,"A film of raw, unrelenting and passionate power, This is England remains underrated director Shane Meadows greatest singular achievement and one of Britain's all-time great feature length films.Spawning a collection of worthy mini-series follow ups in the years that followed its critically praised initial release, This is England not only deals with a politically charged time in the United Kingdom's Maggie Thatcher lead period of the 80's but examines the deep undercurrent of racism often present in otherwise civilised western countries all the while being a touching coming of age story of Thomas Turgoose's 12 year old Shaun.Meadows, who has also displayed a power as a filmmaker to make uncompromising films of almost documentary style realism, evidenced in other standout efforts like A Room for Romeo Brass and Dead Man's Shoes, directs This is England with both an unflinching eye and a compassionate hand as his believable and lovable characters experience life changing events all the while surrounded by a country that has reached a boiling point of tension and rage.Led by Turgoose's incredible well-constructed debut turn as the vulnerable Shaun who finds himself a part of a ragtag group of skinheads and rascals, This is England's cast that includes such recognisable faces as Joseph Gilgun as the lovable larrikin Woody, Vicky McClure as the deep thinking Lol, Andrew Shim as the Jamaican/British Milky and a young Jack O'Connell as feisty teenager Pukey, is one of the Britain's best ever assembled casts, the case of the perfect performers coming together as a whole that proved it was no lighting in a bottle occurrence when the large portion of the cast returned again for Meadow's award winning TV follow-ups.As good as both Meadows and his cast are in This is England, this film is owned completely by one of the modern eras most commanding and attention grabbing performances by Stephan Graham as the racist, tormented and charismatic Combo.A performer who has proved time and time again that his one of the best working in the business, yet a performer who has yet to receive his just rewards, Graham's Combo is a creation that's hard to describe, a fully inhabited incarnation that can only be achieved by actors at the very top of their game.When Combo makes his entrance into This is England's characters somewhat carefree lives at the 30 minute mark of the film, Meadows film marks its change in direction and tone and enters into an hour or so of cinematic brilliance as we're driven along by Graham's tour de force turn and a story that may seem on the surface to be simplistic, but ends up flooring us with a knockout punch that will linger days after initial viewing.Encapsulating the time and place of this period incredibly well, a landscape full of checkered shirts, suspenders, shaved heads, Doc Martins and a killer soundtrack, Meadows team-up with his performers, that is steered on its powerful course by Graham, create the world that makes This is England such a special and in many ways important film experience.Final Say ‚ÄìFar from an easy watch, This is England may not be everyone's cup of tea but Shane Meadow's gut-punch of a film remains to this day one of the most deceptively powerful and memorably casted films of the 21st century that includes an outstanding debut performance from Thomas Turgoose and a career best turn from Stephen Graham.5 Ben Sherman shirts out of 5"
tt0133093,"I was one of the many people who went and saw this at the cinemas when it first came out. Unlike many of those people, I wasn't particularly blown away. While I found the ideas in the story interesting, I didn't find the way they were explored to be especially engaging. I really liked some of the effects, but thought mainly of how much I would like to see them used in a better movie. Then I left the theatre with my two friends, one a homosexual artist, the other a theology student, and they both talked and talked and talked about the impressive visuals, philosophical symbolism and deep ideas present in the film. After around 30 minutes in conversation I was asked for my opinion. Not wanting to lie, I was frank. ""Guys, 90% of that movie was as clich√© as hell (may not have been the exact word I used)"" Silence is golden.And clich√© as hell is exactly what 90% of this film is. The long leather jackets date this instantly. The hero is a Jesus allegory and he is saved by the power of love. A very poorly fleshed out and unconvincing love at that. There are one liners in the middle of gun fights, clich√©d fighting scenes, and truly boring colours and characters. This was every action movie you've ever seen, with some nice new tricks.There are plenty of positives too. After watching Hugo Weaving give excellent performances in Aussie dramas like Bodyline and The Interview, it was great to see him given a big role in a Hollywood blockbuster, and nail it. Man being imprisoned by machines is not a new idea, but I thought they did a reasonable mash-up of the various popular apocalyptic futuristic sci-fi stories. The ideas in the film were interesting, I just didn't think they explored them very well. Like I said, I didn't hate it, I was just really surprised by the OMGZ!!!!11!!! reaction it received.My feelings on the movie have mellowed since then, now that I have only seen it once or twice in the last decade, now that every church group doesn't have a weekly bible study looking at the philosophy and spiritual messages in the Matrix, and now that its impact can be fully measured. The Matrix was innovative, but inoffensive, and unquestionably, a game changer. It changed the way action films were made and it changed the way action films were written. Bullet time was a tremendous innovation that every action film used for a long time afterward. A technology that was built on and improved to the point that the effects used here barely look like a big deal. It was possible to make an intelligent action film with interesting ideas and have people pay money to watch it. Not that this one is especially endowed with intelligence. And while I've never heard someone give a testimony in church starting with (I'm imagining this being read with a deep southern accent) ""I was a sinner, until one day a friend invited me to a bible study where they used The Matrix to lead me to Jesus..."" the church certainly did get excited that this (admittedly unintentionally)had give them a mainstream evangelism tool, before they worked out in about 2007 that this wasn't all that mainstream any more.I encourage anyone to watch this and also Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, two movies that came out within a couple of years of each other and changed the way action films were made. I really hope younger audiences will be blown away by this and have a great cinematic viewing experience, appreciating just how big an impact this had. But I'm not going to lie, it just didn't do it for me. Feel free to disagree with me."
tt0429078,"Epicism is a dodgy business in cinema, yet it is a ""genre"" (for want of a better word) which has seen a rapid increase in the number of films being labelled with this description. Epic in the modern sense of the word relates to any period drama film which has scenes of intense action coupled with an overly emotive story line, and clocks in at over two hours. Seven Swords fulfils this requirement.However, as the film neared the end of its two hour plus tenure, my mind began wandering into a critical standpoint, with anticipation of the review I was to write. I concluded that I had viewed far superior fighting sequences (with Donnie Yen) in Hero, and was far more engrossed by the superb story of Flying Daggers, yet to completely right off this film would be wrong. As it would be with many other modern ""epics"". Films like Kingdom of Heaven, Alexander, all in the Gladiator mold are inoffensive but never truly captivating, thus the underlying problem with the film.The antagonists are ripped straight out from Mad Max, and I was half expecting an articulated lorry to emerge and our seven swords to fight on it.There is no issue with understanding the film, in fact I adore foreign cinema, hence my purchase of this on DVD, yet the story felt slightly forced and often static and incoherent in places, with far too many changes of camera angles. Harking back to an earlier point, the fore-mentioned issue with angles often effects the fighting sequences (billed as some of the most awe inspiring and ""epic"" - by The Daily Telegraph) you never truly feel immersed in the action, nor do you feel a voyeur of it, it's somewhere in the middle. It's inoffensive yet never truly captivating.This film is truly a modern day epic. Characters have their moments to reach out and touch the audience, but due to the action based nature of the film never really connect, and we never really identify any real reasoning for the alleged ban on martial arts, it merely seems a cunning ploy to justify grandiose sequences with Donnie Yen. However, for all the slating it is severely watchable, and possibly worth a recommendation to fans of the genre who have time to spare for an Asian epic, but perhaps it's time directors return to their dictionaries and truly find out the meaning of the word, epic."
tt0110912,"This is Tarantino's masterpiece, there's no other way to say it. It has arguably one of the smartest scripts I've ever seen. The story, which is non-linear, is so well constructed it takes several viewings to grasp it all. The movie doesn't seem to be about any spesific thing, but there is a subtle hint of redemption as a central theme. The characters and preformances in this movie are practically perfect. This is still one of the best performances I've seen from Sam Jackson, and it's an outrage he didn't win an Oscar. Each scene has its own unique flavour and charm, every segment has its own arc while also tying into the main plot. The comedy is great, the serious moments are great, every word of dialogue is exciting despite seemingly not having any reason to exist. This movie is just such a great time, and I recommend it to everyone who loves movies. I cannot think of a single genuine flaw with it, and it will remain one of my favorite movies for a long time."
tt0120815,"Spielberg returns to World War II and as usual, does not hold back from a chaotic and brutal portrayal of war. From the first scene, the viewer is assaulted with a realistically violent and gory battle that does not leave room for a break. As a way to involve the audience in an immersive experience of war, this is a perfectly mastered technique. However, the amount of disorientation can be excessive, as I often had trouble hearing the dialogue or distinguishing which soldiers were on which side. Other than that, the toll on the soldiers becomes the main emotional crux of the film although I felt that this pathos was quite forced at times - how many times can we hear a dying soldier cry for their ""mama""? And what was with the French family living in the ruins? Some of this seemed contrived just to play on the audience's heartstrings."
tt0480025,"I really don't get this film, or why it rates so highly. The acting and directing are just dreadful. Meadows' style seems to be to get a bunch of actors in a room with no script and tell them not to act.The story, such as it is, bears little resemblance to the England I knew in the early 80s. I guess it's just a self-indulgent trip down memory lane for a guy who must have had a seriously screwed-up childhood.There is nothing positive to say about this, and anybody who thinks differently must be deluded. This film is not in any way about England nor is it a piece of art or entertainment. Why anybody outside of Meadows' family would want to watch it is beyond me."
tt0361748,"Being a devoted Tarantino fan, for me this movie was a disappointment. Inglourious Basterds has its flashes of genius, as you'd expect from a Tarantino movie, but they're lost in a muddle of half-baked ideas and characters, and in the end it's probably his weakest movie so far, lacking in the one thing that even Death Proof had - energy and pace. The film does have some mentionable qualities, that are enough to make it watchable and even quite enjoyable - as you would expect from Tarantino, it's fantastically professional in every aspect, especially cinematography and sound. Some of the characters have tons of potential, and the actors are usually spot on (another honorable mention to Christoph Waltz), but there are so many characters that not one of them is developed enough to be satisfying. Tarantino fails to juggle a large number of plots and sub-plots the way he did in Jackie Brown in Pulp Fiction, and they never intertwine in any meaningful way. And worst of all, it's not even that controversial or offensive - Tarantino took a lot of liberties with history, and he certainly created violence that's more realistic and more explicit than ever before, but it's really just violence for the sake of itself. I realize I'm in a minority here, but I don't recommend this movie. I'm not saying don't watch it - there's a lot here to enjoy. But in the end, it's just not that good."
tt0120737,"Even Harry Potter has more fantasy and humor.  It has some good pictures, and that is normally quite a lot. The production Design might be exceptional but I did not get believable characters, they all look somehow Comic like, they don ¬¥thave no personality or depth. And all this monsters. It is a bad dream. HARRY POTTER is about friendship, and faith and courage, and more funnytoo."
tt0167261,"IMDb Top 250: 30 The Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers continues the epic story that began in Fellowship of the Ring. We meet new characters, develop others, and see epic battles.There is such a phenomenon in film called 'Middle film syndrome' or something of the sort. It means that in a trilogy, the middle film is the weakest because it isn't exposition like the first film, or conclusion like the third. The Two Towers is a perfect example of this concept. The awe of Fellowship isn't present, and the finish of Return of the King doesn't happen, leaving... the middle.I'm not trying to say Two Towers is a bad film. But compared to the other Lord of the Rings films, it is. They're AAA, Towers is AA. The characters introduced, like the King and nephew in Rohan, are thrown into the story without a reasonable introduction. The battle for Helm's Deep isn't that spectacular. Humour is misplaced. Even the films colour is wrong. Some of these factors can't really be fixed, because of the books, but some of them should've been dealt with.There are still some great parts of Two Towers. Gollum is nuts, batty and crazy. His presence helps Frodo and Sam's scenes, which don't actually go anywhere. The Dead Marshes are creepy. Ringwraiths return- on new mounts. And the tree battle, the only epic scene in the movie.Most of my problems with Two Towers are that the scale is diminished, no scenes other than the battle at Isengard leave the viewer in awe. The battle for Helm's Deep was also... not great. The sides weren't even close to being reasonable, making the result unbelievable. The colouring of the last battle made it seem very dark and bleak, but Gimli became a walking joke and Legolas rode a shield/surfboard. Clashing themes. The orcs didn't have anything special in that battle to make the battle interesting. In a series with groundbreaking battles, Two Towers came up short.The Two Towers is a good film, but a mediocre Lord of the Rings film. If for some reason you see it before the other two, the others are far better. Not much else I can say, you're either in it for all 3 or not in it. Fear not, Return of the King is the strongest, a worthy finish of your time. 8.3/10"
tt1345836,"'The Dark Knight Rises' isn't Epic. But its impressive nonetheless. Christopher Nolan delivers a film worth watching, however, he doesn't quiet top himself in here. Its an entertainer!'The Dark Knight Rises' Synopsis: Eight years on, a new terrorist leader, Bane, overwhelms Gotham's finest, and the Dark Knight resurfaces to protect a city that has branded him an enemy.'The Dark Knight Rises' is overtly long & dragging. Christopher Nolan & Jonathan Nolan's Screenplay is excellent in parts, but at times, it comes across as dragging & long. For example, the bad-guy, Bane, played by Tom Hardy, why does he hate Gotham so much & why he's being so god-damn heartless. There is proper reason, yet he's creating a chaos. Another flaw, lies in its running time. 168 minutes seems a bit too stretched. Christopher Nolan's Direction is extremely competent. Cinematography is grand. Editing & Art Design, are spectacular. Action-Sequences are huge.Performance-Wise: Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman, shines. The Oscar-Winning Actor is so believable & natural in his part. Tom Hardy as Bane, is a big letdown. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, is quite good. Michael Caine as Alfred, is given the backseat, while Gary Oldman as James Gordon & New-Entry Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake, are terrific. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate, has a delicious role. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, is dignified.On the whole, 'The Dark Knight Rises' is an impressive superhero flick, but it isn't half as good as its predecessor 'The Dark Knight'."
tt0848228,"The movie was such a huge box office success that I tried really hard to like it. I just couldn't. Just to be certain, I gave it a second viewing, and disliked it just as much the second time around.Firstly, if you haven't seen Thor, Iron Man, Captain America or The Incredible Hulk, you'll have no idea who the characters are and what they're all about. There haven't been films about Black Widow or Hawkeye, so they don't really matter anyway. The film played like a medley of all of these super hero movies and didn't really offer anything we haven't seen in these movies. Also, due to way too many protagonists for one film, none of them were given the opportunity to develop. In fact, I found all the characters incredibly shallow, and didn't like any of them. My favorite character in the film is probably Hulk.Everything about this film was so overblown and overdone to the level where nothing was believable - within the context of the genre, off course. 'The Avengers' was so CGI heavy that it was difficult to have fun with it. The film also had so many plot flaws and credibility issues. Everything was simply done for effect at the disposal of an interesting plot. Iron Man is just as annoying as in his own franchise (although he is the deepest character of all). So, a mere mortal in a suit Tony Stark (Iron Man) can actually outwit a god like Thor??? Wow, not much hope for gods... The same goes for the powerful god Loki, who is outwitted and outsmarted so easily.The action in 'Dragon Wars' and 'Transformers' was a lot more realistic and more enjoyable than this. I've seen it twice and that's more than enough, thanks."
tt0120737,"This film moves nothing. It's Hollywood humdrum done hundreds of times before. A little more computer graphics in this one - and so!?? You get every clich√© not one time, not two times but 200 times. What a bargain! Why do I feel the action scenes are trite and tiresome? You have the big strong fearless bad guys coming in by the dozens and they are slaughtered like swatting flies. When they finally get one of our heroes, he doesn't even have the grace of dying in an orderly fashion. He takes blow after blow still standing and then linger on in I don't know how many last words and tear-jerking remarks. Yawn!! Heroes everywhere, please have the courtesy of dying before the audience is killed from boredom.The plot is easy: heroes enter new game level, kill all bogies, heroes enter new game level, kill all bogies (repeat and count for yourselves during 3 hours). This is a glorified computer game, jump-kill, jump-kill, kick-kill, jump-kill ... ad nauseam.And the romance, oh we musn't forget the romance must we? Vision the clever producer with a bit cigar leaning back in the chair getting the original brilliant idea: ""we gotta have a broad in there, she gotta look gorgeous but what's she gonna do? Ahh, hell, doesn't matter ..."" And when you have heard the characters ""I-do-declare"" for half an hour that's enough. The rest is tiresome. In another environment the acting would have been deemed hammy. Why this film is cried out to be the masterpiece of the human history I just can't figure out."
tt1375666,"When a liquid is poured into a container, the liquid assumes the container's shape is a well known law of Phsyics. The underlying theme of this movie is Energy production. This story uses one's stages of dream states in individuals. Now comes Inception with its notion that it can change the liquid poured into the container, a chosen human target, thus altering that man's dreams and his consciousness for a desired outcome; A Dream within a Dream at deeper levels and stages of the human mind's dream states. This sums up the production of this nonsense spectacular special effects production, onward with baloney gibberish dialogs! It's ending is as pathetic as anyone could hope for! I felt disappointed with this movie, despite of the enormous efforts that were put into it by this production's Special Effects Unit who had copied and duplicated their special effects from ""Men in Black"" and from ""The Matrix."" All in all, this Sci-Fi story is an over publicized ESPIONAGE NONSENSE! I MEAN AN UTTER AND TOTAL NONSENSE!!"
tt1345836,"When I saw the dark knight rises, I expected a villain who would be able to stand up to the acting which Heath Ledger had given in the dark knight. But I was disappointed with Bane's character even though Tom Hardy tried his best it didn't have the charm which the other two villains in the prequels had... Marion Cotillard didn't do what deserved of her role.. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine had no new form or structure even after 8 years, people change with time.. and u need to show at least some change in their character.... The only people who showed justice to their roles were Anne Hathaway as catwomen and Christian Bale.... The story was nothing exceptional. But I say to the people don't expect anything like the The Dark Knight... Just an ordinary story, with an ordinary villain with no character devlopment like the Joker or Ra al gul... And a batman who can and at no point feels weaker in courage than then villain... Overall I give it a 6 for just Anne Hathaway and Christian Bale's performance with the direction of Nolan."
tt0108052,"This movie is pretty well made. There are some really cool shots but holy God what a feel BAD movie this is. I don't think there's one joke or anything in the entire movie. I know it's about the war, but my god, take a page out of It's A Beautiful Life. The tagline should be: Not for Parties!"
tt0120815,"The basic techniques of this film are sadistic gore and portentous heroic cliche. It is a revolting mixture. Dozens of times, we see the faces of people realizing they are about to die and then brutally slaughtered. As often as possible, cruelly and whilst attempting to surrender. All except the hero, who dies like a hero in an opera. And then the American flag flutters over the screen and the dewy-eyed veteran remembers.Perhaps this is 'realism'. but so what. we choose what we want to watch and what should be put in movies. And regarding the last battle sequence, do armoured divisions really attack one at a time? Perhaps this is why the Germans lost."
tt0120737,"Lord of the rings is not a bad movie but it is far from being a masterpiece as many describe it. Director Peter Jackson, who before LOTR has done mostly low budget movies, showed great skill in terms of cutting costs, dealing with complex sets and managing great number of people but his film simply lacks true epic momentum. The reason for that is simply the fact that main characters are hobbits, ells and other imagionary creatures that only fans of LOTR books can symphatize with. Also, other big minus of the film, or all three films,is Peter Jacksons preoccupation with special effects and scenery which made him forget that all of those imaginary creatures represent different types of people and their relationship towards nature. The actors did their job well, scenery is excellent and if Peter Jackson paid attention to the true meaning of the book and didn't bore us with his slow motion heart touching scenes of battle it would have been a true masterpiece."
tt0361748,"First of all some general phrases about 'Inglourious Basterds' that every fan of this movie says: great plot, great actors and unforgettable performances (yes, especially by Christoph Waltz), great cinematography and great soundtrack¬Ö Is that really it? No, there's definitely more to 'Inglourious Basterds' then what was mentioned above, there is something that makes this movie special. If one would want to summarise the whole story depicted in 'Basterds' with one phrase then it would probably be this one: 'Things are not as they appear to be, nor are they otherwise.' But it happens to be that I have a little more to say than one phrase. And soThe great moral of this movie or the great lesson that it gives us is this: our world is not just black and white, it's not the mixture of only good and bad, both 'good' and 'bad' things can be found in everyone and everything, and who is a hero and who is a villain depends totally on your perspective. Don't get me wrong, I am not talking about Hitler; but let's for example take Perrier LaPadite, how should we feel towards him? Is he a hero or a villain? He knows that if he doesn't collaborate with the Germans he and his family will be arrested and/or killed, but the Jewish family will die any way, whether he collaborates or not. And now let's look at a German Sgt. Werner Rachtman who finds himself in a similar position, and yet he shows unbelievable courage in the face of inevitable death. So should we despise him just because he's a German soldier and admire the clownish psychopath Donny Donowitz just because he's a Jew? Hardly. At least in my modest opinion. And then there are Hans Landa and Aldo Raine. I suppose that when trying to understand Landa or to express our feelings towards him we (the audience) should be very careful and we should also keep in mind that there is a very clear line between the actor and the character. Christoph Waltz was absolutely brilliant, but I guess his brilliant performance 'tricks' the audience into liking Col. Landa but if you take a second look at him you realize that no matter what intelligence and sophisticated manners (although Bridget von Hammersmark would disagree) he possesses there is not much left to like about him. As to Brad Pitt's Lt. Raine, we must like him because he's an American soldier fighting for a great cause, and so we forgive him for lacking both charm and manners and¬Ö and then we take a closer look at him too. And what we find is that there is not much to like about him either, because in reality Raine is much more similar to Landa then it might appear at a first glance. Take the interrogation scenes for example: both are quite similar (Hans Landa interrogating the French farmer/ Aldo Raine interrogating the German sergeant), the behaviour of both Landa and Raine is actually identical: the things they demand ‚Äì point where the Jews are hiding = point (on the map) where the German positions are; the things they offer ‚Äì give me information and we'll leave your family alone = give me information and will let you go; the way they behave ‚Äì actually both Landa and Raine behave rather friendly only Landa seams to be more glamorous and sophisticated; the way they both deceive their victim/captive ‚Äì they both start a seemingly innocent conversation (rats and hawks and squirrels = what are you going to do after the war) and than ‚Äìbang! ‚Äì either kill the hiding Jews or carve a swastika on a soldier's forehead. As to the movie's title I've read in some other comments that it's inappropriate because 'the Basterds are given so little time in the movie', well, to my mind it depends on who are you calling a 'basterd'; it seams to me that none of the characters is innocent, everyone is a basterd: the French farmer who (although under the great pressure) betrays the Jewish family, the German actress who betrays her country (yes, betrays, for as Landa points out she only spied for the British for money), Shoshanna who threatens to bury an axe in a man's head and kill his wife and children, a somewhat shy and innocent-looking German sniper and¬Ö yes , of course , Col. Landa, Lt. Raine and the (original) Basterds, Gestapo major and all the rest of German soldiers, Goebbels and Francesca Mondino, Hitler, but 'that goes without saying'¬Ö and those people in the audience who jeer while the 'bad guys' are being scalped...I would also like to say a couple of words about the so-called historical inaccuracy. Well, first of all, this is not a historic movie and it does not pretend to be one. The thing is, when we see a movie/read a book like 'The three musketeers' or something similar with a lot of (intended) historical inaccuracies we have no problem with that because, obviously, it all happened a long time a go, so who cares? The problem with the 'Basterds' is that the story is set against the background of WW 2 and this is still a rather sensitive topic ‚Äì you can do whatever you like with the French kings but you cannot touch Hitler. I personally find this rather odd.Now to draw up the conclusion I'll have to repeat something I've already said before: we are too accustomed to take things shown in the movie idealistically, meaning we always tend to classify, to label facts, people, ideas, etc. as either good or bad, right or wrong and we keep forgetting that there's always the other side of the coin, the other perspective"
tt1853728,"One can not stand without wondering as to how on earth someone can spend so much money with so great actors in the middle of a huge financial crisis all around the world. Except Samuel Jackson's great acting, there is nothing but a total carnage in this film. One crazy lunatic comes along, spends a huge budget, uses great names, like Morricone, and all the actors, and come up with a total waste of resources. I guess this film shows the level of mess Tarantino is at his film making ability. He totally messed up the entire Django and spaghetti western related themes, ruined the memories we had about these films.I just don't know where to begin in criticizing this film. The storyline flow, meaninglessly long but nonsense dialogues, exuberantly extended gory blood scenes, and on and on. As I kept saying, Tarantino has been on a downward slope in his career since Jacky Brown, and this film is probably lower than the bottom side. I think, or, if I were in level of authority in Hollywood, I would have banned Tarantino in making any film without going thru some treatment of some kind. I am having serious problem in understanding how on earth studio execs would fund such a carnage. I guess, this would be the last time I go and watch any Tarantino movie anymore. The level of mess in the film is beyond any explanation. If any person would do what Tarantino does in his business, he probably would be taken directly into jail by the account of misusing the company resources. What Hitler has done to the world is nothing compared to what Tarantino did to the world of spaghetti western genre. It is also bewildering to see such names like Morricone putting his name to this carnage. Despite the fact that I am a huge fan of Spaghetti Westerns, I fell asleep three times during the film. Such a huge failure beyond any explanation. I hope Tarantino stops fiddling with old films, and leave us alone with our good old memories. It is almost as disrespectful as pissing on your grand father's grave. I think people like Franco Nero should have rightly gone crazy to see how his main film was exploited so badly, and people like Sergio Corbucci would have turned twice in his grave seeing this carnage.I suggest don't even waste your time in considering this film. World deserves much better films than this."
tt0816692,"Ok, I'm a big fan of both Matthew McConaughey and Matt Damon, and this movie had some good acting and good special effects. Some of the story was even believable and interesting, but when it came to that whole book shelf in the worm hole thing - well that just ruined it for me. So let me try to get this straight - did McConaughey go into a black hole or was it a worm hole? And once inside the whatever kind of hole it was, he ended up being outside his spaceship and behind his daughters bookshelf. And then he just suddenly woke up inside a hospital?!?! So who went in the hole to rescue him? I'm sorry, but once the bookshelves came into play, I couldn't figure out what was going on and it didn't make any sense! Plus, McConaughey left Earth when his daughter was a little girl, and when he finally sees her again at the end of the movie, she is very old and near the end of her life. You'd think they'd want to spend some time catching up, but they spend about 2 minutes together and that's it."
tt1375666,"I'm not even going to waste my time writing a review, it would get lost in the ""dream world"" of positive reviews. Those who are making this out to be something profound or mind-boggling are also delusional.All it is is a muddy film with tons of plot holes and slightly better-than-average special effects. I am completely amazed at the comments about this being something more than it is. ""The Matrix"" was far, far better, made far more sense and offered far more insight into human nature, love, etc.Nolan has made a ""cluster f__k"" that must have subliminally messaging going on in some theaters cuz nobody in our theater enjoyed it very much. The acting is superb. There's one really cool scene of Paris defying gravity. Other than that there is nothing new and there is little or no logical plot line. It is just as my title says, convoluted. I'm a writer and this is the kind of stuff I delete from my novels when I begin to stray or run on.There's one review here that understands what is going on with the people who have fallen for this nightmare... he says ""There are movies for stupid people. There are movies for smart people. Then there are movies for people who like to think they're smart."" He has hit the proverbial nail on the head. This is a movie a few, likely stoned college fanboys go to see, start a conversation about ""what if..."" and create something out of nothing. Any intelligent person begins to have serious trouble coming up with answers that truly fit the massive questions in Nolan's script. To pass it off as ""well, it's all a dream"" is just a cop out. The movie doesn't really work. The dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream is just a way for him to cover his mistakes.This movie deserves a high 7 at best. In time, it will drop considerably on this site... perhaps to near #100. But that will only be due to Nolan fans. True movie buffs will never fall for this fantasy. It's ordinary storytelling and a ""make-it-up-as-you-go-along"" script.Go back to schools everyone. Stop doing drugs. This is not a fine wine... it is carbonated fruit punch.

I just can't believe that this movie is considered to be the 14th best (or 12th or whatever it is right now...) of all time!?!What's most surprising about Saving Private Ryan is that all the Americans who watched it could get out from the theaters with their big heads. They can't honestly say that this is how they thought WWII was, can they?? All Americans and not a Brit, Frenchman or anyone of another nationality in sight.This movie was made for an American crowd and to make money at the box office. Not to make a believable story about D-day.It's supposed to be really emotional when an American gets killed or injured but the Germans are shot down indiscriminately. This is sickening to me! Is an American life worth more than a German? Spielberg seems to think it is..."
tt0816692,"Just watched this in New Zealand. The IMDb rating is still above 9 at the time. Not sure it will stay there though. It's not a bad movie but it's not a great one either (which a 9 should be). It's creative in terms of story but it is drawn out. It goes for the Gravity look and feel, being slow, filmed in space and with dialog often replaced with music, but it does not have the suspense of Gravity. It's doesn't draw you in. It just doesn't have enough substance to carry it off. It has plenty of promise but lets you down in the end, especially once you pull all the pieces together to formulate what's going on. It's still worth watching, at 7/10, just don't expect a 9/10."

He left his old friends, and this turned out to be not a very good outcome. It also shows love between a girl who is 6 years older than that little boy. It was very interesting to watch the plot.

tt0361748,"Inglourious Basterds is cinema of the immature, of the man-child, of the loser film geek, of the fan-boy.It does not nourish the soul nor does it feed the mind. It's masturbatory and narcissistic... it might be the perfect reflection of what American culture has become. It's empty macabre fun, it's the cinematic equivalent of binge drinking.Basterds is very well made bad film. Tarrantino's script is overly wordy and strains at being clever. Clich√©d lines abound - see anything the Superstar Celebrity and terrible actor Brad Pitt spoke.The film's biggest sin is that it is, yet again, a movie about movies. Tarrantino's last three films have been the same thing. When will he stop cribbing from the genres he loves and think up an original idea for a film? My guess is never. Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs were audacious flukes by a young video store clerk. The middle aged man who wants to re-imagine movies from his favorite film genres bores me.Tarrantino chronologically- One Good movie, one great movie, one fair movie and the rest are garbage. His movies are overly examined and justified by sycophantic fans trying to find a touchstone to the ""true cinema"". A bit of advice to them- go watch the movies Tarrantino steals from for touchstones. His synthesis of regurgitated cinematic genres gives us nothing new... except for shining a light on the excesses of our pop culture -""oh dude! Did u see how that guys head came off with a samurai sword in Kill Bill 2?! AWESOME!"" This is what happens when a video store clerk/film geek/pot head gets to live out his fantasy.The night of the 2010 Golden Globes, as Scorsese is receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award for a lifetime of achievement in film, the cutaway to Tarrantino after the film clips from Scorsese's career is jolting. Tarrantino is scowling. He looks as if something sour flashed across his palate. I then realized that Tarrantino barely belonged in the same room as Scorsese. Maybe he realized it too."

tt0167261,"Peter Jacksons' first major task was to make Lord of the Rings into one film. ""Impossible"", Peter Jackson said, there was no way he could fit all the information into one film. But one of the producers in New Line Cinema said why not make three films because there is three books. It was exactly what the crew making the film wanted to hear. So then the scripts were re-writ to fit three films. After the theatrical release, director Peter Jackson wanted to create an extended version for each film. This was because Peter Jackson wanted to capture it for posterity.The Lord of the Rings was a cinematic masterpiece, the greatest book of the 20th Century was made into the greatest film trilogy of the 21st Century.""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers was probably the hardest to adapt,"" admitted director Peter Jackson. It was also the longest and most frustrating experience of Peter Jacksons directing career. But the two Towers is not a failure but it does not match up to the quality of the Fellowship of the Ring.The Two Towers continues the adventures of the fellowship as they separate and take their own routes; Frodo makes his way to Mordor with Sam, and his guide Gollum, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli head to find Merry and Pippin and to defend Helms Deep from Isengard. The film struggles to make an impact, although the film is good enough to keep your interest high for the concluding part in the trilogy, the Return of the King."
tt0167260,"I have the impression the LOTR trilogy is in the same category as Matrix and others like them. A first movie is made to set a standard, but subsequent movies are not able to live up to the first. Such was my impressions from watching this third installment of the LOTR trilogy.I really wanted to like this movie. This was when all would come to an end. When the story would be wrapped up, and all come to a conclusion. For me, this movie missed its mark with a couple of yards. But wait, there are nice things to say too. The scenery was good, and nature gave an overall impression of vastness and divergence of a country in turmoil. From the green fiends of Shire to the dark lands of Mordor.From there things started to go downhill. I have seen plenty of movies being able to tell twice the amount of feeling in merely half the time of LOTR. The pacing is uneven, and many many loose ends hang from the story. No, I do not want to wait for the four hour plus DVD edition to see what becomes of i.e Saruman, I wanted to see conclusions, but in many cases all I get is a bunch of question marks.All I can say about the acting was that it was meager, hidden behind layers upon layers of CGI. Today I hear people hail the detailing of Gollum as the best CGI ever, and he is quite impressive, but nevertheless obviously computer made. If not for the voicing of Serkins, Gollum would be long forgotten in a couple of weeks.The CGI way too often shades the underdevelopment of the story. For example, when the heat of the battle actually gets tense and interesting, and when we see reinforcements come to aid in still hopelessly outnumbered forces, all of a sudden the tension is gone. It is all wrapped up in the same way the battle of Helms Deep in The Two Towers, leaving me only with a ""Hey, what happened!?"". CGI can enhance elements in a movie, but it can never be all there is, as it does in the LOTR trilogy, escalating by each movie.Characters are quite two dimensional. No development takes place, and treating the royal son of Gl√≥in as a slapstick-one-liner-sidekick only serves to disappoint me.Best movie ever? Well, no! It is an Ok action flick, but with better pacing, better acting, and better story telling, this could have been THE movie. As for epic battles, I would prefer Spartacus anytime, without even a touch of CGI, but still extremely tense and impressive.I feel robbed of an experience. In my book, this gets a 5 out of 10. In visuals it is astounding. In everything else it falls rather short of lots of other movies. Too bad. I really wanted to like this one."
tt1345836,"'Batman Begins' was a symbol of identity. 'The Dark Knight' was a symbol of hope. The Dark Knight Rises is a symbol of liberation. To release one's self from the shackles of our own imprisonment. Providing deliverance to the civilians of Gotham City, oppressed by both the disappearance of Batman and Bane's arrival, a physically intimidating terrorist. Gotham is thriving from the exploitations of a lie. A fabrication. The Dent Act. Eradicating organised crime and sentencing those criminals to life imprisonment within the walls of Blackgate Penitentiary. Batman, as the caped crusader, may not be wanted anymore. Yet he lives on, manifesting his iconography into the souls who witnessed his arresting power.Nolan's conclusive act in his rebooted trilogy serves as a reflection on America's political, economical and social structures. However, it's just not a very good mirror. It's cracked. Damaged by the success of its legendary predecessor that meshed realism with superhero shenanigans perfectly.Right, where to begin? The Dark Knight Rises is over two and half hours long. There is so much plot stuffed into that runtime, that the feature itself becomes plot and only plot. Essentially, it's all plot. Nearly every single line of dialogue from the Nolans' screenplay alludes to a plot mechanic, sub-plot, plot structure or foreshadowed plot point, resulting in minimal characterisation throughout. For example, after the events of 'The Dark Knight', Bruce Wayne becomes a recluse in his own lavish mansion. For eight years, he did nothing. Selina Kyle prowls the corridors one night, stealing pearls from a seemingly ""uncrackable safe"", and all of a sudden he shifts back into the Batsuit ready to take on Bane. The only genuine development between that transition is when Alfred endearingly confronts Master Wayne about burning Rachel's letter. That's it. In fact, throughout the entire feature, that precise scene is the only authentic moment where two characters interacted without having to further the plot. Another example? ""Hotshot"" John Blake becomes conveniently promoted to detective, just because Gordon believes he represents the idealism that the Commissioner once held, and somehow deduces Wayne's secret identity. Why? Well it's so that Wayne returns as Batman, Blake investigates Bane's implausibly merciless plan and to build up Blake's real identity right at the end of the film. There are no organic conversations between these two righteous individuals, inevitably forcing them to be mere objects for a narrative derived from a multitude of plots. This vacuous aura that envelops Gotham and its residents consequently produces an incredibly inconsistent pace.The initial plane siege over Uzbekistan, powered by Zimmer's monumental score, exemplified Nolan's insistence for practical effects and categorically commenced the blockbuster with excitement. Bane's introduction was memorable, with CIA agents building him up to be the most imposing terrorist ever, and cemented a visceral style for the character. Then, for the next hour, nothing happens. Plot thickening agents for Tate's fusion reactor project, corporate rival Daggett whom is funding Bane and his mercenaries, attacking Gotham Stock Exchange to bankrupt Wayne Enterprises. That's not even a third of the sub-plots! Fast forward to a brawl between Batman and Bane, acting as a test of physical strength, and the adrenaline ramps up again. Only to then rapidly diminish minutes later when Wayne is thrown into an underground prison and must endure Gotham's reckoning as Bane traps the entire police force within tunnels after exploding half of the island. Well, you get the idea. All these plots, all these strands of franchise building/closing, are haphazardly edited together by Smith. One scene includes Batman, then cuts to Kyle, then Bane, then Daggett, then Fox, then Tate, then Blake, then Gordon and then back to Batman. Nolan, simply put, cannot juggle all of these characters and plots coherently. Some, admittedly, are more interesting than others.Then we get to the conclusive act, which turns an unbalanced yet tonally somber feature into an absolute mess. Terribly executed character reveals, a complete loss of real-time, the worst death sequence to ever grace our screens and resolving a hundred million sub-plots in the space of twenty minutes. The snowy second brawl between Batman and Bane was clunky, with a fighting style that was obviously choreographed instead of inhibiting natural fluidity. The inadequacy of certain early demises essentially destroyed the thin character development that preceded, again, likening individuals to plot devices. And the essential buildup to anarchy never really resolved itself.The harshness of my critiquing is at the forefront due to the excellence this trilogy has previously provided. Make no mistake, there are meritorious attributes to The Dark Knight Rises. Hardy's body-language exuded a menacing demeanour. Bale, as Wayne, builds himself up stoically and with subtle complexions. Hathaway certainly looked the part as Catwoman, exercising her typically nice persona with a ""bad girl"" attitude. Zimmer's score, as always, delivers in the bass department, turning the most menial scenes into epic tapestries. Pfister's cinematography, especially the IMAX sequences, were beautifully shot and saturated colours enhanced the suppressed environment of Gotham.Objectively speaking, The Dark Knight Rises is a technically astute blockbuster. Narratively though? Not in the slightest. It's a mess. Borderline boring. A case of too many ingredients unable to simmer in a broth of explosive potential. Nolan completes his renowned trilogy in a dissatisfying conclusion that, unfortunately, many will not admit to being mediocre. Marking this feature as Nolan's weakest film to date, in what is a stellar filmography."
tt0068646,"There's no transition between Michael I (american hero, away of family business) and Michael II (Sicilian mobster). The shooting of Vito and the assassination of Sonny maybe explains a psychological turn to revenge (a little material showing the attachment between Michael and each of them would have been nice), but it's not enough for this transformation into a full-fledged mafia manager, interested in brothels and casinos. The character of Kay is pathetic, living among criminals and believing Michael's promises about changing his way of life. The whole movie is a collection of excuses to present sketches of violence."
tt1853728,Quentin Tarantino was trying hard to remake Inglorious Bastards of the slavery era and it was just horribly obvious. This isn't so much cashing in but more about QT and his incredible ego. He has made a name for himself and sometimes he deserves it. Not this time though. He isn't nearly as creative as he thinks he is. It's worth seeing but I wouldn't pay top dollar. Just wait for Redbox or Netflix. The acting was outstanding in many parts and the script was true Tarantino. I just wish he hadn't made such a mirror-image of Inglorious Bastards. This ended up being an offensive and weirdly racist movie with so much of the history of slavery being completely made-up and absurd. That technique worked once with Inglorious Bastards but is just tiresome seeing it again.
tt1853728,"By incorporating a multitude of thematic Tarantino elements Django is the best Tarantino movie SINCE Pulp Fiction. Not as good as that great movie since this one is a little more bloated and less novel, it nonetheless is Tarantino's second best movie. This was great because it used many of the best aspects of the other Tarantino films. Such as the friendship between a black and white antihero (a hit-man like in Pulp Fiction but now the male bonding is as bounty hunters), also the violence art similar to Kill Bill and the Gut Warming, heart pounding, pulpy thrill of revenge against an evil like in Inglorious Bastards. There were many other aspects of Tarantino's movie in this one.To start off the complete unpredictability is what really draws you in. You really do not know what is going to happen next which is refreshing to those that frequently see movies. The episodic scenes have such a high degree of unpredictability that it mesmerizingly keeps us on the edge of our seats.There were some really amazing characters created which was not wholly due to the writer/director but the great actors who infused their talent into the roles. These characters' eccentricities were so unique that you might have never seen characters like this before. A trademark oddity in how they spoke, what they said and their ultimate actions reflected without any creative barriers the moviemaker's soul. If you thought Christopher Waltzes and Jamie Foxx's character were great wait till you get to DiCaprios and Samuel L Jacksons. You really wanted to see more of these characters despite the nearly 3 hour length of this Tarantino epic. Dicaprio's character was probably the best; he was so amusing with his warped, semi-depraved, megalomaniac eccentricity. DiCaprios acting was really good here too. Samuel L Jackson can blurt out the necessary profanities with the appropriate rawness making him the perfect actor for some of Tarantino's parts.The greatest thing is the psychological aspects to these characters and how that plays out in the scenes. There is actually a lot of psychology going on which builds multi-dimensional characters and creates scenes of intense unpredictability. There were other scenes of brilliant hilarity mocking the dark side of the old south, or genre film itself.As the movie progressed and where it could have ended well and uniquely alas a contrived scene was thrown in to showcase Tarantino's signature brand of violence art, reminiscent of Kill Bill. This weakened the movie as a whole and made it drag however it was pure fun to witness the slow motion blood splattering and detailed depiction of body parts being shot with blood shooting out like geysers drenching the place in red.I think I heard Tarantino is criticized for rehashing old movies or copying from other films. I guarantee whether or not that is the case you've never seen something like this before."
tt0120737,"I feel compelled to offer some dissent for this mistakenly lauded, and often drooled over catastrophe of a film. Let me preface this by saying that I have not read the book. While this may offend those of you who keep a copy under your mattress, you must understand that by releasing this as a motion picture, it must be able to stand on its own as one.My largest complaint is just that, the writers did absolutely nothing to prepare this story for the screen, other than relying on a gifted cinematographer and production designer to carry the weight. I felt every minute of this story as if it were being read from the pages of Tolkien's umpteenth printing by a four-year-old. The dialogue is slow, awkward, and unjustly sentimental. To someone who has not read the book and doesn't have the pretext of the characters and their motivations, the lines are just as mystical as the glowing ring that every one scampers around in fear of.Other than the spooky horsemen that chase around Frodo the cowardly protagonist, I simply could not find any reason for these middle earth misfits to do what they did. And if you don't find the scene where they all get together under ""Agent"" Hugo Weaving's direction and decide who's the bravest pussy in middle earth absolutely corny and remedial, then you just weren't listening. I'm still not sure what was less convincing: the ridiculous lines or the misdirected attempts to act them.After three hours, and having lost complete sensation in my ass, they have the audacity to end the movie when things are finally starting to happen. At least Star Wars was sufficiently independent in each of its chapters. I didn't have to wait three years and pay $24 to get a coherent story.On a positive note, I have to give credit to the DP and his aesthetic capture of New Zealand. Well done. Seeing your photography was the only aspect that made me feel value for my money. That applies to the inhabitants of New Zealand as well. Thanks for letting us expose your country to the world. I only hope that the leagues of trench coat-wearing D&D players flocking to your ports will spare you from the middle earth references they're dying to make."
tt0848228,"I cannot believe The Avengers has received such stellar reviews. By 1/3 the way into the film, none of the characters draw one in, the story is uncompelling and I find myself only waiting in boredom for the next fight scenes which turn out to be formulaic and insufficient to warrant further viewing. The designs for various scenes and characters also fail. They look plastic and cheap and distracting from the story rather than immersive. Save your time and money and skip this title. Evidently these reviews have a minimum line count which is equivalent to paying by the word. So let me be verbose. This film was not even fun to watch the villains tearing apart the world because they look so silly in their costumes, their character building moments are horribly predictable and shallow, and what is up with the designs for Loki? He looks more samurai than Scandinavian god, which I am sure is a tip of the hat to the samurai influence in comic books, but let's get real for a moment. He's a bloody Norse god. He should look Norse. If he's going to look so radically different from Norse mythology -- all cybernetic-anime -- then there needs to be some kind of story and character building to explain it."
tt0372784,This was by the far the most overrated heap of 2005. It appeals to the A.D.D. X-Box generation. Who cares about Year One. That was just as overrated. This played so much like a video game from beginning to end I didn't feel like I was watching a movie. A lot of action and blowing stuff up for the sake of blowing it up. Bale was horrible as Batman with that ridiculous raspy voice. What the **** was that about? And in this version apparently Batman is also a pedophile. Katie Holmes as his love interest? She looked like she was 14. Guess this is the start of some kind of trend because Kate Bosworth looks like she's a pre-teen and is playing Lois Lane in Superman Returns. Ewww. We definitely all the vacuous kiddies to thank for this slew of super hero movie crappola.
tt7286456,"A confused representation of insanity from a perspective of a sane person, a celebration of madness and chaos.
At last, I have watched one of the most anticipated movies of this year.
I experienced sadness, creepiness, joy, rage, confusion altogether, and it felt good.
The story was above average, sometimes the director seemed confused about what he's trying to say.
There were so many beautiful distinct pieces scattered throughout the film that gives you chills but ultimately they failed to form a complete landscape, eventually it became a gorgeously crafted baroque film with a sheer hollow inside.
It criticizes our self-centered, pretentious, empathy less society but ironically the movie itself falls under its own sword.Welcome, Tod Phillips to the big boy's club! His direction was crafty and pretty awesome though lack a little bit of originality. His trick with Arthur's illusion seemed a bit risky given its context. We will never know for sure if Arthur did go Murray's show or not!The cinematography was superb, there were plenty of scenes that'll enter your mind and stay there for a while.Joaquin Phoenix did his best, tried hard to embody the magnanimous character of Joker, he did pretty well, but sometimes it felt he was just trying too hard. Despite it's unfair to compare him with great heath ledger I must say he was able to pull it off impressively and takes this Joker to a distinct level. It was a one-man show and he's gonna get nominated for the academy award for sure.One of the most entertaining and satisfying aspects of this film is its music composition, damn! It was too good, and you'll get to see some insane dance move as a bonus.
The main problem with this film is the lack of originality and a precise plot, sometimes it felt like the movie itself was confused and wandering aimlessly! That's why it failed to become a complete cinematic art rather than a montage of eye pleasing scenes, and nothing more.Overall, despite its shortcomings, this movie is definitely one of the most exciting movie of this year.My Rating:7.5/10"
tt0993846,"The title of the film and its director were clearly enough to warrant seeing this one. But I was annoyed at how poor the acting was, and the incessant ultra-sharp close-ups of bad actors speaking mindless dialog made it too hard to watch more than the first half. While the storyline had a decent premise, its portrayal was shallow at best.There was almost no character development and no one you could identify with, which made it a bit better than a SNL skit. While the photography was good, it was put too bad use unless you like watching bimbos and greedy nerds frolic in cartoonish and gratuitous sex scenes.This wolf was a total dog. I'm not a great lover of Oliver Stone flicks, but his ""Wall Street"" puts this one to shame."
tt7286456,So worth it! Amazing comic book movie that stands out from the crowd
tt7286456,"This film has two sides of story:1. How cruel people can be with others, specially with dissadvantage/different people (in this case, with mental problems). This happens in real life and the film represents this cruel reality. It is a call to action.2. The second part is how delicate is the balance in those with mental health issues which can trigger disastreous consecuences: harm others.3. The third part, is the number of followers that a mentally impaired person can have. And that reminds me to the Catalan conflict, people following Catalan ""leaders"" who are full of lies who have end up believing their own lies, like Joker.Very good film."
tt0429078,"I was really looking forward to this movie my favourite action star, Donnie Yen is in it. There were doubts of course, mostly concerning Leon Lai(the Keanu Reeves of Asian Cinema), and Tsui Hark, who seem to have lost his touch. the doubts were realised when i saw the movie.Leon Lai is okay in the movie, however, Tsui hark seems to have really lost the plot. the movie itself is pretty enjoyable thanks to its action scenes, especially the Finale. Tsui Hark talked about bringing in a new style of action in light of the CG heavy stuff that has been going on. However, the action is not new but 80s old school action that he used to do.The editing, pacing and character development on the other hand is far from satisfactory. Instead of focusing on the characters and their unique weapons, the film just dwells on love scenes and a romantic triangle that doesn't go anywhere. when the film does focus on the characters it hardly scratches the surface. Scenes which should go by faster is dragged on and on while scenes that should have more is ignored.the film is called Seven Swords but by the end you would hardly know the difference between the swords. it was said in the film that they are give to the seven swordsman for a reason but the reason for why this person got this sword instead of the other is never explained. Tsui Hark is again guilty of cashing in on a fad. In Legend of Zu, it was putting Zhang Ziyi in a crappy and totally unnecessary role because she was a hot commodity at the time. Here is is using a Korean actress and using Korean dialogue to cash in on the Korean fad sweeping Asian. Her character has a lot of screen time which just slows the film down.This film could have been so much better and it promised so much more but ultimately fails to deliver."
tt0068646,"No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.My Grade--- Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-"
tt0172495,"Russell Crowe's fine performance as an ex-general turned into a slave and then a gladiator cannot save this picture from its utter absurdity, as the ending stages a pathetic duel between him and (no kidding) the Emperor of Rome in the Coliseum!!! There are some impressive scenes in the film, and Crowe has a beautiful screen presence; his friendship with a fellow Numidian gladiator is nicely conveyed, as is his attachment to amulets representing his family; the revelation of his identity is aptly charged with tension; and the preparation of the first battle is superb. Alas, it then turns into an orgy of gore.Being an ancient Greek (Theban to be precise) general, I'm bound to have qualms about this film's treatment of antiquity. As many reviewers have noted, the sole idea of a roman citizen (let alone a general) being turned into a slave is absurd, as is the trip from Germania to Spain during which Crowe seems to pass through some sort of rocky desert before entering the hills of Tuscany... How familiar is the filmmaker with the geography of Europe I wonder? Depictions of power relations in Rome are also quite laughable.But it is the voyeuristic stance and contemporary political relevance of the film which I find most disturbing. The despisal/fascination for the 'mob' which runs through the film has a distinctly fascist tinge. The violence is in some places unbearable, all the more so as it is gratuitous (the slaughter of Maximus' son)... My deep rejection and indeed contempt for the film really developed from listening to Ridley Scott's commentary on the DVD, in which he avows, among other depressing platitudes, that he would really have liked to live in Roman times, granted he was among the wealthy ruling classes... Probably in order to enjoy the spectacle of death and violence he in turn successfully inflicts on his twentieth-century teenage audience. The implications of such a fascination for slavery and violence are frightening, and make one want to watch SPARTACUS over and over again, as a reminder of the times in which Hollywood stood for humanist values, and not their despisal. It is also an opportunity to find where many seemingly novel ideas in GLADIATOR actually originate...All in all, despite how much we want to believe in Crowe, the film is far from the historical and psychological complexity (and visual clarity in battle scenes) of the much-underrated Alexander. Indeed, Crowe would have been perfect in the part, and would probably have had the guts to oppose to the wearing of Colin Farrell's ridiculous blonde wig!"
tt0172495,"Some movies manage to split the public and critics' opinions right down the middle but still manage to do well at the box office and get tons of awards notice and high ratings. ""Gladiator"" is one of the biggest examples of this, and I am in the camp that finds this to be a weak film.2000 was fairly weak year for movies, but this isn't an excuse for ""Gladiator"" winning the Best Picture Oscar. You still had great films that were completely snubbed like ""Almost Famous"" (my choice), Billy Elliot, Cast Away, Wonder Boys, and among the nominees, Traffic. These films represented the few glimmering moments of film in 2000.Gladiator has actually grown on me with repeated viewings but it is still by no means a great or even good movie. I feel that Russell Crowe did not deserve the Oscar over his entire category and while I am not a huge fan of him as an actor or from what his persona perceives, he did give good performances in ""L.A. Confidential"", ""Romper Stomper"", ""The Insider"", and ""Cinderella Man"" and these went relatively unnoticed (save for ""The Insider""). The movie just didn't feel like a Best Picture winner either. It had all of the right ingredients but it came out stale and bland."
tt0167261,"Peter Jackson and his mission - well not his mission, but the mission of our Fellowship (well you get the picture and no pun intended). This is part two and it holds up pretty well to say the least. The movie has the New Zealand landscapes and tries to put as much of the book into the movie as possible.I never read the books, I did try to read the Hobbit before the movies came out ... which I failed to do - but the movies are really well done. Yes Peter got money, but the work he did for it ... not sure if he has health issues because of all the planning and work he had to do for the Tolkien universe he created ... but he did a really good job to say the least.This begins where the first movie left off - and the group will have more adventures, but also has to go different paths - to cover more ground (no pun intended), but also have different stories and people to meet. In the extended edition I watched (actually rewatched because I had seen the theatrical and the longer cut back in the day), you can see even more stuff - and new characters ... well new in the sense that in some cases you get a character that otherwise only pops up in the third movie. But the whole thing makes more sense that way.If you listen to the old commentaries (which are fun and plenty), they do talk about DVDs - if you are baffled: they are discs that look like Blu Rays or 4K discs ... but had way less capacity on them ... also a weaker overall image and sound. But while that part may not have aged well - the movie itself has aged well - it really looks good to say the least. And if you are into Fantasy movies ... well the only thing that remains to be answered: you want to read the books first if you haven't or dive into this? Of course then there is also the new Prime show - which I will dive into sometime in the future."
tt0848228,"An article I read summed up The Avengers as ""The Anti-Dark Knight,"" which is NOT a bad thing. It's just about as quality, but rather than being dark and gritty, this movie is fun with hilarious, yet intelligent dialogue. This is the truest comic book film. No, we're not given a bad pun about the villain's costume in the middle of really intense scenes. The movie is intense, intelligent, hilarious, and fun, which is a very odd combo for a movie one would expect to be very Hollywood.This movie spits in the faces of more serious movie-watchers. Even they will get absorbed into this movie for many reasons. Usually, in a Hollywood movie with the success this one was expected to accumulate, you'd see more sex and idiots on screen twisting the plot in the most ridiculous of ways. Well, Scarlett Johansson is not used for seduction on other characters or sexual appeal to viewers. She is here to play Black Widow and be a crucial part of the film! As for idiots, there are none. The characters in this movie are all smart and necessary to the story. All of them do a great job! Even Mark Ruffalo, whose presence will make you forget the great Norton was even the Hulk first.The story is just about as well-balanced as one could hope for between intelligence, action, tension, and flow. The characters' backgrounds are all tied together very well, and the story isn't centered around one character too much more than another. The main characters all get equal screen time and importance to the movie's monumentally huge and intelligent plot. For those who complain we're not given enough depth on characters, we were given a good amount of depth. If we would've gone any more in depth on any one of the characters, the flow of the movie would've succeeded less. We see enough from everyone.To cap this movie off, the action was superb! It's always exciting anytime there is fighting sequences, which are plentiful. The special effects are really well-done, which is expected from a movie with such a budget as this one had to work with. The money was all put to good use. Great action, great actors, great directing, great plot, great dialogue, great movie!!The only complaints one could have is ""They didn't stick with the comic books"" or ""These guys weren't the original Avengers."" This is a film. You cannot directly copy a comic exactly when making a comic book movie. It's a movie. It stands alone. Other complaints are just a few bad lines that are easily pardoned with how much the rest of the script outweighs the few bad lines.This movie spits in the faces of serious movie-watchers. It surely did in mine. I didn't think I'd come across a movie with such an ominous plot in which the manner of the characters isn't totally serious. This is the one great film that was able to do that and still maintain a level of greatness that it does. This is one of the greatest 2000's films. I rank it right up there with The Dark Knight, Return of the King, City of God, Inception, etc. One of the greats of our time."
tt0108052,"Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox."
tt1130884,"Guess who praised Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island""? Roger Ebert! The cinematography, the spooky atmosphere, the film noir's overtones, the whole psychological torment, the ""buried trauma"" to quote him, as so many voices speaking in favor of ""Shutter Island"", another great achievement from the greatest director of his generation.Marty might be the greatest as the most consistent director of the New Hollywood generation but I hate how 'great Marty film' started working like a pleonasm, as to underline a tacit rule that any movie made by a great film-maker automatically deserves the benefit of the doubt, in other words: if you hate it, you didn't get it. I'm sorry again, but the director who committed this cinematic piece of unoriginality is not the passionate artist who enriched cinema with so many masterpieces, like ""Mean Streets"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"" and such delightful little gems like ""The King of Comedy"" or ""After Hours"". I'm sorry but Marty didn't gain in maturity, not even in craftsmanship, he purely and simply ¬Ö lost his touch.I have the biggest respect for Scorsese, and also for Ebert, and the reason I mentioned the latter is because he's certainly Scorsese's number one fan, but he's also one of these privileged persons who've seen so many movies in his life that he would be the least likely to get so easily impressed by a film, that blatantly exploits every single cinematic clich√©, considering the story's material. The movie is so 'obvious' that it would be tragic if it wasn't so laughable. And it's obvious because it works on that reverse effect, as movie fans, we know that whatever seems obvious in the first act will probably be contradicted. True BUT whatever seems obvious is exactly the opposite of what is shown during that very first act, because we know we're being tricked by the director. In that case, it's like Scorsese was the 'sprinkled sprinkler', and Ebert's implicit denial of the script obviousness says a lot about his recurrent loss of subjectivity whenever it concerns Scorsese.I don't want to number all the clich√©s: the two detectives investigating, the entrance in the island with a haunting atmosphere emphasized by an ominous music, begging you to be scared, or impressed, a weird feeling of unrealism in some backgrounds that made me question what the artistic approach was, let's just call it 'homage' to old-school cinema, this one never gets old. But I wouldn't have expected this emphasis on the tone, screaming ""Beware ¬Ö danger"" not even from old-school directors, and certainly not from Hitchchock. Okay, we got the idea that something will go wrong; it doesn't even trust our patience as Di Caprio acts weirdly from the very first scenes. I was pleased by Ben Kingley's performance as the charming head doctor, but it's getting old since Nurse Ratched and I didn't mention Fritz Lang, because there are less risks that he might be known by the targeted audience.And I'm not even implying that the movie is not worth watching, but it plays like an overlong build-up for a weak climax, a build-up, during which nothing very pleasing happens. And I mean 'pleasing' in the pleasing meaning of the word, seriously. What happened to Marty's sense of entertainment? Why such a constant need to be dark, Gothic and gloomy? Is that Cinema's new emotional trend? Are we supposed to endure this atmosphere during the whole picture? Can't we have a break? a distracting element, not necessarily a comic relief, but I don't know, a subplot, an interesting character, even Hitchcock did it¬Öno, again, the time-filler relied on the guilty trauma, the good old theme so cherished by Marty, and that provides the best alibis to rationalize his films. And we discover his wife played by a beautiful Michelle Thomas, and some horrific flashbacks featuring the Nazi's atrocities, always a good taste to combine the supernatural horror with the real one, that's what the movie needed in case we thought we would cheer up at the end. Or was he just surfing on an opportunistic wave introduced by Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds""?The weaknesses of the plot canceled out all the cinematographic attempts to justify the movie's cinematic merit. Nothing special happens, nothing really happens, and again, it's so damn hard to feel sympathetic toward Leonardo Di Caprio! Yes, I have a big problem with Di Caprio in Scorsese's film, because of that same constipated face he has to display, to remind us that he's playing a tough guy. Did Bogart look tough? Di Caprio is a good actor, even great sometimes, but this is becoming one of his most annoying trademarks. I miss the young, lively Di Caprio with sparkling eyes and youthful look, because tough he isn't, and he doesn't fool anyone, and this is probably why the only Marty's movie I thought he delivered a great and flamboyant performance was ""The Aviator"". The first thing I see in a Di Caprio film now, is the poster, tough-guy-constipated-face? I avoid.An indigestible film with a risible attempt to scare us, I will stop here because I'm tired of being so critical about the director whom I praised most of his work from the 70's to the 90's. But he just doesn't do justice to his glorious filmography, Scorsese is a man of gripping realism of psychological torture and it doesn't need a supernatural flavor to taste good, it's scarier when real and more than that, Scorsese is a damn entertainer, with a unique talent of storyteller, and not only the story isn't told well, but it's not even a good story, as far as originality is concerned.And when comes the final scene, with the final line, supposed to summarize the whole message of the film and justify the whole build-up, my only reaction was : ""so, we got from that ¬Ö to that?!"" and this is my exact feeling when I compare between Marty's earlier and later works."
tt1130884,"Teddy is refusing to accept the fact that he killed his wife after she murdered their children and has become delusional and violent.

tt0111161,"People look for all sorts of things in movies, and you can see it in the occasional negative review that pops up for this movie.  Some viewers are looking for gritty realism in everything on the screen.  Others are action junkies.  Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce moviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest shot, or the niftiest angle.  For all of these, there is the very real chance that they simply will not ""get"" this film, and that's too bad -- they are missing out on a classic.At its best, film can transcend merely being a series of pictures, no matter how pretty, and can reach down and touch people.  That is where Shawshank succeeds so brilliantly.  It is not the fastest moving movie, not the edgiest, not the grittiest, it is filmed in shades of gray.  But this movie absolutely sings with human spirit, and captures an universal human theme as well as any movie has ever done.  And THAT is filmmaking at its finest.  Not a game, not eye candy -- this movie stays with you long after the credits have rolled."

tt0361748,"Reviewing ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a moral dilemma. I know it has everything to please the fans, it's entertaining, masterfully directed and edited, and features memorable characters portrayed by a big-star cast, and the whole film is carried by one of the greatest supporting and villainous performance of the last ten years. Christoph Waltz, as Hans Landa, is an unforgettable character, magnetic even in one blink or a crazy smirk. But this is a supporting performance, not enough to redeem the film.""Inglourious Basterds"" is the living proof that Tarantino lost his touch. The ""Kill Bill"" series is a masterpiece of movie homage, something that worked because you could feel that Tarantino made this film with his heart, he grew up with Asian Kung-Fu films, and made a masterpiece out of it. But now, why does he feel the need to rely all his movies on that concept? After the drive-in B-movies in ""Death Proof"" which beyond the action, was just an exercise of testosterone stimulation, and a tentative to resurrect Kurt Russel's character as he did for Travolta, I started thinking Tarantino was slipping. But I didn't take the movie that seriously and I thought even Tarantino is allowed to loosen up a bit, and please the fans of the genre, with a fun to watch and well-crafted action flick.But now, we have a film nominated in the Cannes' festival, in many glorious competitions, including the Oscars. It's something presented as a new ""Pulp Fiction"", so the movie takes itself so seriously before its release, it deserves a serious and honest critic ¬Ö and all I can say is that I will probably never get the love for ""Inglourious Basterds"", a film where Tarantino caricatures himself, disguising barbarity and cruelty under the fallacious legitimacy of fighting the quintessential evil enemy, the Nazis. Done intelligently, it could have been an interesting film, but in this world where violence is preached by fanatics and fantasized by lunatics, this is (despite Waltz and his hilarious Italian scene) an irresponsible film whose plot twist made it even more dangerous, as it conveyed the dangerous message that this was the way it should have been done, therefore, this is the way WE should treat our enemies.And if violence, even in the cruelest and barbaric form is legitimated when you fight evil, you've got to question yourself about the meaning of that word. Is it right to carve a swastika in a soldier's forehead to condemn him for perpetual shame when he was just doing his duty. Were we supposed to cheer during the scalping? Or the scene where an officer's head was reduced to a pulp with a baseball bat? Were we supposed to cheer when Diane Kruger's character shot the guy she had just guaranteed his safety, or the soldier who was mercilessly shot at the end and then inevitably scalped? These scenes made me nauseous and hating the movie because it just encouraged the most odious and dangerous racist fantasies, in such a patronizing way, I wonder how come no fan felt insulted.This is a dangerous film, definitely glorifying violence by making it cool, bad-ass, and legitimate just because there's something ""naturally"" evil in the enemy, and it's not just violence, it's the graphicness, the cold-blooded horrific way of killing, and the fact that it's supposed to make people clap and enjoy the gruesomeness ... this is an irresponsible case of glorifying violence, and the script's biggest flaw. I guess the Shoshanna's subplot was a way to inject the eternal revenge story, supposedly the heart of the film. But for some reason, the actress didn't touch me, she was playing it too cool and aggressive, and the part that definitely killed the character was the glamorous sequence that looked more like an advertisement for cosmetics than anything else. Shosanna who witnessed the killing of her family, behaves like some kind of sexy James Bond girl. Probably not bad acting, but a too coldly artificial writing to be believable.(And if a great performance can't redeem a film I guess, a bad one can also ruin it... like the guy who played the projectionist, Marcel, his delivery of lines was so laughable I wonder if Tarantino was really behind the camera when it was shot)Now, I know the fans will over-analyze the film talking about its self-referential aspect, our approach to violence, a great homage to classic war films and I must concede that when I watched the opening scene, I thought it would be a masterpiece, but this 'homage' thing must stop now, it's okay for one or two scenes, but basing the whole movie structure on that has been a little bit overused by Tarantino ... it's time now to come with something more original, and less irresponsible.I say 'irresponsible' because Tarantino became like a cinematic label, as if any of his movies would automatically please the fans, I don't mean this as an insult, Tarantino was my favorite director five years ago, I've always thought the guy defined ""coolness"" in films, he was for me the-coolest-director-in-the-world and whatever he made, said and touched, was cool and entertaining. That's why I think this movie is irresponsible, because Tarantino uses his undeniable talent and creativity to communicate an extremely dangerous message, and many of his younger fans will think it's cool and bad-ass to scalp the evil enemy, because Tarantino said so, and Brad Pitt did it.To conclude, ""That's NOT a bingo!"" and the popularity of this film is revealing of a very sad reality where movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" are considered as one of the greatest war films ever, and ""Inglourious Basterds"" praised as a masterpiece, even by Tarantino, in his pretentious closing lines ¬Ö a movie I expected to like, and I ended up hating it with intensity."
tt0114369,"As the title of the movie suggests , there are 7 sins and watching a masterpiece ain't one of them. This movie has everything,a wonderful and a talented cast, a great director and the center of it,a story. It has a Gothic horror movie vibe to it but at the core it's a psychological thriller.This movie isn't for the faint-hearted as it contains a few disturbing scenes."
tt0429078,"All the negative critics read on this site just gave me a big laugh... This truly masterful film of Tsui Hark contains more powerful scenes than the majority of the films I've seen in these last five years. When I read somewhere someone even daring to say that this film has not any soul and depth, I wanted to cry... How can anyone neglecting the unrelenting power coming from the magnificent visual compositions and framing and clever editing as much as the intensity of the acting performances by Donnie Yen, Sun Hong Lei, Charlie Young or Zhang Jingchu; the constant impacts on our all senses by the exhaustive scenes filled with an incredible amount of love and sensuality equally paralleled by the peace, honesty and responsibility, that are conversely also contradicted by the violence, hate and greediness. In its entire complexity of the indispensable sub-plots (that i figure are supposed to be the driving force behind the whole series) and colorful characters all the heroic themes are given more intensity and such a greatness that one would hardly find even in ""The Magnificent Seven"" or ""Seven Samurai"". The whole narrative structure and the cinematic presentation speaks volumes of the genius of Tsui Hark's that never yields to the artificial and commercial tone and appeal of Zhang Yimou's sell-out efforts. A very unusual narration is not so extraordinary as the depth of the approached themes and the emotional power of the film (due to the multiplications of the characters and sub-plots, therefore make their own space in the film, just for the inner feelings of the characters and their interactions) making ""Seven Swords"" one of the most intelligent and unforgettable films of Tsui Hark's career. Add to it a very reassured touches of the majestic beauty probably last seen in the films sometime in the 70's, and you have one of the essential films of the year 2005 and one of if not Tsui Hark's biggest achievement ever. If you want to see the true Wuxia film, and i mean the Wuxia as is supposed to look like in its truest form, watch this masterpiece. Don't listen to anyone who badmouths this film, they have absolutely no idea what they're talking about, and what's even more hilarious that all of their comments start with a ridiculous line how they watched many Chinese movies as if it would all of a sudden gave them any more credibility or what, they could have seen thousands and thousands of movies but it'd be absolutely pointless because many people can guarantee you that no one has seen before anything resembling the breath-taking majestic quality of ""Seven Swords"", this is a spiritualistic heroic movie that has more soul and depth than any movie made in the last decade or even more...Finally to put it in a nutshell. Let me tell you that Seven Swords is a revelation for eyes of a moviegoer, a magnificent film of beauty and violence with breathtaking moments that might be stuck in your mind forever. I'm happy as you that we're possibly talking about a milestone of Chinese cinema and Tsui Hark's long career. He made what he wanted to and to tell you the truth i'm not interested in any other longer version of this movie now. It'd only spoil this otherwise absolutely perfect enough film.""That's what the ""MOVIES"" are about"" is the first i uttered at the end credits that had me otherwise sitting silent and speechless."
tt1345836,"As ""The Dark Knight Rises"" opens - picking up eight years after the events chronicled in ""The Dark Knight"" - we find eccentric billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a rather depressed state of mind. He has essentially withdrawn from the world, given up his crime-fighting ways and hung up his Batman cape, having largely fallen out of favor with the citizens of Gotham City who see him less as a hero and more as an out-of-control killer. Only his loyal servant/father-figure, Albert (the venerable Michael Caine), cares enough to give him a swift kick in the rear-end every now and again to try to get him to move on with his life. All this changes, however, when the fascistic Bane comes to town, a figure so consummate in his villainy that he is willing to blow up the whole blasted metropolis with an atomic bomb if he doesn't get what he wants.Though Christopher Nolan's latest entry in the series is nowhere near as engaging or as gripping as the previous two (especially the second), the movie attains a certain historical and contemporary significance with its echoes of both the French Revolution and Occupy Wall Street, though, oddly, the movie seems intent on putting us on the wrong side of history in both cases (rooting for a corrupt status quo and against a grass-roots uprising against that corruption).And, let's face it, Heath Ledger's Joker - one of the richest villains in all of movie history - would be a hard act for anyone to follow, and Tom Hardy's Bane, even with his mask and amplified voice, seems a mite tame in comparison. On his own terms, however, Bane is reasonably effective, if only because of the implacable nature of his evil, which manifests itself in his willingness to sacrifice masses of innocent people to enrich his own power.Thanks partly to the muddled politics and partly to the overstuffed nature of the storytelling, the movie never finds a way to fully engage its audience in the world it's created. In fact, in comparison to the narrative sturdiness of its two predecessors, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" comes across as a bit of a messy affair overall, with subplots spinning off in all directions, with little gravity at the core to bind it all together. A case in point: while Anne Hathaway brings a degree of flirtatious charm to the role of cat burglar-turned-Cat Woman, the character as a whole seems like an afterthought, tacked onto the story to provide some counter-balancing romantic interludes for the sullen, all but monastic Wayne.The cast is rounded out by Gary Oldman, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Aaron Eckhart and others, but, more so than in the two previous entries in the series, the real stars of ""The Dark Night Rises"" turn out to be the visual pyrotechnics and special effects."
tt0110912,"This is worth seeing 1-2 times as it was fresh and innovative when it came out 10+ years ago. Tarantino certainly can write terrific dialogue. Walken, Roth and a couple of others are good. There are some beautiful scenes eg. the dance contest.By the time he got to Pulp Fiction, Tarantino had become self-conscious and, more important, had fooled himself into thinking that he had something deep to convey.Pulp Fiction is all hip and clever and fast and cool. It - any Tarantino movie really - laughs at movie conventions, characters, plots, story lines, scenes, and acting itself. In this he's following Burt Reynolds, who parodied his own roles and laughed at his own movies until he himself became a joke.When you watch Pulp Fiction you either buy into it or you don't. If you buy in, it's probably awesome (or at least better than the Kill Bill cr*p). But if you stand back a little bit it's just Hollywood behind an ultra-hip mask and like TV: slick & glossy but paper thin.After hearing much about this, we saw it not long after it came out. Easily the biggest disappointment ever in actual:hype ratio. This movie should rate 6/10 but is downgraded because of raised expectations.In complaining about it, a friend explained that to truly appreciate Pulp Fiction you had to understand that the briefcase contained Marsellus Wallace's soul, and that Jackson was an angel, and various other important insights.That's it then: as with any great movie, it just needed to be explained."

tt7286456,"Is Joker the worst comic book movie I ever saw? Oh yes beating Batman and Robin.( Phoenix surpassed the worst comic book performance of all-time by Alicia Silverstone ( Batgirl)). Perhaps I am not sophisticated enough to get the movie, but I found it unpleasant ( except for the Sinatra music and the setting). I do not care for Arthur/Joker and did not have one speck of sympathy for him Why? For one his goal is not to make things better, it is about anarchy ( unlike say what we saw in V is for Vendetta). Spoilers ahead: Who people should feel for is young Bruce Wayne who sees his parents murdered in cold blood in front of him. There is nothing funny about seeing a child orphaned. As far as movies are concerned, I enjoyed Ledger and Nicholson as Joker, and I also liked him in comics and cartoons. Why? He is the perfect counterpoint to Batman, and vice versa.. Batman almost never laughs and Joker ( rarely) cries. This is a movie of hopelessness and depression, that makes you feel things cannot possibly get better. While Batman is the Dark Knight and that name alone says he not a fun loving character with wisecracks like Spider-Man, his presence in Gotham City gives hope of a better future ( something not seen in Joker). A very unpleasant experience that got me angry. I did not like the movie. 0/10 stars."

tt1130884,"In 1954, the Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) from Seattle travel by ferry to the Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of the patient Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), who drowned her three kids, from the mental institution for dangerous criminals Ashcliffe Hospital. Teddy is veteran WWII soldier traumatized by the war experience in the liberation of the Duchan concentration camp and the loss of his beloved wife in a criminal fire. Teddy is unable to access the records of employees and patients and feels that his investigation is obstructed by the management by the Federal facility. Teddy has severe migraines and when there is a storm, Teddy and Chuck find that they are stranded in the island. Teddy interviews the internees, discovers that one is missing and follows a lead to the lighthouse, where he discloses the mystery about the sixty-seventh patient of the Shutter Island.""Shutter Island"" is a good but predictable psychological thriller. The production has a high budget and consequently a great cast, costumes, locations and special effects. However, the major twist when Teddy Daniels finds the truth about the Shutter Island and himself is not a surprise. In this regard, ""Identity"" and ""Haute Tension"" for example, work better and better and really surprise the viewer after the plot point. Further, the IMDb Rating Top 250: #246 is absolutely overrated. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Ilha do Medo"" (""Island of the Fear"")Note: On 05 September 2023, I saw this film again."
tt0372784,"Batman begins is the beginning of an era of all around bad movies. Bad acting, bad directing and bad writing. Did anyone else notice batman had only one expression, the blank gaze. Except when he was really angry, that warranted a shaking jaw. His low, ""I am Batman"" voice got increasingly gruff throughout the movie, to no benefit whatsoever. His interrogation routine was severely flawed, what with the administration of insanity gas prior to shouting clich√©d questions, to a now incoherent being. His defense mechanism was to jump off buildings at any sign of danger, and he couldn't even manage to lift a log of himself, despite the adrenaline that should be coursing through his veins, without the encouragement of Alfred. To top it all off, Batman was just a tool in general, wiping out hordes of innocent people for the sake of petty revenge. I miss the good old days, when superheroes weren't required to let angst affect their every move, driving included. Bring back the Batmobile, that hunk of machinery was a pathetic replacement for some long lost masculinity. All in all, the highlight of the film, and some of the best acting, was the hobo.End rant."
tt1375666,"Warning: spoiler alert:After watching Inception I have this question to ask: The movie played with the idea, that we can't always tell the difference between a dream and reality. Sometimes when dreaming, we realize, that we dream and that helps us awake. Other times, we don't realize that we are dreaming and then we are stuck in the dream. The question, which everybody ask themselves is: Did Cobb awake at the end of the movie or did he kept dreaming? I would like to ask this: DOES IT MATTER? Because through the two hours, I didn't get any background of this guy. I don't know who he is, what he likes to do, where are his faults, what are his hopes for the future. I am not even sure if he has a wife- and if he does, if Mal exists, then I don't know anything about her too. Not to mention their supposedly small children. My point is: This movie didn't have any story, didn't have any heart, didn't have any life in it. All characters were just figures, with no background and no emotional structure. So what do I care about Cobb, or his wife, or his mission? Because I don't even know what his mission was- to make the Asian guy even richer? And if you think it is so wonderful, that the movie didn't gets any straight answers, let me tell you this: the movie doesn't even ask a question. It doesn't make you think, because, at the end of it- there is no story behind it. There is no moral dilemma, there is no character development. And I feel really sorry for Leonardo Dicaprio - who started as a very promising actor, but somewhere in the way decided to act important and pretend to be smart. First he made The Blood Diamond- a very good movie. Then he made 11th Hour- a very good environmental movie. And then he went vacationing with Naomi Campbell on an yacht. What better way to prove that you believe in what you preach? Don't make the mistake to believe Inception has anything to offer, but some false sense of self importance."
tt0172495,"Great Story!  Great Writing!  Great Acting!  Great Directing!  Great Score! This movie has it all.  I especially enjoyed the mood of the film.  Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style.  The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations.  Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the ""general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor.""  Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus.  Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine.  It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla.  However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles.  Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers.  Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators.  The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the ""thrill of the Coliseum"" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate.  The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene.  But the whole movie is a rush!  Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie.  Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing.  I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages.  Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time!"
tt0816692,"Christopher Nolan seems to draw a buzzing mass of Nolan-fanatics wherever he goes. These little buzzers swarm around The Light That Is Nolan and in His light, nothing can ever go wrong. Who cares if Bane's death in The Dark Knight Rises was ridiculous? It's Nolan, he's amazing, God sent his cute little pout to earth to bless our sorry asses, and have you seen his¬Ö¬Ö (Aaaaand here we wander into dangerous territory.)Okay I get it, Memento was ingenious, The Dark Knight set new standards for the superhero-scope of the cinema-verse, but Nolan sure doesn't have the Midas hand of movie-making. He's a man, he makes mistakes, and not all of the stuff he makes turns out so fabulous.Hence the reason for the lame pun of this post: Nolan's latest film, Interstellar, wasn't as stellar as the name suggests.Sure, Interstellar has fancy technology, as its Oscar for Best Visual Effects will demonstrate. The most accurate portrayal of a wormhole, precision of orbital physics and astrophysics, (insert fancy jargon here)All that's great, except that there's more to a movie than just technical splendor.Stanley Kubrick's science fiction masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey isn't considered one of the greatest sci-fi films ever created only for its revolutionary techniques in portraying space and spaceships; its profound ruminations of the nature of man and the questions it raises on the divide between natural and artificial intelligence are what has put the film on the pinnacle of cinema. Of course, the movie's amazing sequences of spaceships moving slowly in harmony with Strauss's majestic pieces cannot be overlooked, but that does not mean they are the sole reason behind A Space Odyssey's critical acclaim.Interstellar tries valiantly to mimic both the technical and philosophical marvels of historical sci-fi films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, yet it fails by a long shot in delivering a significant, poignant message. The early scenes between Murph and Cooper fall flat in emotion; neither the acting nor the dialog carry through the fragile emotions that should have been exchanged in such a scene. Nolan's efforts to raise questions on the ""human identity"" are easily spotted in scenes that seem almost forced, with little contextual connection to the sequence of events that move the story forward. The best example would be Anne Hathaway's excruciatingly cringe-worthy scene in which she claims love is worth jeopardizing their whole mission and the future of humanity for. Seriously, this comes out of nowhere‚Äîwhen did Hathaway's character become so irrational and obsessed with her probably long-dead lover?""Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends time and space,"" she cries. Sound like something from one of those turn-your-life-around-through-these-10-steps books? It's unbelievably sloppy and unrealistic dialogue, and something I'm not at all surprised to find in a Nolan movie. Self-important, philosophic textbook quotes may work in a superhero movie where the hero is expected to be somewhat presumptuous, but not so much for a supposedly realistic science fiction flick.What I've concluded is that Interstellar is neither unique nor special; its ideas of travel through wormholes and warped time in different areas of the galaxy have already been entertained in science fiction films of an earlier age such as Star Trek. The only factor that Interstellar can show off above all other is the accuracy to which it incorporated modern theories of space and time‚Äî the wormhole's curved surface is supposedly the most accurate representation of such a thing ever put on screen.Perhaps the supposed scientific genius of the movie becomes more real to its audience because of the background of the movie, or the way the subject of space travel is treated. Science fiction movies like Star Trek seem far off from reality‚Äîsuch movies portray themselves as fiction, a made up world, a world that is usually beyond the parameters of a ""what if"" world that diverges from our own. Interstellar, however, tries to make itself seem like an extension of the reality we live in‚Äîour future very well may have in store for us a dry, bleak land that has forsaken the human race. Dying potato fields and giant dust storm seem less childlike, less like a figment of our imagination than do light sabers and evil warlords waging war on the galaxy. We are led to empathize with the world of Interstellar as if it were our own and not a created fantasy land, which is why some of the things that happen in the movie seem less absurd than what happens in other films of the same genre (of course, these ""things"" exclude the infamous bookshelf and Morse code scene, the absolute bane of the movie and the epitome of Christopher Nolan's over-ambition with his newest project).So if you thought Interstellar was an absolute blast, good for you. Congratulations for spending those extra dollars on watching IMAX 3D or whatever it is they have these days. Next time though, you might want to consider crashing on your couch with a nice, homemade bowl of buttery popcorn and let Netflix lead you through the world of true, time-proved science fiction. (Of course, Interstellar re-runs are always available. Respect personal preference I must.)"

tt0108052,"The story of Oskar Schindler, adapted from Thomas Keneallay's book 'Schindler's Ark', was brought to the screen by Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson gives a strong and powerful performance in the lead role, bringing a dignity and gravitas to the man who saved the people on his list from certain death at the hands of the Nazis.The film is in black and white, with the exception of the red dress of a small girl we follow in the Jewish ghetto, and a real-life coda at the end where the people saved by Schindler pay their respects to him. Was Schindler a great man, a humanitarian, or motivated by gain and greed? The film seems firmly in the first camp and in its other characters portrays certain stereotypes - the sensitive Jew played by Ben Kingsley, the sadistic SS man played by Ralph Fiennes.It doesn't flinch from showing the worst of the Holocaust, and rightly so. But - as the story unfolds and the small amount of people on the list are saved - there is hope within the unspeakable terrors of anti-Semitic propaganda. Along with 'The Color Purple', this is Spielberg's strongest work."
tt0816692,"A long, tedious movie. It attempts to be an epic but fails. It attempts to say something profound, but the message is garbled. The movie attempts to mix jumbled pseudo-scientific dialogue with a melodramatic subplot involving a father and daughter, producing a muddled story with little dramatic power. The movie contains elements from 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Matrix, with its bombastic musical flourishes and the special effects meant to depict extra-dimensionality, all pure Hollywood. Matthew McConaughey is the principal actor; his character, Cooper, is the central figure of the story; the rest of the cast are supporting characters (their placement in the credits notwithstanding). McConaughey gives an interesting performance, which includes several scenes in which he weeps, which for a leading man is remarkable. The depiction of earth as a doomed planet is unconvincing and the plan to colonize other planets half-baked and one that tests the limits of plausibility. Being a science-fiction movie, stretching the boundaries of science for literary purposes is to be expected, but this movie asks the audience to accept certain premises that just do not make sense (e.g, acceleration of time; relationship of time to gravity; time as a material object). This movie is proof that when Hollywood attempts to deal with time warps, time holes, multi-dimensionality, relativity, and other complex scientific theories, the results can be less than optimum."
tt0111161,"I've heard about this movie for a long time, people talking about it; making references from this movie. I searched about it and it has a 9. Imdb score and I decided to watch it.It's an okay movie. The cinematography is good, the characters are kind of likeable. However within the first 15 minutes I cringed at the voice over of Morgan Freeman about how great Andy was, how he likes him right away... There are many more scenes that I cringed, like when they drink beer on the rooftop and Andy sitting there smiling and everybody's smiling. And the scene with the music and everybody stops doing everything and looking up. I guess there are some scenes that I like, the first part when the overweight man was beaten to death was good and I really feel bad for him; also the part the rock n roll kid got shot; I genuinely thought he was going to be given a chance ( because of how positive this movie feels to me) so when he got shot I thought:""Wow some reality"".The ending didn't inspire me at all.

tt0120737,"I had begun watching The Lord of the Rings because of all the memes and references in other movies and shows. And that was probably an excellent decision. It has been a year since I have watched these and since the story is distributed among all the three movies, I have decided that I will talk about something unique each of them. In total these movies clock over 10 hours, and I can imagine how much the fans of the book must have loved it when they learnt they are getting so much content from a book they love reading so much.The Fellowship of the Ring is the very first one of the movies which basically kickstarts the adventure. It is amazing to see how much content this movie has in spite of the fact that the entire backstory was narrated in the first two minutes of the beginning. There are a lot of things to talk about in this. The movie created a font style, a score and a colour palette that fits along with the scenes of the battle that made it look so suspenseful. As the scene was going on I was very attentive to hear everything that happens throughout. And this was just the first two minutes of the 3 hour movie.Afterwards the scene transitioned to the otherwise peaceful Hobbiton. It was a very interesting transition, that showed how on one hand the races are fighting each other for getting control over the Middle Earth, while on the other hand there are a bunch of peace loving Hobbits who are just into their day to day lives. They always have very wholesome reactions when they see Gandalf, which is the reason why it creates a stark contrast from what is about to happen after they leave Hobbiton. Although Bilbo was a good friend of Gandalf and Gandalf had come all the way to celebrate his birthday, he didn't feel that Bilbo was a trustworthy person because he was also attached to the ring. As a result he decided to send his nephew Frodo, his friend Sam and two other Hobbits to help dispose of the ring.The ring is also something I'd like to talk about here, since it is in this movie that the ring and its effects have been talked about the most. The ring is something that appeals to anyone who has desires, but once it is worn it ends up tormenting the wearer. The subtle message that this sends us is the consequence of a moment's greed. Not everyone has the ability to hold their temptation, which is the reason why the Hobbits are specifically sent to dispose of it. Frodo himself has the urge to wear it twice, the reason being that he wanted to save himself. At one moment he wears it accidentally during a bar fight, which makes him see the Eye of Modor and makes him vulnerable. If one is able to get over their desires and focus on what makes their life easy, there will be no need of such temptations. This is what the ring tells us.And afterwards they go to Rivendell, which is, simply said, the most beautiful place I have ever seen in my whole life in any movie! Over there they create The Fellowship of the Ring, which goes to destroy the ring in the lava at the Mountain of Doom. Now I won't get too much into the story since I want to keep this review spoiler-free, so I'm just gonna talk about how beautiful all the scenes from this movie are. Seeing them reminded me of my childhood, reading nursery rhymes and fairy tales. I always looked at the pictures and imagined this is what those places must have looked like. Every location from this movie looks like it could be one of those 19th century paintings. It's amazing to see such places are still left in this world that have not been destroyed as of yet.The movie, or should I say the trilogy, has really gone hard with the details. They chose to make the maps, the fonts, the detailed lore, all the cities from the Middle Earth and even the easter eggs which added a lot of lore to the movie. Every scene from the movie looks like a painting, which is not something which can be said about most adventure fantasy movies. It has the feeling of an RPG game to it, or at least that's how I feel it. It's something of a Skyrim of all movies. For the fans this must have felt like a dream coming true. Things like these should be made for all fantasy movies, which have begun looking underworked simply because of the existence of this movie.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is not a movie that I may want to watch again because of how long it was and the fact that it is nothing in itself unless the other two parts are also combined, but this is also for a good thing because of the fond memories that this movie has left for me. Personally this was the most memorable movie for me among the trilogy. It was because of how rich and detailed this movie was that gave me the confidence of watching the other two movies as well, something I rarely do otherwise. There are many iconic movies like The Godfather, Jurassic Park and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs which I did like, but they didn't give me the courage to continue. This is going to be one of those classical movies that I'd remember for life."

Will take you through a string of emotions as you watch, which is good.Although the movie is long, the pacing was good so you don't feel bored at all. Don't need me to say it but definitely would recommend."
tt0108052,"It appears that the comments by IMDB users have to be every bit as black-and-white as the plot of the average Hollywood production? A film has to be either outstanding or miserable?Sorry, can't comply. I recommend Schindler's List to my friends on the basis of its beautiful photography and the outstanding performance by Ben Kingsley. I wouldn't have said that Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson do a great job. Charismatic though they both are, they just put on their usual stone faces for their respective parts.The film is definitely worth seeing, but I would argue that it's overrated all the same. Because... such an immoderate amount of praise has been heaped upon it. True, Spielberg's story about human kindness in adversity is a sweet and all-American story. But it doesn't have much to do with the black-in-black disaster that was the Holocaust."
tt1130884,"I'll start by saying that I did enjoy this film overall but there are a lot of really annoying aspects to it. First off is DiCaprio's stubble, which in 1954 would have made him a vagrant, not a US Marshall. Then there was the ridiculous music that accompanied an inconsequential scene of the marshals entering the asylum gates for the first time. It built up and built up, then nothing happened. That kind of thing is really annoying. The score overall veered from terrific to grating and inappropriate in places. I often found it quite distracting. There were many continuity problems throughout. If it was meant to add another dimension to the film, it failed. Instead it was distracting and gave the impression that they ran out of time/budget more than anything else. The plot is largely obvious from early on. If it takes you more than 15 minutes to work out what is going on, there is something wrong with you. OK, the full extent of the revelations at the end is harder to divine before it's revealed but the thrust of it is obvious. The film was, as you'd expect, beautifully shot and the cast was pretty good, although DiCaprio's Boston accent came and went at different times. The setting was also magnificent, which added to the overall effect. As a genre film, Shutter Island doesn't work nearly as well as others. Identity comes to mind as a far better attempt at the same kind of story. It's probable that it's strength is that it is not really a genre film and will, therefore, appeal to a broader audience. However, it is definitely not one of Scorcese's best. If I had to rank it, it would sit somewhere near Bringing Out the Dead."
tt1130884,"I like Martin Scorsesse a lot, and I was interested in seeing Shutter Island. It had a truly intriguing concept and my 17-year old sister was raving about how brilliant the film was. Shutter Island is not Scorsesse's best, but it was atmospheric, clever, incredibly thought-provoking and somewhat disturbing too.I do agree it is too long and that it drags in places, that Shutter Island is still very impressive and gripping. The cinematography is great, dark, expressionistic and Gothic. Same with the scenery which is both picturesque and bleak, while the direction is superb, almost operatic and imaginative. The screenplay is intelligent and the plot gripping and clever, however Shutter Island is one of those films that if you miss a line of dialogue or a plot point you are in danger of missing something important. I also liked the music- admittedly the repeated bass motif which has a knock-on-the-door effect makes us think immediately that something out of the ordinary is going to happen but I have to admit it was haunting, while the Mahler chamber music piece along with the more gut-wrenching images at Dacchau was put to effective use, though coming from a classical music enthusiast I never knew Mahler wrote chamber music.The acting is very good, Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley are both excellent, and Mark Ruffalo was surprisingly good too. Max Von Sydow is also good, and although I wasn't sure about Michelle Williams at first she was suitably eerie and haunting. Finally the ending, some have said it was clever, others were underwhelmed by it. For me, I found it very clever and it was actually the part of the film that made me think about most. Of course it leaves questions rather than answers, but I think that was the point, it is ambiguous and open to interpretation and I certainly would have never thought of that. There could also be the possibility that there is no right or wrong answer, we are left to wonder for ourselves whether he was sane or not, and I think that was a reason for why the film ended inconclusively- I for one asked myself what did happen to Ted?Overall, very gripping and clever, with an ending that really makes you think. It is not what I consider a perfect film, but the direction and acting makes up for any misgivings. Plus it is probably a film you need to see more than once to completely understand or appreciate it. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

Watch it for his story and the wonderful concept of an idea being a crime scene. this is heck of a good thriller... good.. this is the best of the best.

tt0361748,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" is an absolute blast, mixing sharp dialogue, intense action, and a whole lot of swagger. This movie rewrites history in the most Tarantino way possible, with a ragtag group of Jewish-American soldiers, led by Brad Pitt's hilariously over-the-top Lt. Aldo Raine, out to take down the Nazis.Pitt is a riot, delivering his lines with a thick Southern accent and a grin that says he's having way too much fun. But the real show-stealer is Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa. His performance is chilling, charming, and downright unforgettable. Every scene he's in crackles with tension.Tarantino's signature style is all over this film, from the snappy dialogue to the stylish cinematography. The opening scene alone is a masterclass in building suspense. And, of course, there's plenty of action and bloody revenge to keep things exciting.The movie also boasts a killer soundtrack, mixing in everything from spaghetti Western vibes to classic rock, giving the film a unique and eclectic feel. The ensemble cast, including M√©lanie Laurent, Eli Roth, and Michael Fassbender, all bring their A-game, making every moment memorable.""Inglourious Basterds"" is a must-watch for Tarantino fans and anyone who loves a good, wild ride through an alternate history. It's funny, thrilling, and packed with the kind of stylish flair that only Tarantino can deliver. If you're in the mood for something bold and badass, this is the movie for you."

tt1130884,"""Shutter Island"" is a schlocky, second-rate screenplay--which has the incredible good fortune of being directed by Martin Scorsese.A psychological thriller wasn't really what anyone expected from the acclaimed filmmaker, and although he sometimes feels lost in the unfamiliar genre, Scorsese lends a natural authenticity to the predictable plot and an earnestness to the would-be flat characters that salvages what might have been another ""Wolfman"" for something half-way memorable. And, hey, he won his Oscar. What better time to branch out?The problem with Scorsese's experiment is ultimately that it feels safe, which is half a function of an unremarkable script, and half his unfamiliarity in directing horror. He approaches the genre in the way a famous baker might prepare a steak‚ÄîHe goes back to the recipe. Sure, he sears some effectives sequences, with palpable suspense and unsettling visuals, but it's missing those hand-written notes in the margins that bring you back for seconds.His take on the story, while infinitely superior to, say, Joe Johnston's, still isn't quite ideal, and he seems to cling to the familiar whenever possible. He has a tendency to play up the noir element, with a fetishistic infatuation for the fifties period trench coats and fedoras that Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffolo sport, and for conversations punctuated by cigarettes, with a performance vocabulary that screams of the gangster flicks he's known for. That ""Shutter Island"" so clearly bears Scorsese's fingerprints is sort of the issue: a film about an insane asylum should be anything but predictable.But the director's successes should not be undermined either, and when ""Shutter Island"" works, it really works. For instance, DiCaprio as Marshall Teddy Daniels suffers from a particularly disturbing recurring flashback (compelling perhaps because it wasn't spoiled in the trailer) that features the young man as an Allied soldier liberating a Nazi concentration camp. The grotesque imagery of the war blends beautifully with the heady horror, and the cinematography is so sharp that one might wonder why Scorsese has never taken on a war film.Scorsese also achieves some masterfully atmospheric scenes on the island itself. He has a way of making the omnipresent hurricane a character, and the way the rain beats against the windows and leaks in during the night is subtly threatening, ratcheting up the intensity that he skillfully pays off in exteriors. These great moments are hardly lonely, but even the director's eerie visuals and tight pacing falter by the final third of ""Shutter Island's"" overlong 138-minute running time.The film becomes so suddenly talky and expository at its end that the whole thing almost capsizes under the weight. There is a twist, and you will likely understand it long before Scorsese is finished spoon-feeding you the solutions to each presumed non sequitur and tying up absolutely every loose end.But even though Scorsese is feeling his way through the dark in directing a modern psychological horror film, watching him work is still enjoyable, and I stress that the vast majority of the problems with ""Shutter Island"" on the screen are problems with ""Shutter Island"" on the page. Scorsese elevates the mediocre script into an above-average thriller that, if nothing else, is better than what's playing down the hall. Whether you enter as a fan of the genre or the director, ""Shutter Island"" is a palatable film. Just don't expect to be hungry for seconds."

tt0816692,"To this day , many people still talk a lot about Christopher Nolan's ""Batman""-trilogy, but here is his newest work: ""Interstellar"". He gets help from Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway again and a couple more familiar faces. One year after Cuar√≥n with Gravity, he discovers the endless widths of space as well. The difference, however is that a large part of his movie, including the first 40 minutes or so completely, plays down on Planet Earth. However, it is also about survival in space, including two people instead of one though. Or you could probably say the whole human race and not one individual fate.This is like our generation's ""Armageddon"", only that it is much better and much more edge-of-the-seat. The lead character is played by Matthew McConaughey, whose career is still on a massive high after numerous critically lauded performances and an Academy Award win. ""Interstellar"" is much more than Sci-Fi though. I personally found the film was at its best when it touched more the emotional relationships of the characters. The water planet sequence was incredibly well done. And right afterward, when Cooper (McConaughey) sees how his beloved family has aged and become parents, it is truly moving as well. I had a lump in my throat just like I did when he meets his very old daughter at the end of the movie. The inclusions with the old people telling about the past seem a bit odd at first, but make sense towards the end as we find out who is speaking there really.Then, I also had a love-hate relationship with the Matt Damon parts. I found it pretty boring to be honest initially, but when we found out about his true intentions, it quickly turns into one of the best parts of the film. Nicely done. When Caine's character mentioned him with high praise early on, I felt there could be something fishy (like with Pixar's Up) there and yes it was. The ending of the movie with Hathaway's character completely alone out there made me think maybe there will be a sequel. Saving Private... ehh I mean Dr. Brand. Who knows? The time during which the whole film plays is also interesting. Somehow, the NASA lost a lot of their reputation and the moon landing is called fake in American school books. It is some point in the future. That much we know. David Oyelowo plays a small role here as one of the teachers. He has ""Selma"" in the race for an Academy Award nomination this year.The ending of the film was not among the best scenes in my opinion, but I still liked it. The whole ghost explanation about Cooper being actually the one giving the signs was pretty exciting. The effects are brilliant of course, but that does not really need be mentioned for Nolan movies. A given. Hans Zimmer did a good soundtrack and there is also some comic relief coming from McConaughey's charm (if you like that) and some droll robot creatures. Anyway, I found the film interesting enough that I found it a bit sad they did not get to visit the third planet (with Hathaway's character's lover), only the water planet and the ice planet. I'd have loved to see that. However, maybe that could be a nice inclusion for a sequel as well. The movie never dragged despite coming pretty close to the three-hour mark. It could have run for another hour and I probably would not have been bored. There really was hardly anything wrong with it. Affleck's character did not do too much for me. He wasn't particularly well-acted and the character felt just included as a simple man who quickly gave up on his dad in order to show the contrast compared to Chastain's character: the ambitious loving smart daughter with a true connection to Cooper. John Lithgow plays a small role too and is fun to watch as always.This is one of the movies I really recommend to watch, preferably on the big screen due to its sensational visual aspects. It's also good for a rewatch I believe, also to evaluate the characters' actions, especially Caine's for example. And the story of course. I believe, after one viewing, I am still far away from having understood everything that was going on, especially the scientific aspects. That however, does not hurt the viewing experience at all thanks to the film's great acting and emotional impact. If you are interested in space, you really have to see this too. It has distant planets, wormholes, black holes, spaceships and a lot more. Let me finish this review with two little snippets: First, the actress who played Murph as a child was the same that played Renesmee in the last two Twilight movies and, secondly, that fittingly Hathaway's character was called Amelia like the aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart. That can't be coincidence, can it? Especially with her last shot."

tt0133093,"Tell me...what do you get when you take a bunch of computer nerds who have no concept of effective storytelling and put them into a room to make a movie...?  You get ""The Matrix""I hate this movie...and you wanna know why?  Because it serves no purpose. It's ""Dude, Where's my Car"" on steroids...louder, flashier, but not a bit more interesting.  The whole thing is based on special effects.  It's a film by two directors that think half of the cameras running at 300 fps is art...or something.Hugo Weaving has the only good performance in this movie as Agent Smith. Carrie Anne Moss is bland as can be.  Do I even have to comment on Keanu Reeves....dude...woah...nuff said.This is the perfect example of Joel Silver run amuck.  Just because you have money to produce movies, doesn't mean you should produce bad movies....sounds pretty obvious to me.  I'm just so thankful when I see someone like Steven Spielberg putting out a movie like Minority Report...a movie (actually...a director and crew) that knows how to USE special effects to drive a story.  Not just shoot the hell out of a government building...hmmmm...not such a great scene to slip in there now, huh?So, to everyone involved in The Matrix...give up your black leather, gun toting, world-is-an-illusion, horrible filmmaking and go put your money to good use...like film school."
tt0816692,"Just watched this on IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this before. It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think."
tt0120737,"An absolutely gorgeous adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's first LORD OF THE RINGS installment detailing how well-meaning young hobbit Wood unwittingly inherits a ring from his adventurous uncle Holm which possesses a dark force that is powerful enough to end all life in Middle-Earth. Visually wondrous even for those who aren't that into the fantasy genre. This installment is particularly charming for less action and more character development¬Ö and, for some reason, the Middle-Earth lingo works really well in this movie over the second and third films. Although FELLOWSHIP merely teases the viewer with the appearance of Gollum‚Äîwhile TWO TOWERS and RETURN are basically owned by Serkis as Tolkien's timelessly wretched creature who's not quite friend or foe‚Äîthe movie is just too lovable to really even need his inclusion. McKellen is perfect as Gandalf the Grey, and Bean's performance brings to the foreground the genius of all these characters who suffers from similar temptations and weaknesses that we do in reality. It is FELLOWSHIP that holds the clearest mirror up to us, while the following two films kind of just linger in the wartime aftermath. The greatest fantasy film of all-time.**** (out of four)"
tt0848228,"When I saw previews and commercials for this movie, I got really excited. I was a big fan of the old 70's Lou Ferrigno Incredible Hulk show. I loved Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk and the 2008 Hulk, so I knew Hulk would make a big impact on everyone who saw Avengers. Tony Stark was just flat out hilarious. 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger was not the greatest Marvel movie. I still liked Cap. America, but I just thought it was too in the 40's (kind of boring). I loved the Thor movie because there was great fun action in almost every scene (like the Avengers). The Avengers tops every Marvel movie I've ever seen and I can't wait for the September 25th Blu-ray/DVD release! I LOVE THE AVENGERS!! It might be hard for The Dark Knight Rises to top this film."
tt1130884,"Seriously, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, on several levels. The average rating of 8.0 astonishes me. OK, I evidently have to say more. Here goes - it starts out reasonable and interesting, then it gets weird. with lots of strange evidently psycho stuff going on, but it's just weird, not interesting, not thought provoking, difficult to follow, ... stupid you might say. It seems to be an all too predictable trap ... but then no, actually, I guess, the guy is crazy and it's all part of an elaborate ruse / therapy ... shazam. Wow, pathetic, not interesting, terrible, awful, tell me you like it seriously??? It's almost not possible. There, is my review long enough?"
tt7286456,"I can see how Warner Brothers would greenlight something like this in a heartbeat. And it was a box-office smash, so I guess they made the right decision. It's just that Joker is about as shallow as the pitch that must have been used to sell it.Take Joaquin Phoenix put him in a Taxi Driver world, give him a weird mom like Requiem for a Dream. Have the psycho want to be a comedian like King of Comedy. Ooh, ooh let's get DeNiro to play the Johnny Carson part. That'll be clever even though DeNiro is totally wrong for it. And do some kind of Bernie Goetz-but different! And have some kind of V for Vendetta-style revolution where everybody wears clown masks. Freaky huh?The picture goes about connecting these dots dutifully, accompanied by a two note kettle drum score that represents Arthur getting beaten down deeper and deeper. It also beats on the audience. There are several sequences that are apparently Arthur's daydreams and others that seem like daydreams but apparently aren't. These serve to break up the A to B to C plot and confuse the audience. The uprising happens because the whole town was celebrating a triple murder. But I guess they were protesting income inequality or something. Didn't make sense to me, but I am not part of the 16-34 male, superhero-movie-fan audience that this offering was aimed at.I watched to see Joaquin Phoenix chew the scenery. And for the 70s sets and cinematography, which were really good. But that's about all I got out of it. I feel old."
tt0172495,"The denizens of the Roman Empire were a particularly bloodthirsty lot, and apparently not that far off in mentality from our own culture. The vox populi, bored to the heavens with the multitudinous burdens inflicted on them by their government, seek escape in the mind-numbingly bland entertainment provided within the Colosseum. Gladiators fend for their lives against a series of uniquely dressed foes and beasts, all in the hope of winning their freedom. Everything about this testosterone-toned epic is meant to cater to a population who likes their filmed landscapes served to them WWF-style.Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a top army general in the army of Marcus Auerlius (Richard Harris), a dying patriarch who (in predictable fashion) unwittingly causes trouble within the family ranks by offering his throne to Maximus instead of to his son Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix). Auerlius' son is the kind of whinny, pussy-whipped boy that your audience likes to hate because the character's moral fiber makes the character so easily expendable. Commodus' temper tantrums lead to patricide and the film turns into an interminably messy three-hour affair simply centering on the standard theme of revenge.Maximus is sent to die in the woods but manages to get the upper hand and kill Commodus' henchmen. He returns to his homestead only to find his wife and son lynched from trees. Poor Maximus is denied the throne of Rome and is now being fueled to wage a one-man war against the sissy who wiped away his entire family. As Maximus works his way back to Rome, unbeknownst to the new king Commodus, our foppish king swishes around the kingdom ridiculously hitting on his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielson) and hovering inappropriately over his nephew Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark).In the first hour Ridley Scott has expertly painted his archetypal figures, forcing us to love the brave Maximus, wifeless and sonless, and hate the creepy teenager with the thirst for forbidden fruit. Maximus, once back in Rome, manages to enter a gladiator troop manned by one Proximo, the late Oliver Reed. This little group of circus freaks will provide Maximus with the proper cover through which he can maneuver himself into the hearts of Rome's people. Not only is the man driven by revenge but he is also cocky enough to believe that he has what it takes to accomplish the sort of feats no other gladiator has been able to accomplish. By his side is Juba (Djimon Hounsou), the proverbial Black voice of wisdom. If not for Will Smith's more unfortunately stereotypical role in Legend of Bagger Vance, this would have been the kind of role that would have garnered the deserved scorn of people like Spike Lee.For two hours, Scott inundates us with endless arena fireworks that would serve the acrobatics of the Rock and Hulk Hogan to a much better effect. The characterization of Crowe's character amounts to nothing more than a cocksure man, full of false bravado, whose only apparent skill is to raise his arm into the air and scream for his men to surge into battle. He is the kind of screen character who wages war against hundreds of foes within the course of a movie and manages to dispose of all of them with relative ease. He is also the kind of superhero archetype that garners the admiration of young boys like Lucius, something which causes our dear Commodus to go even further over the edge.Scott is to be admired in the end for at least not being a hypocrite, as he practices what he preaches. Since the citizens of Rome seem only to live for bloodlust, Scott manages to paint Gladiator as nothing else than that: entertainment geared for audiences whose sole interest is seeing men and tigers beat the s**t out of each other for three hours. But if this is all there was to the film then one would see little complaints from my person but Scott makes the mistake of filling his film with arty flourishes.The film opens with Maximus walking across a field, his hands slowly caressing tall blades of grass. These flashbacks, along with various cutaways to fast-moving skyscapes, amount to nothing more than pretentious attempts to add artistic credibility to an otherwise sophomoric film. Its as if he is aware of the fact that his film is devoid of any three-dimensional resonance that he tries to quickly interject soft touches of humanity into the proceedings. The end result is nothing less than visual illiteracy, ringing completely false and cowardly.When it comes to epics none come better than Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev or Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, two masterworks from Russia's greatest directors that fully captured the three-dimensional scope of war. The bad guys in these films, unlike the one played by Phoenix in Gladiator, are the kinds of foes whose selfishly malicious journeys are never cartoonishly drawn. The landscapes created by the Russian masters were poetic and grand, full of visual and emotional urgency. Scott's film is amounts to nothing more than being beat over the head by a club for three hours."
tt1345836,"Christopher Nolan's stunning conclusion to his Batman trilogy is a welcome return to form after the slightly overrated THE DARK KNIGHT, which was so obsessed with being all dark and brooding that it forgot to tell much of a story. Despite the presence of a much-hyped (and lamented) Heath Ledger in the cast, I found that film to be less entertaining than BATMAN BEGINS although it still remains an engaging and watchable film. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (horrible title, by the way), though, blows it out of the water, offering a piece of sheer spectacle that's as involving and as tightly-plotted as you could wish for.It's eight years since the last film, and Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is nowadays retired and definitely feeling his age. Before long, though, a hulking brute of a bad guy (Tom Hardy, whose sheer physicality in the role will surprise nobody who's seen Bronson) decides to do some very unpleasant things in the city, so it's time to dust off the bat suit and get back into the action. Good news for the viewer.As usual, Nolan surpasses the conventions of his genre, making this a superhero film that looks nothing like a superhero film, instead more like a modern-day epic of dramatic cinema. Yes, at the end of the day it's still about suited guys beating the hell out of each other, and Nolan once again relies on old conventions/clich√©s (such as the 'ticking bomb' trope, which he's repeated in his last three films now) to see him through, but everyone runs so well and so smoothly that you end up not minding.The cast is thorough and involved as ever, Bale as usual going the extra mile to portray the tortured hero and Caine lending emotional support as Alfred. Hardy's villain is a sheer powerhouse who dominates every scene he's in, and Nolan brings back a couple of his favourites from INCEPTION (Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) for good measure. There's not quite as much action as you might expect from a film of this type, but the storyline is so involved that you don't care. Throw plenty of stunning special effects into the mix and you have a real crowd-pleaser of a film with real brain as well as brawn."
tt0397103,"This is one of those movies that make you sit and wonder. Wonder about the difficulties that some underpreviliged people face. The hardships they go through while we just sit in the comfort of our homes enjoying whatever it is that we are doing. Very little do we actually do to help these people. In fact a vast majority of us, healthy people, aren't even aware of the sheer agony that these mentally or physically disabled people go through. We just live in our own world, lost in our luxuries, in our happiness while these people, who also happen to have flesh and blood like ours suffer, endlessly. Some do take notice, like Katie in the movie, who makes an effort despite having second thoughts and paying no heed to her boyfriends request to stay. She goes to a foreign country, to a different culture, taking us with her. She witnesses the plight of the young kids, almost all of them a lot younger than her and is swept away into a wave of emotion. Learning about a particular girl who's father had sacrificed a lot for her well being and failing to get her into surgery just because he was a little late, being hit by a bus in the process as well, Katie makes a bold move and in the middle of the night, leaves her hotel in search for the girl who lives in a different town. She shows a lot of courage and it is moving to see how a teenager feels so strongly for someone who she isn't related to, or even knows much about for that matter. Katie eventually meets the girl, Lin, who has a disfigured face and convinces her to visit the hospital for surgery. The movie teaches the viewer a number of things. It tells the viewer how easily an underpreviliged person's life can be drastically transformed into a beautiful one just with our little efforts. It's truly a great movie"
tt0848228,"I went into this movie with high expectations. I avoided reviews and went in unspoiled. I am a fan of the Iron Man movies, but I didn't see the newest Hulk movie, Thor or Captain America. This movie seemed to be lacking in character development and back story that make movies like the first Iron Man, X-men and The Dark Knight exceptional. It felt like I should have done my homework before seeing this one. This movie had a lot of action, but I never felt connected to the characters I hadn't seen before - Captain America, Thor, the Scarlett Johanssen character and the Jeremy Renner character. The Hulk was very inconsistent as well. In some parts of the movie he was uncontrollable, and in other parts he was a team player. And how did Hawk Eye take so long run out of arrows??? My idea of a ""great"" movie is that you get to know the characters through the movie itself. I shouldn't be expected to watch four or five other movies to get it. I enjoyed it, just not as much as I would have expected. Both my wife and I needed to get to the credits see get the character names of Black Widow and Hawk Eye. I'll go back and watch those other movies and maybe I'll appreciate it more."
tt0641650,"I am working my way through Mannix episodes on Amazon Prime and this is the absolute worst episode I ever saw. What makes it so bad? Spoilers Ahead: 1: The way bad girl Cindy ( Diane Keaton) was exposed as a killer. It was done exactly the same way Dana Elcar was exposed on a previous episode ( with bulletproof glass). One of the great things about Mannix is clever endings and not being able to figure out how Joe wins, and here you could see it coming a mile away. 2: There is the matter of Diane Keaton. She is an actress who ( except Baby Boom) never stood out to me good or bad ( not even in The Godfather). Here she was aggravating. Every single scene she popped in was cringe worthy ( especially her voice). Again the worst episode I have seen and I have seen over half of them. 1/10 stars."

The Wolf of Wall Street is one of my all time favourites.The remarkable story of Jordan Belfort, is love to know how much of this is actually true. There are multiple shocking scenes, my jaw dropped multiple times, one thing is clear, money talks.It's shocking, but it's also hilarious, there are so many funny moments, that scene with the dog at the end of the bed, too funny.Production values are off the charts, this film truly looks tremendous, it feels as though no one frame is wasted, no opportunity is missed to show off the wealth, the orgy of sex, drugs and money.Another stellar performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, he is outstanding as Belfort, one of his very best, not only does he look the part, but he exudes the character's greed's and desires.Robbie and Hill are first rate. It gets an extra point for featuring Joanna Lumley, albeit in a small role.A fascinating story.10/10."
tt1130884,"I hate to say this as much anyone else but for me this film had a horribly disappoint ending. First before I delve into that I'd like to say that the acting, the writing, the shooting, the film in general as far as quality goes was very good. But the ending was very disappointing. And no I am no idiot or newbie when it comes to film. But I thought the was very much a cop out. Now granted I know this is based off of a novel, hence there are certain restraints to adhering to this novel somewhat. That being said I found the idea of the medical experimentation, mental hospital, nazi experiments, and astray patients much more tantalizing, realistic, and more full of potential. The trick ending where its all in someone's head is done far too often sadly. I was hoping that while it dragged one there at the end it would ultimately reveal he was playing them or that he would stay true and not give in. But that didn't happen. I guess for me I was just expecting something not so clich√© for an ending from the likes of Scorsese's genius mind. But all things said and done I definitely can't give this movie all negative remarks, wonderfully acted and scripted. Great atmosphere, shooting, photography, etc. But I feel the ending should have been less clich√© or not as cheap I guess. Felt like it was just an easy way out and not fully developing the tension and intrigue that they had built throughout. But either way its each to their own, so maybe you will appreciate the ending more than I. FYI - I do understand the undertones of the ending and the ambiguity, but I don't think that saves the ending or does the film justice in it's entirety."
tt0102926,"Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) an FBI cadet is hired to try to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). He's a cannibal and VERY dangerous. Also there's a psychopath named Buffalo Bill kidnapping girls and skinning them alive. Lecter hints that he knows who Bill is and Clarice tries to find out...but Lecter is playing serious mind games with her.I caught this back in 1991. I liked it but I thought Foster was just OK and I found the story pretty confusing with glaring lapses in logic. Seeing it now some 17 years later I still feel the same way. The film is somewhat slow and I wasn't that scared or upset by it. Also Foster (who's Southern accent comes and goes at an alarming rate) is just OK. I'm really surprised that she won the Oscar for this. PLOT SPOILER AHEAD!!!! There was also a lot of gay groups who complained that Buffalo Bill was a transsexual. As a gay guy I wasn't offended but other people were just horrified. END SPOILER!!!Still the movie isn't a total washout. Hopkins is just superb as Lecter. He's downright terrifying at times. He's only on screen about a total of 30 minutes but you always feel his presence. Also his breakout (while completely illogical) is one of the scariest sequences I've ever seen. The whole movie is well-directed especially during the final sequence. Also it's the first horror film since 1932 to win an acting Academy Award. Heck, it won quite a few! Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Hopkins), Best Actress (Foster), Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. So, it's a very good thriller worth catching...but Academy Award material? I think it was a little overpraised.For horror fans there's an extra kick of seeing Roger Corman in a small role!""...I'm having an old friend for dinner."""
tt0133093,"This has to be the most overrated movie in sci-fi history.  It is way too long and the acting is stiff, especially Keanu ""get me a new facial expression"" Reeves.  Who cares about the special effects when the story is incoherent and uninteresting?  I certanly don't.  It disturbs me that many people consider this not only a great movie, but a classic!!!!  Did these people see the same movie I did.  I saw a dumb action movie with delusions of grandeur.  I say watch Star Wars again and see what real storytelling is all about."
tt0468569,"I thought I was getting a clever comic book movie. Instead, I got a profound, chilling introspection on good vs evil with allegorical references to God vs Satan, good vs evil, and social-political and true life realities that made me cry as the credits rolled at just the powerful, brilliant fil experience it was.I was enthralled and mesmerized with what the director and writers were doing to something that was only supposed to be a Batman movie. I've now seen it at least 10 times, and I still get the same feeling. This is big budget, blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best for the ages, a top 10 movie of all-time."
tt1345836,"Christopher Nolan has outdone himself with this one. At 3.30 in the morning, I was tired. Just getting out of it, I've never been so awake.Perhaps what set this film apart from his other films was that it had a genuine emotional heartbeat. I felt that this was a flaw of Nolan's other films - the vision of emotion was there, but it was hollow. In this I bought it. I felt it, hero and villain alike.Christian Bale was typically brilliant as Batman, and I felt that Bruce Wayne was more heavily embraced in this final installment. Bale added emotional depth to the character - a plot point that I think went astray in The Dark Knight - picking up from the development made in Batman Begins.Tom Hardy as Bane was quite simply, terrifying. No longer a dunderhead ""enforcer"", but one of the criminal masterminds behind ""Gotham's Reckoning"", coupled with a physical dominance strong enough to send shivers down your spine.Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle defied my expectations. Hands up who was not entirely convinced that that girl from the Princess Diaries could handle an intensely physical role like Catwoman. But here I am, hugely impressed. She added immeasurably to the value of the film.Marion Cotillard fulfilled the role of Miranda Tate admirably, though I suspect this was the most underdeveloped character of the film - though after watching, I can see why.The unsung hero of The Dark Knight Rises is Michael Caine as Alfred. A heartfelt performance that helps drive the emotional content of the film, helping Nolan sell his most well-rounded film to date. Caine's performance in both presence and absence.Special mention goes to Joseph Gordon Levitt, who is consistently proving himself to be a big player in the Hollywood game. His role as officer Blake felt like there could've been more, but it may just have come all a bit much. It was a great performance, and Levitt sunk his teeth into role.If you can, go see this in IMAX. If any film was to sell the format to skeptics, The Dark Knight Rises would be IT. I'm happy Nolan stuck to his guns and shot in 2D. 3D would have been unnecessary.I suppose at this point, I have to turn my focus on Nolan. If he ever reads this... aspiring filmmaker to filmmaker, I've never been so envious, jealous in all my life. It's a film that leaves me floundering, wondering what I could possibly do to get anywhere near this ballpark. Well done. I think an Oscar Nomination is in order.From here, I'm not sure what to expect of the future. Does our imagination carry us forward, or do the studios? Time will tell.10/10"
tt0102926,"Not an easy film to watch, but gripping all the same. Anthony Hopkins delivers one of the most complex and disturbed characters in the history of cinema, while a young Jodie Foster shines as the ambitious and smart Clarice Starling, on the trail of a deranged psychopath known as Buffalo Bill. But in order to find this man, she is going to need Hannibal Lecter's help...The horrifically disturbing manner of Buffalo Bill is powerfully delivered by Ted Levine, and in no doubt set the standard for how other thrillers are measured.The dreadful consequences of being a victim of a deranged psychopath is displayed to graphic effect in this now legendary award-winning film as we witness the horror and evil of this person's mind which in no doubt will send shivers down the spine.I've awarded The Silence of the Lambs eight points, which may mean nine to everyone else!"
tt0120737,"SOME SPOILERS AS WELLBefore I delve into my opinion, here's a little background... I've never read any of Tolkien's books. Heck, when I first saw the preview for LOTR in the theatre, I remember thinking, ""Well, that movie's gonna bomb, what the hell is that about?!"" I didn't even know the book existed. And no, I'm not a moron. I'm a 22-year old college graduate who read all the mandatory books in advanced English in high school and so on. I didn't see the first 2 movies in the theatre, and over the past 2 years, have picked up on the story on Tolkien's vision and the scope of the films and knew I owed them and myself to try them as a movie buff.That being said, I can not and will not compare them to the book(s) (Is it just 1 big book split into a trilogy, or 3 separate books?). I can only critique the 1st LOTR as a stand-alone movie.I got to say, after watching the movie, seeing the extra documentaries on the accompanying DVD, reading many reviews and seeing what some of the hard core experts have to say on here, I can't see why this movie is rated The #4 Movie Of All-Time on this great website.The scope of the film is phenomenal. I love the fact they filmed all 3 right in a row. The detail of the costumes, the sets, the actors -- the word amazing doens't do it enough justice.But I don't know anything about these books, or other books Tolkien wrote so people know backgrounds and histories of people. I'm talking about watching The Fellowship of the Ring as a stand alone work of art, as it should be. Therefore, I believe it is a flawed movie, simple as that.Consider me a case study becasue I knew NOTHING heading into the movie about the trilogy or the past stories of the characters. So, saying that again, I'll tell you what I got out of this movie.1. Awe-inspiring detail/imagery/cinemetography. It would make George Lucas soil his shorts. No doubt he's working hard right now trying to raise the bar for his Star Wars Episode 3.2. Flimsy characters. Again, before the die-hards flip out on me. I can only go with what's shown on the screen. And in 3 hours of what is basically an extended ""chase-movie"", I can sum up the main characters in quick phrases. Frodo; troubled Hobbit who bears a great burden. 2 other ""token"" Hobbits to add comedic breaks in the film. Viggo Mortenson's character had some depth because you could tell he was flawed (being a human) but his power/bravery/values etc showed. Then the other human = a caricature of how humans can go wrong (power-hungry). The Dwarf who's a stubborn fighter.3. How can the writers expect anyone to feel any pull towards the ""romantic"" part of the movie (the 2 minutes with Liv Tyler and Viggo) when we see no back story, no nothing? They hold hands a minute and she says she wants to marry him and not live eternally, that's what we got to go on? I felt nothing there.4. Gandolf was played awesomely. He deserved that Best Actor nod.5. I'm not saying the movie is cliche'd. I know that it's a ""trilogy"" so I'm not complaining about the ""lack"" of an ending. But somethings are just too much. The movie is like an extended get-away. I was left thinking at the introduction of every setting, What are they going to dodge next? And Gandolf is hanging by a thread on the stone bridge... Earlier in the film we see him throwing a fellow Wizard scross the room... dude, just float up! Am I wrong? These people of Middle Earth have access to fireworks that would make any 4th of July celebration on your block look ridiculous, and the best weapons they can come up with are axes, swords and bow and arrows?The people of Mordor have access to some kind of power which allowed the Original Bad Dude (sorry, I forgot his name) to create this all powerful ""Ring to rule all others"", am I right? What do they do? They make these Super-Orcs. Viggo was taking them down 3 at a time, and he's supposed to be the fallable human?!6. The ""bad guys"" on the black horses can sense instantly when Frodo puts on the ring.. So in the 50 years Biffo or the 111-year-old Hobbit had it, he NEVER put it on? If they were so hell bent on getting it back, what took them so long once it was taken from Gollum?Somebody else mentioned that they felt like a spectator of the events on screen, kind of disconnected, and I really agree. That may be because I never read the books, but it shouldn't be that way. The film should be able to stand on its own.I know this post may bother some of the hardcore fans who grew up with the book and love the films. But it's how I feel and I think it's obvious. I may be missing the boat here. I know of people who just don't get Star Wars and I really enjoy those movies. Don't get me wrong, this is more than a movie - it's an achievement of film. I have the utmost respect for Tolkien's vision (as a child, I drew up maps and things, dreaming of unknown worlds, but this guy is amazing... inventing 14 languages?!) and the actors and P.Jackson's dedication.But I just don't believe that this movie can contend for the title as one of the best movies of all-time, I'm sorry."
tt1853728,"Django Unchainted is probably one of the greatest modern westerns and one of the best films of 2012.The film has a lot of things to enjoy.It has an interesting,original plot that will make you feel like it is a spaghetti western made in the 60s but also has the right amount of modern touches like having some humour(besides that the film is mostly a drama) and that it shows the racism that existed at the time and how white people treated black people at the time.The film has great action sequences(especially some shootouts that were amazing) and has some gore and violence.It has incredible dialogue and amazing performances by Samuel L Jackson,Jamie Foxx,Leonardo Di Caprio and Christoph Waltz.The characters in the film were interesting and developed.Django's character was the most developed in the film.His actions and emotions were justified by his tragic past and he was lovable and the film made you care for him.The antagonist Calvin Candie played by Leonardo Di Caprio was interesting,intelligent and menacing and Christoph Waltz's character Dr Shultz was also very intelligent,likable and entertaining. It goes without saying that Quentin Tarantino's directing in the film was masterful.If you haven't see this you really should but I am sure that you already have seen it a thousand times."

Amazing story!
Amazing cinematography!
The cast and action is top notch!
Excellent."
tt0137523,"(Preface: I really think I was careful enough with my words to avoid any spoiling, but if vague descriptions count as spoilers to you, don't read on.)Let's face it - it's all about fighting - gruesome, stupid, uncivilized, uncultured, immature fighting. If you are a caveman, go ahead and like this movie. If not, then I am sincerely grateful for your existence in our world.On a side note, despite the plot holes, I figured out who Pitt's character was since the end-of-the-apartment scene. I'd be interested to know if anyone else was able to predict the same thing.The very end of the movie falls under the same category as the body - immature, shallow, and useless. I just gotta say it - this is my least favorite movie of all time."
tt0114369,"Back in the 90's, I spent a good deal of time frequenting my local video stores, so I was baffled that I had not seen Se7en. A 90's masterpiece that I somehow let slip through the cracks. How could I have missed out on this gem? That's simple, because it sucked. I probably did see it and just plain forgot. It's the typical cop mismatched partner movie who chase after a serial killer. Completely illogical script. Dumb ending with even dumber twist. Freeman, Pitt, Spacey and the rest did their jobs. Regardless, just a stupid story"
tt1853728,"Sadly, what could possibly have been a good story isn't because it relies on the tired Hollywood shoot-em-up formula. Society is changing it's view on killing, shooting and guns, yet movie makers still seem to think this is what the public wants to see. It is disappointing that a film which could have been groundbreaking won't have as much significance because of it's juvenile overvalued violence aspect. There are an abundance of truthful potential stories that could convey the same ""look how far we have all come from being a barbaric country that once had slaves"" feeling movie makers seem to want to credit themselves with (I'm thinking of that laughably unbelievable fictional story ""The Help"" which was also made into a film). To be worthwhile a filmmaker attempting to create something of value to present and future generations should look to a well researched, fascinating book like The Hemingses of Monticello: An American family by Annette Gordon-Reed for example. There are better ways to entertain oneself than watch this movie which all too quickly turns into a series of unnecessary bloodbaths."
tt0139414,"When you find yourself watching a film that is as atrocious as Lake Placid and you see that it was directed by a guy (Steve Miner) who has been involved in a number of competent movies and TV shows in the past, and it was written by a guy (David E. Kelley) who has created and written countless famous and popular TV shows, then you start to wonder if you're missing something. Is it actually possible that these men have somehow made a movie that is on the level of The Room in how horribly it is made? Were they perhaps intending to make a spoof, and failed to tell anyone? I'd like to think there was some intention behind the missteps in Lake Placid, but they seem to take the violence and drama so seriously that I struggle to believe it.There is so much insanity in this film that I was worried I was experiencing a stroke, because I couldn't make logical sense out of it. There are even times when it seems the actors are reading stage direction from the script, and yet no one bothered to cut it out. The attempts at jokes are ill-timed and never good for a laugh. In fact, the best humor in this movie comes when I don't think they intended it. Hearing nonsense dialogue like ""You are a mental."" is more entertaining than some attempt at witty banter. Lake Placid is one of the rare movies that is so inept that I actually started laughing. Typically I'm not the type who enjoys a so-bad-it's-good experience, but this one is oddly entertaining because it is so misguided.There are some talented actors in Lake Placid, but they all seem a bit confused on how they are supposed to act at any given moment. Bill Pullman seems bored through most of the movie, Bridget Fonda is an annoying damsel in distress most of the time, and Brendan Gleeson is desperately trying to hide that Irish accent with every word he says. There's a slim chance that Oliver Platt understood the ridiculousness of the movie he was in, but his character is still obnoxious. The odd part is that most of these characters have no good reason for being there in the first place. Somehow they all just congregate around this lake and become part of a crocodile hunt, despite the fact that they have no solid reason for risking their lives in this fashion.The logic of what happens in Lake Placid, and how the characters behave is less believable than the crappy CGI and animatronics of the crocodile. Another odd aspect of this film is that, typically in movies of this type you create an imminent danger that will put lots of people at risk. Yet in this case, we have a monster that won't affect anyone as long as they stay out of this small lake. Betty White even tells us that she's the only one living there, and that the croc has been around for more than a decade without any major incidents, so it's a low-risk situation. Yet they somehow must deal with the crocodile immediately. Everything about Lake Placid is a mess, but it is kind of a fun mess. No one should watch it in hopes of a good horror-thriller, but as an act of incompetence, it's a riot."
tt0313792,"I am a big fan of Woody Allen, and I must say this movie is not one of his best, but nevertheless, I loved it anyway. Even though Woody uses his old material in this movie, like when he gets paranoid about people talking about him being a Jew, it never gets old. His script was genius, like always. I also love the way he always depicts real life in his movies so accurately. I got turned on to Christina Ricci in this movie, she plays the part so well. The one thing I really did not like in the movie is how the conversations between Woody and Jason Biggs kept going on and on. I think it was because Woody used too many jokes one after another, it got old. Nevertheless, they were hilarious and very original. .. all i can say is.. woody Allen did it again!! i love him."
tt0102926,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" delivers an enthralling psychological thriller, distinguished by stellar performances and an intense interplay between characters. The dialogue is sharp and engaging, crafting a captivating dynamic, especially between the lead protagonists. However, the film's conclusion feels overly conventional and politically correct, somewhat at odds with the otherwise dark and unnerving atmosphere. Additionally, the plot occasionally treads into common, predictable territory, slightly diminishing its overall impact. Despite these elements, the movie remains a notable example of suspenseful storytelling in cinema."
tt1130884,"This film is unadulterated rubbish (1)The plot is soo predictable - we know Di Caprio's a mental patient from about 10 minutes in (2 & 3).This can be the missing bit - like the film's lack of credibility (4)Would the staff of the mental institution bother to indulge his fantasies to this extent as a means of effecting a cure - probably not (5 & 6)This film sends itself up by taking itself too seriously (7)The supporting characters deliberately make themselves look sinister, the director tries to make the film play out like a modern remake of a Hitchcock movie - it fails to impress on any all level (8-10) there done it!"
tt0914805,"Okay, first off, this film is not everybody's cup of tea. But if it is yours, and you can handle the graphic violence and frightening look at the human psyche at its most damaged, then you'll be amazed.It was disturbing as hell. It made me sick to my stomach (and I wasn't going into this blind--I'd been warned it was graphic). These people act so normal about what they're doing and that just threw me. This film has a very unique and little-before-seen take on serial killers and this fresh new approach is what makes it so frighteningly powerful.The lady wants to put pictures up in the basement where they torture people. Wow, she's a regular freak, though, isn't she? Little details like that throughout the film remind the audience that something is so very wrong in these two character's heads. (And actually, I nearly typed 'people' instead of 'characters' because they are way too real. The documentary style gives it that extra-real feel as well.) I was grimacing through the whole thing.The husband and wife bicker, like a real couple. He throws out ideas on how to approach their murders and she's eager to see and learn. Between their murdering sprees they have ""loving"" moments with their two children. ""You need to clean up that mess""... These characters probably seem normal outside the house but they're so subtly ""off."" They're the type of people who would, if you were to pass them in the grocery store or on the street without knowing who they are, give a gut feeling that says ""STAY AWAY--don't know why just STAY AWAY."" And the grotesque sound effects and the wife's Christmas present.... You'll need to see it to believe. Normal words fail me here.Now--on to the aesthetic parts of the film (and yes, believe it or not, there ARE some): The lighting and color is gorgeous (is that the right word for a film like this?). The entire film has a desaturated, slightly off-color look which helps bring you into this off-kilter world of the home-video-making serial killer. It's easy on the eyes but it's the only thing that is.The entire movie was shot home-video style, which lends for a slight camera shake throughout. It works well, making everything feel much more real, but also causes the film at times to move a bit slowly.The music in the background at the beginning is reminiscent of...really old cartoons. Like the kind where one of the characters is mischievous by nature. It evokes a really interesting feeling from the get-go, sort of like everything is off-kilter. And it's very subtle. The music never proclaims the characters are doing something dramatic or evil.The actors are phenomenal. They totally made me believe it. And the way the film opens--over black, with narration...it sets the mood for the dark that will follow.In closing, this film felt way too real and that made it very uncomfortable (well...that word's too tame in this case...). But wow. Just wow. Disturbing on a level I can't even contemplate because these characters were just. so. WRONG. And this is an amazingly scary movie, not because of the blood and gore, but because of the way this film captured the darkest and frankly most disgusting parts of humanity. It's sickening because it's real--because there are people like that. Heck, I'm pretty sure I've passed one or two in the supermarket--we probably all have.So, this film is AMAZING in its own right--again, if it's your cup of tea. If not, avoid it like the plague; but if you're ready for a dip into the dark and everything we fear but never talk about, then watch this film. You won't be disappointed."
tt0468569,"This movie is too long by about 30 minutes. I was happy when the screen finally went dark. A filmmaker should be able to get his point across in under 2 hours or before the collective audience ass starts hurting.It's a comic book and the effects and makeup are really great, but still, some of it is too inexplicable and so beyond the possible that it undermines the characters. The Joker is deliciously strange and evil but if he can arrange those events that are so very complex, he starts to look more like a circus ringleader whose dancing dogs and fireworks are the real characters.The story was very hard for me to follow. I don't appreciate having to try so hard to figure out what and why things happen in a movie. I am still not sure why Mr. ""Two Face"" went sour and frankly I didn't care that he did.There is a very heavy thematic effort here; much of film is trying to clearly define good vs. evil and the shifting ambiguity of that, to end with Batman becoming rather dark and isolated. I applaud this kind of effort in an action film, but here the authors take just too long to get there. I was itching to get out of my seat and had to force myself to sit through to the very end, and that's not good for any movie."
tt0108052,"Poor acting, poor direction.  Every theme cannot be made into a movie. This tragedy in our time could not.  The horror of it all is just to great to be made into something the entertain, a popcorn smacking, no-nothing about history, clue-less to suffering, average audience.  Would have been better to have left it alone."
tt7286456,"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director"
tt1375666,"Watch out - the amount of intelligent scriptwriting you accredit this funny movie with may be surprisingly linear to the lack of simple scientific knowledge and common sense you might possess!I simply CAN NOT believe that this movie has a 9.1 rating on IMDb. It makes me question a) the people or b) people who take time to write reviews. This is actually my first comment here and its catalyzed by the imposing will to set one thing straight: It is an absolutely average Hollywood flick and the first that made me question Leo's decision. I became a fan of this excellent acting in the recent years but it was actually painful to listen to the randomly pulled together pseudo-scientific plot. If you know anything about what they try to make up you will start laughing or continue to watch and hope for the good stuff to start. The action was good and the movie definitely has it's moments but I couldn't ""enjoy"" it until the last hour.Watch it if you can be easily pursued into a poorly presented idea, believe it and be drawn into it. And there seems to be nothing else worth watching right now - unless you check some aspiring independent movies.Don't watch it if you like sci-fi that is believable and passionate. This one is one lame attempt -or just a blown up money grab. As overrated as Batman."
tt0468569,"Not a great Batman film fan because of the past films turning it into a dark farce, but I thought I would give this more serious one a go. At the start I quite enjoyed it. I like Bale and I liked the serious way of filming it where gravity did exist and the characters weren't capable of doing really stupid things, like Spiderman.But it wasn't long before the story got a bit daft. A lot was happening that just started to ignore common sense. The story line just started to go anywhere as long as it got to the next part of the story. You constantly find yourself watching thinking ""but that wouldn't happen"".... Yeah its Batman, but when the story gets silly just to meet the outcome...well I kinda gave up on it.The story was very...well...confusing. It kept jumping around trying to be all twisty and clever but it just made me feel aggravated. The scene jumping got madder and madder as time went on...and on...and on....I soon found myself busting for the toilet, which got me wondering how long have I been watching this film for? This film is so bloated it is ridiculous. I kept thinking this next build up was the end...but then it just carried on. There are so many false horizons in this film it is unbelievable. This was one of those VERY rare times when I just wanted the film to end...I was begging it to end.Hard to sum this one up, as all I wanted for it to do...was end. I stopped paying attention to the countless stupid attempts at a story twist...I just didn't care. From what I remember it was a shallow storyline that I just didn't buy into.Now for my real moan...the high rating this film has on IMDb....evidence of more ratings corruption on this website. You used to be able to trust these film ratings but it appears that the marketing departments know exactly how to exaggerate these figures...which I find very annoying. IMDb...do something about this or risk losing your loyal visitors to this once highly regarded website.Would I recommend this film....NO...too long and not worth the sore bum."
tt1375666,"Nolan is careful never to let the scope of the film overwhelm the human element and this is a key reason Inception works as well as it does. The acting, from a great ensemble led by DiCaprio, is as good as it gets. In terms of sheer originality, ambition and achievement, Inception is the movie of the summer, the movie of the year and the movie of our dreams. world need directors like Nolan,Spielberg,Cameron, As with his previous movies, Nolan displays a knack for choosing actors who can best embody the characters in his films. While DiCaprio's role here may be reminiscent of that in his earlier Shutter Island, there's no question that he anchors the movie with a perfectly calibrated performance that is equal parts intense and heartfelt. The rest of the supporting characters fill out their roles just as vividly- Joseph Gordon-Levitt radiates confidence and suavity, Ellen Page displays suitable wit and grit, and in particular Marion Cotillard exudes both sultriness and danger in an edgy yet eventually heartbreaking performance.But ""Inception"" is Nolan's vision through and through- and in fact, a visionary director and a master filmmaker at that. Many years Nolan spent refining his screenplay, and it shows in the great detail and complexity that makes ""Inception"" both an intellectual and visceral enjoyment- just take the names of the various characters, each of which have a special significance. With ""Inception"", Nolan invites you to open your mind to possibilities- possibilities of alternate realities, of complexities beyond the conscious mind to grasp and most importantly, of the power of imagination. It is that rare gem of a film that is so multi-layered, so profound and so fascinating that you'll want to experience it again immediately after you've seen it- just so you can fully appreciate its genius."
tt0108052,"I'm going to have to agree with a previous comment that 'people only liked this because it was seen as unwise' to objectively comment. This was a 'cause movie'- and as such is no better, or no worse, than the others. Like 'Amistad' that followed it, it's plodding, pretentious and badly shot. The black and white cinematography lends nothing to it except the illusion of reality; which it isn't: it's a film. It's a story. Not a documentary. It's a constructed series of events, with 'characters' and a 'narrative' and a 'script'. The fact that the holocaust-survivors laud it as 'how it was' is the ultimate expression of its failure. The novel left you thankful that you weren't there, but never once made you feel like you were. Spielberg's film tricks you into imagining that it shows how terrible the holocaust was- it doesn't. And can't.Many have stated that they 'understand' the events of Hitler's Germany through the movie. By giving them this false 'understanding'; Spielberg has cheapened it, and made it more comfortable than it should be. Subjectively, for many, this grants them leave to display false, *constructed*, grief for something that no amount of 'grieving' can in any way come to terms with.As a film; a piece of fictionalised narrative, it suffers from hammy performances... most obviously the ridiculous Ralph Fiennes with his sitcom nazi- a safe, comfortable idea; neatly slotting him into the 'bad guys' package that drama utilises, but 'real life' finds no easy place for.A film shot in black and white that regrettably uses these absolutes in its storytelling. An effective parable? Perhaps. But a worrying one.Steev"
tt0422272,"The acting was phenomenal from the little girl, the mechanical girl honeslty could have been more realistic, had some pretty good scares, storyline made me cry, ending was very well written, loved that the workers took the girls scares into consideration and not acted dumb. This is the first film I've seen in a while that has amazing visuals and characters that are very well written into the script. We had backstory and backgrounds that made sense and made the storyline even more emotional and compelling. This film had its twists and turns that brought on a little suspense and surprise in a great twist till the end."
tt0109830,"With this movie Hollywood tried to create something like an independent movie. In my opinion they failed. It's like adding lots of elements people like about independent movies and expecting something meaningful. If you liked this one you should really have a look on some serious movies.On the other hand it is a good thing they at least tried to create something more meaningful. They tried to create something you could really call art. Maybe they have been out of ideas, maybe they were experimenting and the financial success and it's board recognition are good signs. Just please don't create a movie if you don't really have anything to talk about."
tt0172495,"I heard this movie was visual masterpiece and ended up watching it. It was true, this film is visually very good, but the storyline and the screenplay isn't really satisfying.Watching this movie atleast for once is recommended."
tt0848228,"Without a doubt, THE AVENGERS is the most expensive video game ever produced; why the techs would want to try to integrate live-action elements, however, is beyond me: the cartoon was okay without them. Robert Downey has the best lines (half a dozen one-liners, to be precise), though Thor's contention that Loki ""was adopted"" was just as funny. Sam Jackson looks just plain bored throughout- which is saying a lot when one considers the fact that he's the most overrated actor in Hollywood. You know a movie's heavily padded when fully one-third of it could be cut and never missed: the first third of this game is mind-numbingly clich√©d and plays out like yet another pseudo-military video game (what used to be called ""first-person shooter"" games but are nowadays referred to as ""first-person action"" games) or television show the likes of which we've seen a thousand times. The skrull at the end was a nice little touch, but I wonder why comics- and now their celluloid incarnations- tend to focus on alien invasions for their ""big get-togethers"" when there are more than enough wannabe tyrants here on Earth...? I think John Carpenter (THEY LIVE) and George Romero (LAND OF THE DEAD) had it right: we have seen The Enemy, and He is Us. Give me RODNEY CECIL, PSYCHO HERO any day."
tt0848228,"I heard somewhere this was the first great Marvel flick, or this was the one to watch first, or something like that. Overall, it was entertaining but nothing special. The characters and story are pretty cliched. Some powerful object (a tesseract) falls into the hands of a malicious superhero (Loki, well played by Tom Hiddleston) and a crew comes together to try to get it back from him before he can pass it to the evil aliens who want to destroy Earth. They try to liven things up by creating some character and conflicts and the like, but for the most part it is a snooze. Downey's Iron Man is ironic and witty, Thor turns out to be the estranged brother of Loki, yeah yeah. These kinds of flicks are plug and play, get some star actors and plug them in, and so long as they look the part, things work out. It is fun to watch them flying around midtown Manhattan and smashing things up. The effects are the real stars.It is interesting to note that like our ancestors from previous centuries, the modern world wants to have its myths and its heroes - I guess old habits tend to stick around. But these myths mean very little and serve mostly to keep people's eyes glued to a screen."
tt0109830,"""Forrest Gump"" is a classic movie that everyone's seen a dozen times, and if you haven't you probably know all the quotes: You've heard ""Run, Forrest, run"" and ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" and so on, and you've heard impressions of Tom Hanks's slow Southern drawl in varying degrees of similitude and awfulness. The movie ambles charmingly along with its protagonist, following him from Alabama to Vietnam to a Louisiana shrimp boat, watching him meet presidents and celebrities, and regularly churning out life lessons. A charming, amiable sort of movie, if only those life lessons weren't so sickening.Forrest never does much of anything, but wonderful things just keep happening to him. His miraculous sprinting earns him a college football scholarship, and he meets John Kennedy after the championship game. He joins the army and goes off to the Vietnam War, where he wins the Medal of Honor. He becomes a wealthy shrimp-boat captain after surviving a hurricane, also rather miraculously. Everything just keeps getting better for him.Meanwhile, his single mother is stricken with cancer, and dies. His childhood friend Jenny, after struggling with drugs, gets AIDS and dies. His army friend Bubba is killed in Vietnam. His other friend, Lieutenant Dan, gets off easy by comparison, only losing his legs and spending much of the film in a wheelchair.The obvious and unequivocal message of all this is that it was good to be a straight white man in America in the second half of the twentieth century. The movie's two women both live hard lives and die young, as does Bubba, who is black. Lieutenant Dan is white, by the way.Forrest is oblivious to nearly everything. Good things are handed to him, like that box of chocolates or the Apple stock he just happened to come by. He even accidentally inspires the iconic yellow smiley face.Looking at it this way, it's less of a nostalgic trip down our collective memory lane and more of a scathing satire on the inequities of American society. Someone should tell the folks who keep posting this on their ""Best Conservative Movies"" lists."
tt0139414,"I loved this film. Bridget Fonda's best work. Her character was eminently vulnerable and both Bill Pullman and Brendan Gleeson were the perfect straight men for her comedy. Oliver Platt pitted against Brendan Gleeson was a fantastic mix. The writing is dead on and it is a very enjoyable show that you can watch more than once and realize that you've missed a joke.The special effects left something to be desired. It was very clear that they didn't have ""green screen"" technology at their disposal. However, the fake special effects are overridden by extremely strong performances by very talented character actors.I would have given the film a higher rating, despite the lack of good special effects, because the acting on the part of most of the character actors created an ensemble piece that became, by the end of the film amazing.Unfortunately Betty White's cussing scenes brought the movie down. It's the one misstep the writers and/or casting team took.However, this was an ensemble character driven movie with four VERY strong performances."
tt0108052,"To me, Spielberg's Schindler's List is one of the most incredible movies made to date for several reasons. This classic film is an emotionally charged historical drama; based on true story. It thugs at your heart, it tells the story of the good in all of us, as Oskar Schindler becomes the unlikely hero, saving the lives of over 1000 Jews during the Nazi madness. I have a VHS collector's copy of the film."
tt0110912,"No, this film did not repulse me as much as reservoir dogs did. That's among the best things I can say about this movie. The fact that so many people seem to love it so much is actually frightening to me. I just can't seem to understand the desire to see this director's shock value material. What is the fascination with seeing ears cut off or needles jammed into people? I sat through it and must admit there were some positive things worthy of note. I did laugh at some scenes and John Travolta's performance was his only good one since the 70s. My 3 pts out of 10 are for: 1)Samuel Jackson with the hamburger 2)the absolutely ridiculous story by Christopher Walken and 3) the absurdity of Keitel coming in to clean up the mess. All in all, excrutiating, but as I say a step up from the first film by Tarantino."
tt0372784,"Of course this film has it's good points, especially when it is compared to the other Batman films. It is darker, less aimed at children, funny input by Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine and !!!OF COURSE!!! the best Batman ever (Christian Bale).What about all the bad points? The whole 'Karate-kid' beginning, the lack of a good villain, the lack of originality, the cheesy hint at 'Batman Continues' (or whatever it will be named), the superficial character that is Mr. Gordon (a man of Gary Oldman's talent is wasted here), the bad editing (I just could not figure many of the fight scenes out...I like them kick-ass...Michael Keaton Style), the bad love interest (really...what's her name is awful). I could continue...but I won't. Sure this is just the beginning but keeping the above in mind, the scale can go BOTH ways. The beginning is OK, the character is SET, now (please) BLOW US AWAY (and don't try and do it by blowing more stuff up and creating idiotic stunts and villains).6,75 out of 10 (with a tiny seven given upon voting, although the film is highly overrated, being # 111 in the top 250)"
tt0372784,"Is this what passes for a slick comic book movie these days? A movie so attached to the concept of being dark, gloomy and melodramatic that it has forgotten somewhere along the way to entertain us? Movies like this are what happens when producers insist on pandering to fanboys. In an obvious attempt to give the 18-35 male demographic exactly what they pine for, this movie features a lot of mindless combat (hastily edited to avoid the need for any complex choreography), a marginal plot, a lot of wasted talent and a protagonist who literally scratches his own voice in a futile attempt to appear 'tough' inside a latex suit.The result is a cumbersome movie that looks and sounds a lot like a dark oily calliope. The batman suit in this one is laughably bad, the assistant DA looks and sounds more like a high school prom date and Michael Caine looks as bored as he did in Jaws III.A lot of rain, some interesting cinematography here and there and some stolen camera tricks from another horror film, make Batman Begins slightly more than awful, but in summary this movie isn't fun, it isn't that violent, it's very convoluted and really strains your attention span. The strain on your attention span would be more than forgivable if it was used to develop character, plot and mood, but instead it's mostly used to just wheeze itself along like a big, rusty tank.Batman is supposed to be dark, supposed to be violent and in many ways is supposed to represent the ultimate Nietzsche/Fascist fantasy. Batman is a character that owns everything and then physically beats up anyone who tries to steal anything from the very city he owns lock, stock and barrel. You can work with that premise to weave in all kinds of interesting themes, ideas and stories, best exemplified with such comic books as Arkham Asylum and Killing Joke.Here it just plays out like some giant, rainy offering to fanboys everywhere. It leaves the rest of us bored and pining for the days when action films weren't a dime a dozen and weren't this bloated and cumbersome.All I ask is a dumb movie like this provide a few laughs and thrills to go along with our bucket of popcorn. Instead I got something that took itself too seriously but then provided so little substance in return for its gravitas."
tt0109830,"The moment you see that the protagonist is Tom Hanks, you know this movie's gonna be great- and it is ! Everything works in this movie- The music, the acting, the story, the dialog, the romance, the drama, the humor.... Everything works flawlessly !! Hanks is absolutely magnificent, his character is fantastic !! After watching this film, I really think Tom Hanks could be the next DiCaprio !! He can act so dramatic at one minute, the other minute he can be so hilarious you won't believe how excellent he can act !! Also, every character works. I won't spoil anything but even if something happens to a curtain character and you don't cry, you'll still think the actor did a great job portraying the character. This film deserves 10/10, it's impossible to feel bored in this movie, every second you can either laugh hysterically, feel so invested in the story and the dialog, or even cry when something sad happens. This film is a must watch !!!"
tt0993846,"Let me start of with the basics, prior to watching this movie I heard the city of Dubai censored this movie down by ~40mins by cutting out rude scenes involving sex, nudity and so forth. At first I was rather flabbergasted at this opinion, however when I saw this movie last night, I realized they had every right to do so. Most of the scenes dragged on way beyond it's point where it started venturing near a soft porn clip.The movie will be much more enjoyable had it been a 2hr running time with 85% of the useless sexual references removed. If I wanted to see something as full-frontal I would have watched Eyes Wide Shut.To me it seemed the jump from the garage operated boiler-room to the full-blown office was slightly over expedited. We never got to see Jordan's ""lows"".Leo does a fabulous job with his performance however as the title suggests, I think the movie had better potential in many different ways.Final thought? If you're a Leo die-hard fan, watch it, otherwise be prepared for a soft-porno of drugs and sex."
tt0068646,I don't typically like gangster mob films. I tried this film because I thought it would be a good film to see as a student studying film. I didn't like it and I guess I should have known I wouldn't. Cheers to those who do.
tt0120737,"I seem to be almost alone in not liking this movie... I found it generally lacking the depth of the book - not surprising, as it would be quite impossible to condense the immense amount of material in the book to a movie, however long.However, I entered it fully expecting things to change. Unfortunately, I just found a rather poorly done movie.Some aspects were wonderful, yes. The visuals were spot-on, for the most part. The effects were stunning (with a few exceptions...). But the script... oh, the script!My biggest problem was the general simplification of things. The incredible mystery of the book, the sense that what starts out as a simple adventure is actually a vastly larger story is quite lacking. They simply gave away too much - the information in the voiceover at the beginning for example, was a complete waste of time: why give away all of that at the beginning? Why not show things from the hobbits point of view? ""A silly fellow went off on an adventure, and brought back treasure, among which was a ring!"" And then start revealing more and more of the story gradually - this could be easily done with explanations by Gandalf and Elrond, exactly as it was in the book.Likewise, other ""mysterious"" aspects were just dropped - showing Gandalf and Saruman's battle was a fine example. A much better way of doing this would be to simply have the hobbits arrive at the Prancing Pony and not find Gandalf! As it is, the audience knew exactly what was happening right at the start, ruining the suspense..In general, a vast story, full of intrigue and a great sense of things being larger than just the small part the characters play was reduced to a jolly adventure story. Even this adventure was poorly executed - the mood of the most poignant moments was ruined by falling back on cheesy cliches and feeble attempts at humour.. In Moria, for example, right before Gandalf's 'death', the terrible ""dwarf-tossing"" joke. Sure, it's silly.. but it makes a part of the story that could have been genuinely terrifying a complete spoof! Ruins the mood entirely.. Likewise, the pathetic battle scene antics: first of all, shake the camera violently whenever there's any action, and then use all the cliches you can: the bit where one of the hobbits looks to the left, sees the monster, then looks to the right and sees the monster. Then back to the left: no monster! And he relaxes. Then the monster jumps out from the right again!Oh eek.Finally, big parts of the story just didn't make much sense without the background present in the book: the trip to the mountains, for example, was a complete waste of time. It would have been better to just cut that, and leave more time to develop some of the other bits that were severely lacking - the entire time spent in lothlorien was quite useless as presented. ""Wicked elf witch""? If it's going to be simplified that much, (and I acknowledge that it's necessary in a movie adaptation, and expect it!) why not rearrange it in a way that at least makes sense? Half the actions in the movie seemed to be done simply because it was a way to have a jolly adventure, rather than because there was actually any reason to do it.Anyway... It was a let down. Luckily, I managed to avoid the hype, and didn't get my hopes up at all. But it was much worse than I expected. I'm amazed that I seem to be one of the few that thought this way..."
tt0137523,"The biggest rubbish of all time, this film is fascist, ridiculous, unbelievable, promotes hate and violence, talks about nothing worth being adapted on screen.Again, what is this movie about ? A bipolar man founding a hooligan gang that commits crime in the U.S. Wow, what a waste of time and this is what is wrong with people: people have no taste. The cinematography is terrible, the acting terrible, the characters dull and the dialogue laughable.This is all testosterone and gratuitous violence, scenes that have no relation, no linear coherence.It stinks, it's fascist, it's Sylvester Stallone bull material."
tt0110912,"Tarantino is one of the best directors of the world to himself. His Cinematographic was spectacular. Pulp Fiction was model for young filmmakers around the world with so many great scene.It's Brilliant.Tarantino borrowed amazing classic movie. combine them in best way then make his own masterpiece. soundtrack was great too. The Characterizations was awesome. It was nominated Oscar.Travolta dancing with Thurman was good.I really enjoyed to watch this movie. Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10."
tt0111353,"Following a trite formula laced with hackneyed dialogue is not to be recommended for a production intended to develop abiding interest in viewers, but this tiresome and weakly directed work does just that, with predictably lacklustre results. Terminally stricken by cancer, Ed Reece (Kirk Douglas) desires only to die in the bed wherein he was born, and the curmudgeonly old-timer is able to interest his estranged son Larry (Craig T. Nelson), notable chiefly for draft dodging and for abandonment of his wife and two children, in accompanying Ed to California, apparent location of the sought after bed, a pilgrimage contrary to the wishes of other members of the Reece family. As father and son wend their way westward, all the while barely maintaining a disquieted sense of filial comradeship, Ed's wife and other children, along with various in-laws, can only surmise at the route the pair is taking, at the same time vigorously squabbling among themselves. Director Tom McLoughlin vainly endeavours to establish a picaresque tone at the storyline center, but most of the film's sequences fall flat with mawkish dialogue to the fore, including an episode featuring a visit of Ed with an old flame, performed by Eileen Brennan. Reece clan members left behind call into service various law enforcement agencies in an attempt to halt the quixotic trek, while Ed tries to bring about a reconciliation between Larry and his forsaken spouse Connie (Bess Armstrong), as scenes of ostensible humorous intent are desperately non-comedic, one predictable event following closely upon another throughout this leaden affair. McLoughlin leads his cast in flaccid manner, viewer tedium increased by having supporting players standing listlessly about while principals exchange lines that are consistently pretentious and boring, although it must be stated that a weak script hampers any effort at organizational adroitness. Less agitation among the secondary Reece characters might have handily contributed to a less scrambled, inert plot line, one having a much-needed greater basis in those elements that foster narrative flow. As a member of the Reece tribe, Lee Garlington wins acting honours here despite a thinly written role. A Fremantle DVD release offers no extras but its visual as well as sound quality is each very high."
tt1853728,"I love Tarantino, but this one was so far over the top, you couldn't even see the top from where I was. Although there were a couple of good Tarantino-esque scenes of dialog, there wasn't enough to sink my teeth into. Jamie Foxx was solid. Christoph Waltz was excellent as usual. Leo D. had his moments. Samuel L. Jackson was terrific as the house slave, playing somewhat against type (although subservient, he was still irascible and no pushover, so that was in keeping with his usual persona.) The characters' actions were generally uninteresting and the action was predictable. The violence was over the top, even for QT. How many times can he show a bullet causing someone's head/chest/leg/arm to explode? It wasn't boring by any means, it just didn't live up to my hopes for it. QT is so in love with playing with the filmic conventions of his youth, he sometimes forgets to make a good film."
tt0167260,"There's just too much material in the LOTR books to fit into even three long films, and Peter Jackson has done some severe pruning here, losing the rather bloodthirsty ""Scouring of the Shire"" and the downfall of Saruman. In fact, about a third of this movies is taken up with stuff that should have been in ""The Two Towers"" but presumably didn't fit.The major problem is that (as in TTT) Jackson has inserted yet more of his own Aragorn-Arwen scenes to try and keep some romantic plot going, and presumably maintain the interest of female viewers dragged to the cinema by their boyfriends and husbands. It's a waste of screen time which should have been better used.Visually - as with the other films - it's almost impeccable (a few obviously painted backgrounds here and there such as the Grey Havens), and the acting is first class, although I do find Legolas' stunts increasingly ridiculous.One day someone might make the definitive LOTR films, but Jackson has ensured it won't be for a long time yet."
tt0068646,"I'm not a fan of this type of movies, but since I like Al Pacino and I've heard so much about this so-called ""legendary"" Godfather, I decided to give it a try. I must say this is the most inexplicably overrated piece of trash I've ever seen. The characters are all ridiculous, unsympathetic and under developed, the story drags and lacks any real conflict and dynamicsBut the most disgusting aspect is the movie's intent to glorify a bunch of low-life criminals and turn them into larger-than-life figures, into some kind of royalty. This whole ""family"" tradition is just ludicrous. We're supposed to ""care"" about these characters, to think that they are ""cool"". The major problem here is that there's no real conflict. There's no redeeming value whatsoever, they're all despicable and one-dimensional, so why the hell would I care.The violence (which is particularly sickening) is another issue, but I guess audiences have come to appreciate it, and it's now a ""hallmark"" of the genre. Imagine, the Godfather's pregnant daughter gets beaten with a belt. But guess what: she's not likable either! She's hysterical, obnoxious and, even worse, she keeps defending her abusive husband. In another scene, James Caan beats the hell out of someone in front of children. Marvelous! That's just great, not to mention cool and ""culturally relevant"".Marlon Brando speaking with a husky voice and cotton in his mouth is incredibly ridiculous. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone suddenly turns, from a principled man who doesn't want to have anything to do with murder, into a ruthless criminal. What? This character has no depth, no consistency whatsoever. His relationships with women are so poorly portrayed, they add nothing to his development. It's Pacino's worst, I can't imagine why anyone would think this is a great performance. If you want to see a good gangster movie, go watch ""Donnie Brasco"" instead."
tt0167261,"In my review of 'The Chamber of Secrets' I mentioned how tough the job of Chris Columbus, director of the Harry Potter movies was. However when it comes to adapting books to film his job looks straightforward compared to Peter Jackson's. Over a thousand pages of novel had to be trimmed and shaped into six hours of film, perhaps two dozen important characters to bring to life, millions of devoted Tolkien fans and also the general filmgoing public to satisfy. I thought he did an amazing job with 'The Fellowship of the Ring', which was, aside from a few overwrought moments, probably as good an adaption as could possibly have been made. Unfortunately I can not say the same for 'The Two Towers'.Oh, it is very good - Jackson again shows what a master he is at staging battle scenes and creating moments of wonder and horror, the special effects and New Zealand scenery are breathtaking and the quality cast again do a good job. But there are moments that are a bit corny and scenes that could have been more tense and exciting than they were.The story consists of three seperate plot lines - Merry and Pippin journey into Fangorn Forest where they meet the Ents, the ancient Shepherds of the Trees, Frodo and Sam head closer to Mordor with Gollum, the twisted former possessor of the One Ring, and the remaining members of the Fellowship fight to save the kingdom of Rohan from the forces of Saruman, who has used magic and a treacherous advisor to enfeeble Theoden, Rohan's king.While it is packed with characters and events, there is not as much in 'The Two Towers' as there was in 'Fellowship', so while it does not have quite the variety of locations events that the first film did, Jackson has been able to create a film that is not as episodic this time (which was inevitable with the theatrical version of 'Fellowship' - see the extended DVD version for a longer, better-paced cut). The three-pronged story is still which was the screenwriters and editors biggest problem, as they had to try and juggle and balance the plots so that the viewer follows what is going on while the movie's momentum is maintained. Generally I think Jackson and company did a fine job but, especially towards the end of the movie, they could have done a better one. The film cuts between the climaxes of all three plots which reduces the power of each of them, especially the epic battle of Helm's Deep. The battle is a huge, superbly choreographed sequence but the tension that it creates gets released too often as we shift to what Sam and Frodo or Merry and Pippin are doing. I think it would have been better to finish Sam and Frodo's story, except for the epilogue with Gollum, which belongs at the end, before cutting between the battle at Helm's Deep and the hobbits' dealings with the Ents.Partly to provide a climax, a lot has been changed from the book. Many things that were in 'The Two Towers' will now be in the third movie (which makes me wonder how they will fit everything into 'The Return of the King') and a few things have been added. Some of the additions, such as the battle with the warg-riders and the Black Rider's sweep over the Dead Marshes, are very good. Others, such as Aragorn's near-death experience and his triumphant return, the slow-motion fall of Haldir and the reunion of a mother with her children are cliched. The screenplay is a flawed one: it does not always explain what is going on adequately and there are a disappointing number of melodramatic moments. I could have done with less shots of frightened women and children, less inspirational speeches, less beams of shining light and, though he was funny, less of Gimli the dwarf as comic relief. Sometimes, as at Helm's Deep, the atmosphere should be grim and frightening and a joke spoils the mood. As do a few cute, anachronistic moments such as when Legolas skates down stairs on a shield or when Sam talks about what it would be like to be a character in a great story. 'The Lord of the Rings' is not supposed to be postmodern - such moments just take you out of the alternative world that the movie is trying to create by reminding you that it is a movie.But while it is not up to the very high standard of 'Fellowship', 'The Two Towers' is still a quality movie: spectacular, sometimes stirring and gorgious to look at and listen to. There is one other thing that would make it worth seeing: Gollum. The first CGI character to actually act well, Gollum, with his split personality, creepy voice and pale, veiny, superbly rendered body, is fascinating to watch. All his scenes are among the movie's best. If 'The Two Towers' does get an Oscar nomination for acting Andy Serkis, who did the voice and the movements that Gollum was based on, will probably be the one. I suspect though that this won't be the year that Peter Jackson gets to go up for Best Director or Best Film. Oh well, there's still 'The Return of the King.'7 1/2 / 10"
tt0848228,"The wait for this movie has been excruciatingly long, ever since we saw the preview that was attached to Captain America. Here's what I thought of the movie when I caught the premiere.You get the best of Joss Whedon and that is quite a lot:1. Black Widow is no longer just a piece of eye-candy. Did you seriously expect the creator of Buffy to just let his female characters stand around looking pretty? She kicks ass and how! (Yes, and it's about time!)2. For all the newbies out there that haven't watched some or all of the previous movies, the rest of the characters are thoroughly fleshed out. You get a long explanation about what they have been up to since their story last ended. So, it's possible that the first half may be a tad slow for the die-hard fans, but the second half more than makes up for it. Also, for what it's worth, isn't it better to know what the characters have been doing all this while, before they get down to some serious action?3. The post-credits scene. Oh My God! There is no point, whatsoever, in going to watch the movie if you don't wait for it. You simply HAVE to see it.4. On a side-note, if you're relatively new to the Marvel universe, you must see The Superhero Squad Show (Yes, it's a cartoon, and no, it's not a very serious one either. But looking past all that, it's a serious refresher course in everything Marvel) before the next movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe releases, as it really helps you understand the characters. I wouldn't have understood the importance of the post- credits scene without it.5. The fight sequences (the gist of which we all saw over and over again at Comic-Con!) finally makes it look like we are watching a superhero movie. It's not one until some old-fashioned ka-pow!6. And yes, there are many scenes which are a fanboy's (or girl's) most awesome-est dream come alive!You also, however, get the worst of Whedon, which I admit, I pretty much dreaded. I won't say what it is, as it will spoil it for you, but it's really very obvious if you've seen anything of Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Serenity and Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog (my opinion may not, however, be accurate, as some might argue that what we've seen is actually, his best) Whatever the general consensus, there is no doubt that Whedon gives his best shot at leaving his mark in the Marvel 'verse (!) and his best is pretty darn good!If I simply HAVE to find flaws in the movie, the only one I can think of right now is that some important Avengers - Ant-Man, Wasp, Black Panther and Vision - are nowhere to be seen. Black Widow was the only token female in this all-testosterone group, so Wasp would have been a welcome addition, as the scales would not be so unbalanced.The Avengers works because underneath all the larger-than-life heroes with their huge egos, their actions and emotions are just human enough to be believable. Things do not just fall in place - everybody does not magically get along with each other and fight away to glory - they had to work hard to make it happen. And that, is this movie's biggest USP.All-in-all, go watch the movie, if not on the first day, then at least some other time for as long as it's on in the theaters. Your first glimpse of this movie just HAS to be on the big screen."
tt1345836,"I still haven't read a credible defense of this turd. Overlong, overstuffed, lugubrious, and entirely nonsensical, I just don't get how anyone finds this enjoyable. The worst Batman movie since Batman & Robin, but at least that didn't take itself seriously."
tt0102926,"Revisiting movies from years ago, I watch this movie again. As I move forward, I see her getting older and older. Many things in the script that pass them over and are not answered.Both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are sublime, for me it's better than her. He has a character that gives much more play and squeezes to the maximum.It is still an action thriller more, yes with two huge actors, but with the passage of only a few years has become very old.I do not know the others but to me the constant use of the foreground and even the actors looking at camera, has taken me much of the film. The management does not seem very good, but the opposite, if it is true that entertains and does not bore, but if you do not realize that it abuses those plans, bad.The picture is quite normal, although at times it is quite good.If it is true that it has a huge setting. Especially the jail and the murderer's house are very well made.Spoiler:The scene where Anthony Hopkins bites the cop, for my taste, is very badly shot, does anyone believe that moment?"
tt0382568,"In his unbelievable show, Cem Yilmaz, a talent which emerges merely once in a millennium, alters the character of ""stand up"" to something which hasn't been described yet. Thus, a country's daily culture reflects on a show with every kind of gestures based upon pinpoint observations as no literature could afford to the date. Each observation also gives a code about its own context which helps to realize a standardized category of behaviors. Ironically his jokes and style especially in this magnum opus has affected many people in a way as if everybody is pretending to be a Cem Yilmaz while doing jokes. His extraordinary theatrical style also provided him the opportunity to become an actor and it was not less successful."
tt0111161,"Like i get it, i do. BUT it is not an 9.2 it's barely a 9, 8 at most. You may ask why that is, firstly Tim Robbins's performance was mediocre the only actor who really shined through was Morgan Freeman and that's just because of his charm. The directing was not interesting and the whole feeling from the movie is very hollywood like, you know not real."
tt0167260,"I'm a huge fan of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, but strangely enough I don't mind too much that liberties have been taken with the original story to suit Peter Jackson's cinematic rendering: I understand and accept that changes are inevitable when adapting such an epic work for the big screen. What I cannot forgive, however, is giving Legolas' superpowers during the Battle of Pelennor Fields and cutting out one of my favourite parts the book‚ÄîSaruman's fate (I know Christopher Lee feels the same way!).Watching a poorly rendered elf leaping around with impossible ease on a CGI 'oliphaunt' before killing all on board and sliding down the trunk (allowing Gimli to make another wisecrack) is going a step too far in my book, reminding me of the awful digital excesses that were to follow in Jackson's next film, King Kong (shudder); rounding off the film without showing us what happens to Lee's evil white wizard and his slimy pal Grima Wormtongue is an even worse decision, one that leaves fans of the book wondering whether they fell asleep before the end and missed an entire chunk (yeah, yeah, I know this bit is in the extended edition, but I'm talking about the version I paid to see at the cinema!).The Return of the King is still a very impressive effort, with stunning battle scenes, a genuinely creepy giant spider, an army of ghosts, and a thrilling climax that takes place inside an erupting volcano, and I'm grateful to all involved for realising what many considered to be totally un-filmable, but I really wanted the last chapter to be the best of the lot. And it isn't.Oh well, fingers crossed for The Hobbit..."
tt0111161,"I don¬¥t like movies about ""way of life"" or about a hope. In this movie is handled a problem with ""normal life"" or with resolution to take a life to ""own hands"". A topic of this film is such like Papillon. This is not an authentic subject, this is not an authentic movie...."
tt0120815,"I don't think anyone is ever going to argue how great that opening landing sequence is ¬ñ just the shear chaos in which those men were consumed ¬ñ I found the chaos comparable to the scene in `Platoon' where they assault the V.C. bunker¬Öhowever, it does not (any part of the movie, in my mind) match up the finale of Platoon, in which one is so confused, your heart pounds, and it is in the end more horrifying than any of the combat sequences in Private Ryan.What really got to me about this film, were several things though¬Öfirst and foremost, is the `dumb German' syndrome, which leaves me with a bias feeling.  Why in the end, did Miller, Ryan, and Sarge have know problem mowing down the by passing Germans, then survive the same gauntlet, with almost twenty German's firing at them?Another thing, is I couldn't help but notice how far people flew through the air whenever hit by a mortar, or stepped on a land mine¬Öor hit by a grenade¬Öso on, so on.  I won't pretend to be a war-vet, or someone who's witnessed this, but it seems unlikely to me.  However, I'll stress my own ignorance, and say `don't take my word for it.'All in all, I found it to be a worthy action flick ¬ñ comparable, in my mind, to `The Big Red one.'  It has sad moments, and moments of brutality, but in the end, just left me with impressed memories of some of the combat sequences.As a sidenote, I think that the best ww2 films ever made are ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" two films that don't deal heaviliy with combat (TTRL more so).  Saving Private Ryan tried just a little to hard to force feed it.  I recomend all of these films, but for your knowledge, those are to me, the best."
tt0111161,"The good points of this movie have already been stated in the other posts, so I will stick to the points I feel detracted from the movie. This movie never gripped me, I never really felt all that emotionally involved with the characters.  Even though 19 years passed in the story, I never got the sense of time passing as I have in other movies that have storylines that span decades.  All the characters who weren't prisoners were very one-dimensional.  Overall, it was a pretty good movie, but I don't think it belongs in the top 250."
tt0172495,"""Gladiator"", winner of the Best Picture Academy Award in 2001, is less a historical epic of swords, sandals, and the fate of a mighty empire, and more of a bloated B-movie about a guy with a gloomy face seeking revenge for the murder of his family. ""Death Wish"" in Ancient Rome, if you will.Thanks to director Ridley Scott it's a very pretty picture to look at: the icy blue light of a wintry Germanic battlefield, the amber hue of the emperor's throne room, and the Coliseum littered with rose petals like confetti. The many gruesome gladiatorial fight scenes are frenetically paced, visceral if not actually coherent. Some of the modern special effects, however, like the CGI cityscapes, look a bit crude, even by 1999's standards.The script, like most of the scripts that Ridley Scott works from, is strictly rough-draft material. The characters are shallow, the dialogue is stilted and awkward, and the story tries too hard to intertwine the drama of the Roman political arena with the action of the hero's central journey in the more literal arena -- the former scenes only serve as breathing room between the latter scenes, which are the real meat of the film. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix make the most out of their limited roles -- Crowe's terse delivery and brooding eyes establish his character better than the writer ever could -- but veterans Richard Harris and Oliver Reed nearly vanish into parts that ask too little of their great talents.In the end it doesn't feel like a proper epic: it's not the sort of epoch-defining story that spans years and continents and a huge historical canvas, like ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Spartacus"" were -- or Anthony Mann's ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" which told essentially the same story in 1964. It's not even ""Braveheart"", another gory, overblown revenge flick. It's trying to be big and important, but it has nothing important to say; its only purpose is to construct a framework for swordfights."
tt7286456,"This film has two sides of story:1. How cruel people can be with others, specially with dissadvantage/different people (in this case, with mental problems). This happens in real life and the film represents this cruel reality. It is a call to action.2. The second part is how delicate is the balance in those with mental health issues which can trigger disastreous consecuences: harm others.3. The third part, is the number of followers that a mentally impaired person can have. And that reminds me to the Catalan conflict, people following Catalan ""leaders"" who are full of lies who have end up believing their own lies, like Joker.Very good film."
tt0110912,"Tarantino does it again! From start to finish I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! The plot and dialog is so edgy and griping that I never wanted the movie to end.The only down side was all the story's in the movies where out of order which I know added to the suspense to the movie, but it also made it a little hard to follow and keep straight.Bruce Willies gives a great performance along side Samuel L Jackson, and John Travolta. A star studded cast that delivers as good as this one is bound to stand the test of time. I for one cannot wait to see what Tarantino comes out with next!"
tt0139414,"What can I say? I remember being utterly annoyed when I saw 'Lake Placid' years ago and hating it completely, and now, stumbling upon some glowing comments with 9s and 10s and anything above 5 attached to them, I thought I stretch my shaky memory, and put in my two cents on this rubbish!Yes, it's tongue'n'cheek! Yes, it's a B-grade monster movie that doesn't take itself too seriously- but even 'Eight Legged Freaks"" (another film I'm not a huge fan of) was way better than this! 'Deep Rising' is a masterpiece compared to this rubbish! At least the characters in that film took their premise a little more seriously! 'Lake Placid' is just simply not funny at all! There is no cleverness to the humour! Oliver Platt- irritating, Bill Pullman- bland, Bridget Fonda- hmmm, umm, boring, and Betty White- yes, swearing is super-funny, not! I don't get the love for this movie at all. It's not very funny, nor does it have heaps of death scenes to keep you entertained. And as for the crocodile- give me the computer-generated sharks in 'Deep Blue Sea' any day of the way (at least that film was rather funny, and didn't take itself too seriously either) or gimme an overly huge python in the almost-as-awful but ""actually"" B-grade 'Python' (which at least had Casper Van Dien with a moustache- come on? what more do want a film with a giant snake?)! Lake Placid had nothing going for it!Steve Miner, director of 'Friday the 13th Part 2', 'Friday the 13th Part 3' and 'Warlock' has made his worse film in 'Lake Placid'- heck, even 'Big Bully' was better than this unfunny ham-fisted bore-fest!

tt0163281,"A long time ago, in a galaxy we call the Milky Way, a new medium emerged that swept through humanity. What began life confined to universities invaded arcades, was then picked up by home computer junkies, and soon after blasted off onto home consoles, attracting crowds nationwide and beyond at a black hole's strength. For the next two decades, the computer junkies were left light-years away under the space bus, until the day that first-person shooters by a new company called id Software saw the starlight and took all media attention by a meteor storm. The junkies were, for the first time, assimilated into the gaming universe, and the console and arcade aliens decided that computer gaming was cool enough.Enough of the bad space puns, everyone - the gaming population at large, the press, the studios - wanted to hop on id Software's newfound train. No stranger to the phenomenon was LucasArts, who sought to imitate Doom's success with its first first-person shooter, Star Wars: Dark Forces. While not quite a killer app, it was successful as an early frontrunner to the genre, but part of its success owed to its having a strong story and objectives-based levels, as opposed to simply reaching the other end of the maps. On top of that, it allowed for ambient sounds, 3D models and sprites, and scripted combinations of these in ways that I will explain made the Jedi engine awesome back in the day. While the maps are still perpendicular and feature no slopes, the engine removed the infamous barrier to maps with room-over-room architecture, and players could look up and down (though only on a keyboard, but hacks and source ports work around that issue), as well as jump and crouch. Set in various scenarios, the maps have their own textures, a more practical architecture with elevators and rotating floors, and atmospheric lighting. Star Wars: Dark Forces would amass a small cult following of fans of the original and later Jedi Knight fans, and without further ado, let's find out what the devotion is about.The game starts off with Kyle Katarn, an Imperial officer-turned-Rebel mercenary, as he infiltrates an Imperial base on Danuta to steal the Death Star plans held there and deliver them to Princess Leia on board the Tantive IV (I guess it will take time for Disney to acknowledge at least some of his canonicity). The ingredients for a Star Wars-themed FPS are in place, but some things you will notice are that Dark Forces is slower-paced than Doom, though it need not be slow, and LucasArts' proprietary iMUSE system means that the music builds up and sustains tension when many enemies are alerted to Kyle's presence before relaxing when few, if any, are alerted. Such interactive music was unusual for an FPS game. There even apparently is music that was meant to be played when fighting certain enemies, which was scrapped due to problems making iMUSE play them on cue. Anyway, Kyle starts with his Bryar pistol, a basic yet surprisingly versatile weapon that can destroy many enemies with great accuracy, considering that there are eight other weapons to pick up that deal much more damage, the very next being the E-11 blaster rifle. The stormtrooper's rifle is comically not as accurate and more ammo-hungry, but still ends up being one of the most used weapons in the game. Kyle delivers the plans to the Rebellion, and the Death Star is destroyed. Clearly, that was just the prologue. This game takes place between the first two movies, and the Rebel Alliance learns of a swift, deadly capture of one of its bases on Talay, leading them to suspect a new ongoing Imperial project. On top of that, an Imperial officer named Crix Madine wishes to defect to the Rebels and provides crucial information about the project, known as the Dark Troopers, droids larger and more powerful than a stormtrooper. The rest of the game follows Kyle's adventures of finding clues, sabotaging the project, and destroying the starship harboring the droid factory, the Arc Hammer, while bumping into opposition from Imperials, criminals, bounty hunters, and droids at nearly every corner.As you progress, you will find more weapons that allow for alternative fire. Thermal detonators are a fairly common weapon that the player also ends up using often, and for good reasons. They are intuitive to throw, shooting farther the longer one holds down the fire button before releasing it, can be set to either explode on impact or after a 4-second delay, and can quickly clear unwanted pests. There are other weapons with similar or more firepower. Notably, mines can be set up to explode on proximity or after a delay, and there are ludicrously powerful weapons such as the Stoker concussion rifle, a.k.a. The Star Wars BFG 9000, and the Dark Trooper weapon. There are also surprises to encounter, such as the Dianoga, who hide in sewage and pop out to crunch their prey. I am not joking, they are creepy, especially after the player hears their low gargled growl, with the creepiest part only to come. The game also stars a few famous villains, and it challenges the player's problem-solving to get past puzzles without disrupting the pace. The best part is how the story is told as the levels go on, rather than in between. The levels are scripted for that purpose, requiring players to complete objectives such as picking up an item, reaching a destination, killing a boss, and so on and playing dialogue as one goes. Also, the automap is useful since sometimes I miss places I have not explored.Everyone in the 1990s who had a DOS home computer to play games on likely knew of id Software and its slew of inventive shooters, likely realizing that they and all successful imitators followed the rule of having a copious number of levels and room for user-generated levels, each with their own textures and sound. Wolfenstein 3D had 30 maze-like levels and let players design their own. Doom initially shipped with 27 levels and let players create their WADs. Descent had 30 levels bent on throwing gamers into disarray and let players design the most bizarre, most helter-skelter mines imaginable, all ending with the player destroying the core and escaping the mines' impending self-destruction in the style of Return of the Jedi. Funny that I mention that while reviewing a Star Wars game. Star Wars: Dark Forces has a paltry 14 levels. It is not a lot, and the game can be beaten in two days on average. Worse yet is the only thing that can keep it from being certified one of the greatest games: that Dark Forces is a single-player-only game. How did you miss the news of employees playing Doom online at work, LucasArts? Oh well, at least you recognized that players would naturally create their own levels in the GOB file format, which turned out to be a very good idea for reasons I shall explain.The Jedi engine is highly flexible, as demonstrated by the user-generated levels. I looked to the DF-21 fan website to test some of the greatest maps for the game, marking the first time I have played fan-made levels for the purpose of reviewing a game. My favorite are the Dark Tide saga and the Assassination on Nar Shaddaa mission featuring Boba Fett as the player character. The levels are not technically mods, as the core gameplay itself is unchanged (the player still behaves as Kyle Katarn, and his weapons are mechanically unchanged, as are the enemies and the world physics), but practically everything else can be modified. The Dark Tide saga has original music and full-motion video (including even an improved LucasArts opening sequence) and is particularly heavy on in-game storytelling, and Assassination features a high level of interactivity and an intricate money system for buying arms and health items not otherwise easily found lying throughout the map. In either case, the missions have original assets, more animated sprites and models, and clever scripting, such as glass walls breaking and their shards falling to the ground. The best levels I have tried are of LucasArts' standards, and my favorites may actually be better than the original game. These levels combine world sectors and models in ways that give the illusion that one is actually interacting with models or running up and down slopes, and also use plenty of sequenced visual and sound effects. Granted, the 3D engine's rendering is not perfect. The textured models when close up look as if they were viewed under a magnifying glass, and sprites over edges sometimes suffer clipping effects. Still, the skill involved makes the scenery all the impressive. I also like to turn the music off when I want the ambient sounds to fill the atmosphere for realism's sake, which there are many more of. One of the levels in the Dark Tide saga has the player controlling a droid, and another even simulates the effects of illness (in this case dizziness). The hacks used to create the levels, without once modding the game, are so creative that, from a technical standpoint, Dark Forces may be the greatest sprite-based Doom-clone ever made, greater than even - dare I say - Duke Nukem 3D and its Build engine. Praises to the Jedi Knight community for the levels and helping me review the game.VERDICT: After over a hundred hours of playing the game, studying its engine, and viewing the inner workings of the levels, I can safely see why Star Wars: Dark Forces amassed a cult following. It is a break from the norm of thrill-killing the bad guys that, by emphasizing plot development, better justifies the violence. While not influential like Half-Life, it was ahead of its time. Also, its 3D engine was magnificent, allowing for models, smooth animations, and complex, interactive structures. A little more budget would have made this a certified all-time classic, but, luckily, the developers did exactly that for the sequel, the first true Jedi game and one of the greatest games ever."
tt0381429,"Lantana was the last Australian film that managed to satisfy all the senses here in Australia. Sommersault hits the same heights not as dramatically and sophisticated in its story as Lantana was. But thats minor really, as how can you ultimately compare works of cinema. Sommersault is a fusion of the critical elements that make up a film sound, vision and performance. The way in which Cate has melded all the components together forms an amazing poetic journey, built around self destructive characters, outstanding cinematography and a sublime soundtrack. Sommersault feeds your soul! A worthy winner of all the 13 awards recently picked up at the AFI awards. Hopefully Sommersault will be given a wider audience it so readily deserves."
tt0137523,"I sat through the first half of this movie with my mouth open. It was so exciting, brilliant, a Fritz Lang for the new millennium. Edward Norton's face. That insomnia that he carries all over him is so magnificently drawn that creates the opposite effect on its audience. I was awake, very awake, sitting on the edge of my seat, devouring every moment, enjoying it like hell. Helena Bonham Carter was a like a great silent movie star doing her first talkie. Pola Negri, Theda Bara. As if this wan't enough, Brad Pitt, and Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt with all its fabulous connotations. Then, can you explain to me why I detested this movie? Why it made me so angry? Can you? I can only tell you that half way through I turned against the movie or the movie turned against me, either way I didn't like it. I felt cheated in the worse possible way. I felt treated like a moron. You start promising me the most unique film experience I've had in a long time but what you delivered was a tired, opportunistic, gimmicky, easy piece of nonsense. Why? David Fincher is one of the most consummated craftsmen American movies have ever had. Don't you agree? He can tell you a story, even something like ""Seven"", a horror thriller, in a way we've never seen before, at least half of it. He has an eye like no other. That's why my frustration. An artist like that putting himself at the service of something that's not done, not finished not worthy of his talents. You may think I'm being a bit too hard on the man. But let me tell you, it's out of love. I expect so much from him, I've seen what he is capable of. But so far have been only halves. Brilliantly acted, sensational to look at, but halves, just halves. He should look at Fritz Lang, Pietro Germi, Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Powell, William Wellman and naturally John Ford, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Fincher already inherited something from each one of them. Now the trick is that it isn't a trick. Half is better than nothing. But in the grand scheme of things, it's not enough."

tt1130884,I saw this movie yesterday. I have been looking forward to seeing it for months. Let me just say that I am a HUGE fan of Leo and Martin. I love almost everything they do. This movie however was disappointing and predictable. I knew where it was going and I spent the rest of the movie hoping for a change of direction that never came. What a letdown. This is the first review I have ever written for a movie and hopefully that shows all of you how important it was for me to say--DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. All of the praise I have read for this movie absolutely shocks me. The previews were actually better than the movie. It was not worth the price of admission. I hope this actor and director collaborate again and make a movie that can live up to the expectations that we have come to expect from movies such as The Departed.
tt0120737,"In making the movie, the creator decided he did NOT want to make a movie to please loyal fans of The Lord of the Rings. Rather, he was more concerned about maximizing its commercial appeal. In that regards, the three movies - The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and Return of the King - are successful. It tells a tale loosely based on the Tolkien classic. However, so many of the most basic facts are either eliminated or changed that by the time the Fellowship is formed -- beyond the names of the characters there is little resemblance to the trilogy created by J.R.R. Tolkien.The most egregious distortion is how Sauron was vanquished and The One Ring acquired - yes, the basis of the entire movie. The last alliance of Elves and Men came about after Sauron's forces had finally been driven back from dominion of Middle Earth and back to Mordor. A long and brutal siege of the evil wizard's tower, Barad - Dur ensued. In the end, Sauron himself came out.Perhaps the director had a problem envisioning what kind of battle must have transpired, but the greatest of the alliance battled Sauron up the slopes of Mount Doom, the volcano which forged The One Ring - Elendil, Isildur, Elrond among them. The director belittled the magnitude of the battle by having Isildur make a lucky swipe with a sword that cut off Sauron's fingers, thus separating him from the ring and making victory possible.Of course, if that were the case there would not have been a resurgence of Sauron. As anyone who has read the book knows, Sauron was beaten by force of arms, will, magic the full essence of what made the combatants great. Elendil's sword was broken when he fell upon it. Indeed, had it been shattered as they showed it would never have been reforged. Which is why Aragorn was able to carry it with him -- but that is among the more minor liberties the director took with his perversions.Isildur then cut the finger with The One Ring from Sauron's hand. The nature of the ring was that, in order to gain dominion over very powerful races, Sauron allowed the greater part of his strength flow into the Ring. Without it, he was diminished, but not killed. If being separated from the Ring vanquished him, then how was he able to come back? And wouldn't it have a much greater impact even on such a being as Sauron, to face the heir of the man who actually ""slew"" him, than the one who got a lucky shot.From that one major and totally unnecessary change, the connection between the movie and book was altered to such an extent that it was no longer the same.The other travesty was the failure to show the passage of time. It seemed that from the opening scenes of the party and Bilbo's farewell, and Frodo learning the secret of the Ring and his flight from the Shire, that perhaps a few months had passed. Quite the contrary, it was about 20 years that passed and Frodo used the Ring frequently. It's difficult to understand why the Ring had such an incredibly powerful hold.The list of unnecessary changes, omissions, senseless additions (Elves at Helm's Deep?) goes on and on. The director wanted to make the movie his own and capitalized on a popular title to do so.In and of itself, I suppose the movies do weave an acceptable yarn. However, for anyone who truly loved The Lord of the Rings, it is an unwatchable obscenity."
tt1853728,"Well lets come out and say it, this is an awful movie, I don't care what blinkered Tarantino fans say, this is trash. No one dare say anything against this guy , but hopefully one day someone other will seriously look at this and will see through the hype and say no the stuff he makes isn't pastiche of films from yester year, lets be fair about it , the movies of this ilk were crap then and nothing has changed. The camera shots are those of an amateur, the acting for most part is wooden, (Fox in particular acts like a Pinochio puppet with all the emotional charisma of clotted cream ) De Caprio is perhaps the only sparkle in this drab, very drab affair. The script is laughable and the repeated shots of the worst Kensington Gore I have ever seen being thrown up walls is quite truthfully childish. As for the end shots , surely a candidate for the raspberry awards. Sorry, if this thing had been made by anyone other than this director then audiences, even American ones, would have given it the thumbs down. But I guess all will hail this masterpiece of garbage and not see it for what it is. A poorly made piece of amateur stuff whose plot just doesn't hold up, made by actors who at times look embarrassed to be there, shame they were really."
tt0167261,"Oh, merciful heavens, what a horrid film!  I had serious problems with Fellowship, but I was able to overcome it eventually, and enjoy the movie on it's own terms.  But this...   this....!  To begin with, this should have had a disclaimer that the film was ""Inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's the Two Towers,"" so that geeks such as myself could've saved the $10.00 that I'll never see again, and preserved a fond childhood memory of spending time discovering a literary masterpiece.  I thought I had been scarred by the first film's brilliant dialogue, e.g.,""Let's hunt some Orc!""  (And many people who apparently love this film think George Lucas writes clunky lines!)  but this entire installment left me wanting to pluck out my eyes in a vain effort to cleanse myself.  Of course I see the need to condense a long novel to run within an alloted time, but that's not what happened here, they apparently felt that they could improve upon something that was already nearly perfect.  That was mistake number one.  Mistake number two was devoting a good portion of the film to Liv Tyler, for reasons unkown to me, since nowhere does her character appear in the book.  Other gripes: Turning the land of Rohan into a shanty hippie commune. Then feeling the need to show some hippie kids fleeing, in order to stir up some sympathy in the audience, is my only guess.  Suddenly finding myself in the middle wondering if the movie had stopped, and I was now watching a New Age music video (see Liv Tyler above), Enya, Enigma, something like that.  Half expecting Gandalf to turn into Max Von Sydow when King Theoden is ""possessed"" by Saruman, and begin bellowing, ""The power of Christ compels you!""  Aragorn dying, to be healed by Arwen (more Liv Tyler), and then awakened when the horsey starts kissing him.  Then there's the time that... Ugh!  I give up!  It's a shame too, because I've really liked Peter Jackson's work before this.   I just can't fathom his need to turn Tolkien's work into his own.  Sheesh, even Kubrick wasn't this bad!"
tt1345836,"I had very low expectations for this film before watching it and sadly this rubbish even failed to meet those.An appalling script completely lacking in a moral compass, subtext (imagine what an intelligent screen writer would have made of all of these orphans?) or clear motivations for the cartoon characters involved at the centre of the drama. As a result there was no tension and I didn't care if everyone was blown up at the end or not.The editing was appalling with one monochrome setting shifting to another in a very flat and monotonous rhythm. The action sequences were really dull. When the cops ran at the baddies the fight scene was as intense as two old ladies squabbling over a cardigan in the January sales! The road chase sequence was like a choreographed run through in a ""how to do a stunt"" video.The soundtrack music was a constant background burble that never actually developed into a theme and was as one dimensional as everything else in the film. Hans Zimmer's score was no match for the epic sweep of Danny Elfman's music in the Tim Burton Batman movies.The acting was disinterested and good actors such as Ben Mendelsohn and Marion Cotillard were wasted in one dimensional stereotypical roles. Ms Hathaway may have been surprisingly good at belting out a song in ""Les Mis"" but here she is the least sexy Cat Woman ever. To be fair to her that is hardly surprising from a Director as disinterested in sex appeal and human chemistry as Mr Nolan ( this is the guy who even made Scarlett Johansson dressed in corsets in ""The Prestige"" seem a little ordinary!!). What should have been highly charged emotional moments such as Alfred leaving Bruce or the public realisation of the sacrifice that Batman had made in the Harvey Dent affair were thrown away.The narrative was muddled, full of holes and lacking in tension. Just how did Bruce Wayne recover from a broken back, climb out of the pit and get back to Gotham on foot, with no resources at his disposal, from what I assume was somewhere like China in about 3 days? How did he get back into a shut down Gotham? As for the twist regarding who was Ra's Al Ghul's offspring ‚Äì well it obviously couldn't have been Bane because we were told his disfigurement and subsequent medical treatment took a much longer timescale well beyond the escape of that character. So that twist was telegraphed and in that situation when dealing with a script as mechanical as this one you always look to the least obvious character so to see Ms Cotilard declared as the offspring was as easy to anticipate as the fact that she wasn't going to finish Batman off when she had the chance. All as boring and predictable as the supposed poignant finale at the restaurant in Florence which you just knew would be the outcome. In Hollywood films the pay off always has to be signposted!Is this really the best we can expect for hundreds of $millions? A lame 140 minutes of nonsense followed by a final 20 minutes reliant on the same old tired device of a clock ticking down on the side of a bomb? Really??Intellectually Mr Nolan has nothing to offer the intelligent cinema goer (IMDb describes him as being ""celebral"" ‚Äì yes sure, to Homer Simpson maybe??!! ), emotionally he is clearly pitching his work at the level of a 14 year old school boy who's best friend is his X box and clearly on the basis of this dull waste of time and money he doesn't even have anything interesting to offer so far as technical film making is concerned.That this rubbish achieves 8.5 on IMDb is a perfect metaphor for the mindless consumerism and rampant stupidification of the western world. Honestly if this does it for you then you really need to grow up and read a few non-fiction books about politics, economics or philosophy¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö.. and perhaps even get yourself a real-life girlfriend."
tt0102926,The most over rated movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I can't believe this type of movies got this much star rating. Very disappointed.
tt0993846,"Well ... yawn.Here we have yet another Leo Dicaprio film where Leo Dicaprio plays Leo Dicaprio channelling someone or other and probably getting an Oscar as a result.I am sick to the back teeth of Leo Dicaprio films these days. He's not the only actor in the world. He's not even a particularly good character actor any more, as he always plays the same person in all his films. And all the films he's in seem to be about him.This aside, WOWS is a bad film. It's a long, long film. Seriously I don't think it was edited. It's a film that portrays a disgusting, degenerate, greed-driven conman who actually ruined the lives and futures of many, many REAL hard working people. And now he makes money while you watch this sordid bit of propaganda which essentially walks you through how he enjoyed wasting these ill-gotten gains and having sex and basically groping women along the way.But wait - this is where it mis-steps once again. He doesn't even ENJOY wasting the money he conned out of these people. In fact the film seems to be a walk-through of the life of a man who has everything, but isn't happy - at all - with his lot.Okay okay already! I get it - very rich and privileged people want you to know that it's a serious burden being rich. Wow, er ... thanks?That is literally the only point or message I can think to take away from this film.So if this sounds good to you - well - be my guest and add another wad load of cash to this guy's pension fund. I'll let you decide if you think anybody involved with this film deserves it.I've already made my mind up."
tt0993846,"well filmed, per the usual for Scorcese, funny in parts, but that's part of the problem, funny ha ha about massive greed and addiction?? The story is a mess as well, you really don't know why things are illegal, people really don't, on screen, suffer much from their addictions, there is little here that balances the celebratory with the downside so you never really get a sense of the actual consequences, in other words, the artistic message is muddled, characters come and go. Mostly we are shown a wonderful world of luxury with little real irony, no matter the feeble attempts to show the ""downside."" And what about the shipwreck??? that's a whole story in itself, yet it's treated like a lark. Maybe it's all suppose to be a cartoon fantasy, but this reeks of obtuseness given the massive inequalities in the US. Strange misfire from Scorcese."
tt0137523,"Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated."
tt0137523,"The cinematography in ""Fight Club"" is nothing short of exceptional. Every frame is meticulously composed, with a dark and gritty tone that perfectly matches the film's thematic elements. The use of lighting, camera angles, and visual effects adds depth and intensity to the narrative.The storytelling in ""Fight Club"" is both intriguing and thought-provoking. It delves into the complexities of modern consumer culture, existentialism, and the darker aspects of human nature. The film's exploration of identity, rebellion, and the blurred lines between reality and illusion is truly captivating.The entire film has a raw and edgy quality that immerses the audience in its world. The performances of the cast, particularly Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, are outstanding and contribute to the film's overall impact.""Fight Club"" is a cinematic experience that challenges conventions and leaves a lasting impression. It's a film that not only entertains but also sparks contemplation, making it a must-see for cinephiles and anyone looking for a movie that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and visual artistry."
tt1375666,"When crap is the norm, mediocrity will rule.Christopher Nolan is an average filmmaker and the praise he's getting for his lifeless, intellectually shallow and visually bland movies is truly perplexing.The concept of dreams, where you can do anything is reduced to guys in fancy suits shooting faceless goons. How imaginative, how clever, how intelligent. ""But, a city folds up!"" That's sure looks cool, if you're 12.The bastard child of M. Night Shyamalan and Michael Bay."
tt0361748,"Tarantino does it again. Although not my favorite Tanantino film, it's still really great!
If you've seen any of his previous work you know exactly what to expect.
Inglorious Basterds does some masterful buildup. It all builds up to that finale, which is satisfying and so worth the 2 hour wait.
Within the two hours before the finale contains some of the best character building i've seen, with some great acting (as usual, Tarantino knows exactly who he wants) that just make the film come alive. That combined with some tense action and some extremely suspenseful moments keep you on your toes the entire time. There's even a lot of humor in this which I wasn't expecting!Personally there are some points that I felt dragged, but I feel like this will be even better with a second watch, and make most of those moments feel more meaningful."
tt0120815,"The audio engineering and sound effects are the best of any war picture ever.  This is among many valid reasons why SAVING PVT RYAN is a must-see movie.  However, do not expect perfection.  Do not expect this film will live up to all of the hype.Briefly stated, members of the WWII generation spoke with a formality not captured in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  Unlike Hanks et al, Rock Hudson, Jimmy Stewart, Earnest Borgnine, and many old-time actors served in WWII.  Even more future writers, directors and Hollywood producers served as well. Their later film efforts accurately captured the feel of the times.  The difference is rather striking.  Please view any movie or even a TV production created by members of the Greatest Generation and see for yourself how it compares to RYAN.As unlikely as it may seem, one can even hold out ""Hogan's Heroes"" -- a light TV comedy set during WWII created in the early 60's by men who had experienced WWII -- as a Hollywood production better capturing the essence of WWII era interpersonal communication.  The characters in HOGAN naturally and automatically interacted with each other with the yes sir's and no sir's, personal respect and greater formality common in the 1940's.  Looking further, any Hollywood film produced in the 40's and 50's captured the essence of the day even better.Where a lightweight TV comedy succeeds, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN shockingly fails.  Characters in RYAN interact with the casual ease of 1998, and NOT with the formality common in the 1940's.  Rather than appearing to be part of the Greatest Generation, the actors in PRIVATE RYAN seem to be following the motivations of modern Hollywood producers who know only today's post Viet-Nam contempt, scorn and cynicism.  Speaking of cynicism, the subplot of the General's high class transport plane was completely made up in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN -- made up by a post Viet-Nam Hollywood."
tt0109842,"Boaz Yakin, the enormously talented writer/director of ""Fresh"" has done the impossible, a real movie about real things that offers a sharp contrast with other films about the subject we have seen before. Mr. Yakin working with what appears to be a cast of non professional actors, mainly, presents a gripping tale of life in the ghetto that will probably be a classic in this genre.If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading now.Fresh is the young boy at the center of the action. We follow him as he runs illegal drugs for the dealers of his area. Fresh comes from a broken home where the mother is not around and the father is absent from the picture. His kind aunt Frances has gathered about a dozen youngsters in the home she shares with her mother, who is the grandmother of all of them. In spite of the poor surroundings, this is a decent home.Fresh probably learned quickly in his young life he must be a step ahead of the drug dealers and their henchmen in order to survive in that world. It's a heavy trip for a young child to deal with in his own life and still have a head in his shoulders. What Fresh does, of course, is illegal, but this is a determined young man that is looking for a better future in spite of what he sees around him.Fresh loves to play chess. We watch him win games in Washington Square Park over more skilled players. Sam, his absent father, is a master of the game. Sam teaches his son the game and how to think the way the champions do. Sam is a highly intelligent man who has had the misfortune of falling victim to the bottle. His son, admires him but bears a resentment against him for abandoning him and Nicole, his sister. One thing is sure, Sam always wins when he plays Fresh. Only after all the big events at the end of the film, Fresh beats the old man up. In doing so, we see tears coming out of him because maybe then, Fresh realizes the enormity of the events he's been involved in, and the fact that his father, in yelling at him, perhaps shows the boy how much he cares for him.There is a scene in the film involving pit bull fighting that will make, even the coolest viewer cringe. Fresh's dog wins a match, but it is a menace that has to be put to sleep. The scene where Fresh hangs the dog by his collar is one of the most horrible things we watch in the movie. Fresh is venting his frustration at a dog he clearly loved, but now he cannot keep.The acting by all the principals is first rate. The only problem is that sometimes some of what he hear in the dialog is incomprehensible because of the use of street slang most of the viewers don't know. Sean Nelson makes a perfect Fresh. He is one of the most natural actors we have seen in a while. The lack of formal training works out as we watch a portrayal that is devoid of any mannerisms, or other cute poses that someone with more experience would have done with this role.Samuel L. Jackson makes another incredible appearance as Fresh's father Sam. Mr. Jackson's take on this man is an excellent example why he is on of the best actors working in films today. Giancarlo Esposito as Esteban, the nasty drug dealer, adds another great role to his brilliant film career.Adam Holender, the cinematographer, has given the film the right look. The dreamy scenes where Fresh is seen looking toward Manhattan at different times of the day, is pure poetry. This is an important movie dealing with an important subject. Thanks to Mr. Yakin, we go into that world that, for some of us, might as well be in another continent, but never right here in another part of town!"
tt1853728,"Yes, it's over the top nonsense.....but it's so watchable, funny and action packed. Some great acting also. Some of the 'critics' reviews are complete liberal nonsense. A must watch."
tt1853728,"Before I talk about this god awful movie let me give you a little history. I was contemplating whether or not to see django unchained, or gangster squad since Im a fan of both western and mobster movies. I liked westerns more so I went to see django unchained, and after this movie I was left with a frown on my face. This movie is nothing to me but a cheap brand of cow manure, I have no idea why everyone said this movie was good. Okay let me name the flaws 1 this movie says, it takes place two years before the civil war and they are using winchester, and colt guns that weren't developed until the second year of the war. 2 this movie is nothing more then a dumbass in distress movie LAME. 3 its just a bunch of racist jokes and satire humor thats not funny. 4 django is not an interesting character he barely does anything all he does is travel around being the bounty hunters sidekick, he doesn't do anything really interesting until the last 3rd of the movie. 5 this is a Tarantino film and he has a lot of cool action scenes in his movies like pulp fiction, and inglorious bastards, in this film you have 2 count them with me 2 action scenes in this movie. The only characters I remember finding interesting were the bounty hunter, played by Christoph Waltz and the henchman played by Samuel L Jackson, they are interesting but they aren't enough to save the movie. If you guys liked this movie good for you, but me this movie felt like it was trying to be a western but failed in my opinion I give this movie a 2 and hope that people notice my words in this critique."
tt0102926,The movie had its moments but for the most part it's unrealistic.
tt0167261,"I understand that many people don't think it is a valid criticism to say that this movie doesn't follow the book.  So let's set aside the book and look at this movie as a movie.  While it is beautifully shot and the acting is roughly equivalent to the first film, The Two Towers fails at crucial moments.  For example (SPOILERS):1.  First, and most important, the end of this film is not believable. The battle of Helm's Deep is a complete rout.  There are literally 10,000 orcs out on the plains in front of the fortress, and Aragorn decides to ride out with 10 men on horseback?!?  Then we see Gandalf up on a hill about 1/2 mile away, on the other side of the orc army, charging forward with what appears to be a couple hundred men.  The way this battle is staged, Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas and Gimli must die.  I didn't think Gandalf would make it past the first row of spears set in the ground.  And are we supposed to believe that 10,000 orcs, including numerous archers who are standing within 100 yards of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, all turn around and completely ignore our heroes when Gandalf charges?  Isn't it a tad more likely that our heroes are immediately pelted with thousands of arrows?  This battle is insulting to the audience's intelligence.  Mr. Jackson fades the battle out, as he must, because there is no way that the forces of good are going to win.  This is not a minor problem.  Mr. Jackson has chosen to make the battle at Helm's Deep the climax of this film.  The fact that this climax is not credible is a serious flaw in this film, and one that I just couldn't overlook.2.  Mr. Jackson's decision to use the battle of Helm's Deep as the climax of his film meant that he had to spend an inordinate amount of time showing people shuffling toward the fortress, shuffling into the fortress, sitting in alley ways, getting weapons, missing Aragorn, rejoicing when Aragorn comes back . . . .  There is no real action or character development going on during this hour of screen time.  This build up could have been replaced with something more essential to the storyline.3.  Treebeard and the other Ents take half a day to pronounce someone's name.  They have stood in the forest for thousands of years and seen countless trees fall and be destroyed.  Yet, for some reason, they rashly decide to wreak havoc on Saruman because he has destroyed what looks to be about 50 feet of treeline.  Not very consistent with their character, so why do they do it?  The only reason I could discern is that Mr. Jackson wants us to think that Merry has done something clever for once.  This thin reed of justification cannot support such an obvious break from character.4.  Aragorn being dragged over the cliff by a worg served two obvious purposes.  First, we get to see that Eowyn loves him.  But we knew that already.  Second, he spots the army of orcs.  We knew that as well. Further, the fall over the cliff feels crassly manipulative.  We don't seriously believe that Aragorn is dead, but we are forced to watch the characters display their grief.  Ugh.  I wish this screen time had been used for any other purpose.5.  Faramir's decision to bring Frodo into Gondor seemed like a pointless detour, and, sadly, one that inadvertantly led to some mighty contrived acting by Elijah Wood.  Ian Holm and the computer-generated Gollum are fine when showing the pull of the ring's power, but the ring seems to make Mr. Wood stare into space.  Also, what exactly is it that changes Faramir's mind?  Seeing Frodo try to give the ring to a ringwraith convinces Faramir that he should let Frodo continue to carry the ring into Mordor? Huh?What do all these flaws have in common?  None of them are in the books. Tolkien spent literally decades crafting his trilogy.  I understand that some things must be cut from the books for the sake of time.  Mr. Jackson showed admirable discretion in the first film, which was a compelling adaptation of the novel.  This film falls far short.  It is still beautifully rendered, but that is not enough to save a film riddled with flaws.I was sorely disappointed by this picture."
tt0114369,Pretty average movie idk what makes it it's fans to give high rating.
tt1375666,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***May be I expected too much from this movie, which was supposed to ""change the way I see things"". Well, it did not change anything, and certainly not the way I look at things. May be it changed the way I look at people who think this is the best movie ever made.It's long, tedious, they go through layers after layers, why, we do not really know. The characters are numerous, flat, (some may argue that this is a dream so they are supposed to be flat), but strangely enough they are quite consistent, they never change, which is not consistent at least with my dreams.And if you ask people why this movie is so fascinating and ""complex"", you might end up with the following conversation:""it can not be explained with words, it's a story about a guy who gather a team to go through different layer of dreams to alter, blah.""""Yes, I got that and?""""But I can't tell you the whole plot, I might spoil it""""I saw it, try me.""""Euh, his wife blah blah... about the dream thing, life, death, redemption, there are so many themes in this movie""""And?""""Euh, I don't know, you need to think.""""Ah...""I guess many people confuse complexity and redundancy. These guys just go through layers and layers of dreams, wrapped non-sense pseudo-scientific verbiage. Than he sees his wife again and again, and ""kicks"" back again and again, fights again bad guys again and again. And what? This is not complex, this is redundant and boring!Many people mentioned to me that there was a trick at the end of the movie... Actually, the end is a kind of pale copy of Orange Clockwork ending, and you can expect the trick from the beginning. Orange clockwork, the hurt locker, usual suspect, this is how you end a movie, and I did not see it coming from the first 15 minutes of the movie.In the category ""the director tries to drive you crazy"", Donnie Darko, Mulholland drive and, if we stick to Nolan universe, Memento gets my vote, not Inception. Or go watch Matrix again, or Dark city, or whatever movie you want to, that lasts less than 2 hours.Bottom line, I was bored during the projection, and that's one of the worst movie I've ever seen. 2 points because I did not leave (which makes it a better movie than Titanic to me)."
tt0139414,"I love genre-bending movies, and especially those that mix horror with comedy. That puts me dead center of the target demographic of this film. The plot is pretty silly and there certainly isn't enough action for anyone looking for scares. What saves it is the script. It's witty and never takes itself too seriously. The characters are all foils for one another, setting up some of the most entertaining dialog of any movie I know.The plot revolves around a 30 foot Asian crocodile somehow winding up in a lake in Maine - go figure. What makes the movie are the characters assembled to do something about it. Bridget Fonda is an annoying paleontologist who's never before ventured out of her museum. Here, she plays both the archetypal fish out of water as well as potential romantic interest for the local game warden, played by Bill Pullman. The essential characters are rounded out by Brendan Gleeson's dour sheriff, Oliver Platt's rich and eccentric mythology buff, and Betty White as the colorful local little old lady with a secret or two.As I said, reduced to a plot outline, it's pretty unimpressive, but the verbal barbs that fly back and forth between the characters are what make the show. It's an ""action/horror"" movie I could watch with my eyes shut and still enjoy."
tt0109830,"Well, if you are in the mood for a hollow ""feel good movie"" this will fit the bill. But if you are looking for substance, or a film that makes you think, this film will leave you knowing you can never get the time back you just spent watching this movie. The soundtrack probably causes movie-goers to connect to the film more than the flimsy plot.At the time this film was released, Hanks was perhaps the most sought after leading man. In some ways, it is as though the studios were on a quest to turn him into his generation's Jimmy Stewart. Hanks is a solid actor, and has acted in many excellent roles, but this is not one of them. But this film certainly helped launch the ""Bubba Gump Shrimp Company Restaurant"" found at tourist traps all across the United States. In many ways, that is this film's legacy - made for theater tourist looking for a vacation for the mind."
tt0381429,"Sommersault is captivating cinema. That rare kind that straddles the divide between art-house and accessible, moving drama.Sommersault stays with you after watching. Beyond the great performances, direction and stellar script, it has a mystical quality that creeps under your skin. This quality seems to me the make-believe world of discovery main female lead - Heidi (Abbie Cornish), on the verge of womanhood, inhabits.Heidis drifting keeps her just enough removed from the unfamiliar and potentially brutal world of the Snowy Mountains, NSW, Australia. Her drifting ultimately seems to spell her survival; through indifference, or perhaps her difference, she can see a way out of a town that holds no answers.An interesting side-note, also mentioned in the film, is that an entire town nearby the location and the films setting was dammed to power the Snowy Hydro Electric Scheme - in development since 1949 and completed in 1974. Ranked as one of the the great engineering achievements of the century by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1967 and 1997, the dam engulfed an entire town; buildings, houses, shops, churches, streets and all, and claimed more than 120 lives.To me this speaks volumes about the modern world white Australia is still so eager to become and which Heidi thrusts herself into; with it's hidden stories and volition enough to envelope all in its path.Sommersault carries you through Heidis journey, all ambiguity and questions intact, and leaves you with a rare authentic experience all too familiar in life, yet rare in cinema."
tt0848228,"Superhero movies have been the craze for a while now. Sure, they've always been around, but now they seem to be coming out in droves. Either a new hero to make a movie for, yet another sequel to an existing series (Batman 1-3, Spiderman 1-3, Amazing Spiderman 1-2, Iron Man 1-3, Captain America 1-2, Thor 1-2, and the extensive X-Men series to name a few), or another reboot. Yes, they are popular, but for the most part extremely formulaic. Other than Nolan's Batman series there is not much new in any of those movies, and the Avengers is no different. Maybe even worse.Everything you expect to see in the Avengers, you will see. Some snappy one-liners from Downey Jr., explosions, an excessive use of CGI, good guys win, bad guys lose, dot dot dot. I think I've seen this one before. There is no creativity, no thought, nothing really. If you enjoy movies that require no thought, this one is for you.And the hype? I put this up there with the Fast & the Furious, it's THAT bad, yet so many people seem to love it. Are we really that unimaginative and dull? It's only exciting if you can't see past the CGI and battle scenes.If you would like to watch a 'superhero' movie with actual substance, Watchmen is a terrific example, they are the 'anti-Avengers' if you will. Enough with these cookie-cutter characters please. Don't waste your time on this one."
tt1130884,"Leave what you are doing right now and watch this masterpiece, it blew the fuck out of my mind to the point where I have no idea how to describe it with justice. Everything about it, is insane. From the plot to the cinematography to the acting to LITERALLY EVERYTHING, INSANE!!!! The ending its self will leave you questioning yourself, it immediately entered my top favorite movies list of alllllllllllll time. Leo never fails to amaze me<3this man is seriously a living legend.GO WATCH IT NOWWWWWWWWWWWW."
tt0480025,"This movie goes from cheesy to fantastic. The first ten minutes are long, but once the story starts to develop, it grabs you and doesn't let go."
tt0068646,"I thought the book was overdone and corny when I read it in 71; and I thought the movie was overacted and bordered on fantasy when I saw it in 72.Having spent 22 years in a major city's police department, I had occasion to deal with these mob types now and again. They are nothing like those portrayed in the film. They are hollow shells of men who somehow know their bravado is a sham.There are some good action scenes in the picture, but I find the constant atmosphere of universal admiration of thuggery to be aimed at the juvenile patron."
tt0468569,"I guess I missed the warning on the label.""You must be at least this shallow to enjoy the film."" This movie had no depth, although it really, really wants you to think that it does.Michael Caine was very good in this film. So was Morgan Freeman.But everything else was just so hollow. Nothing to draw one into the characters.And then the utter repetitiveness of the whole film. The Joker is a bad guy. The message which was relayed in the opening scene was then repeated again, and again, and again, and...And yet through all of this, they couldn't manage to put forth a story that was interesting. Nothing at all. Just excuses for special effects.Not as bad as Spiderman 3, but a really, really overrated film. Heath Ledger acts crazy throughout the film, but in a very, very two dimensional way.Ironic that a movie featuring a character called the Joker failed to have any laughs in it whatsoever.The first re-invented film was good. Things happened for a reason. Things happened that were surprising. Editing occurred.I would rather watch Adam West's Batman, than this. Those stories eventually got to the point."
tt0120737,"Firstly, I have to say that this film is an epic adventure that truly transports you to a magical world. From the stunning scenery of New Zealand to the intricate details of the costumes and sets, every aspect of the production is absolutely mesmerizing. The music, composed by Howard Shore, is also one of the best movie soundtracks ever made and perfectly complements the action on screen.In terms of the storyline, The Fellowship of the Ring follows Frodo Baggins, a hobbit who has been entrusted with the task of destroying the One Ring, a powerful artifact that could bring about the end of the world if it falls into the wrong hands. Along with a diverse group of companions, including elves, dwarves, humans, and other hobbits, Frodo sets out on a perilous journey to Mordor, the land of the evil Lord Sauron who seeks to reclaim the ring.The film is full of action and adventure, with stunning fight scenes and incredible visual effects. However, at times it can also be slow-moving and somewhat tedious, especially during the scenes of exposition or when the characters are simply walking and talking. Additionally, some viewers may find the film to be overly long and perhaps even a bit convoluted, particularly if they are not familiar with the source material.That being said, the film's characters are incredibly well-crafted and the acting is superb. Elijah Wood delivers a nuanced and heartfelt performance as Frodo, while Ian McKellen is perfectly cast as the wise and powerful wizard, Gandalf. The rest of the ensemble cast, including Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, and Orlando Bloom, also deliver standout performances.In conclusion, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Extended) is a visually stunning and epic adventure that is sure to capture the imaginations of fans of the fantasy genre. While it can be slow at times and perhaps a bit overwhelming for some viewers, it is ultimately a well-crafted and entertaining film that is definitely worth watching."
tt0068646,"I guess the same kind of folks who made The Sopranos one of the highest-rated TV shows in history made this film a 9.2 on IMDb. I sure don't get it. I think there is also a slight bias towards rating longer movies higher. Quantity does not equal, or compensate for the lack of, quality.Star-studded cast? Check. Outstanding director? Check. Dramatic and compelling plot? No.A drama should be dramatic. It should be compelling. We should care about the outcome. This film achieved none of those objectives.Some have lauded it as a fantastic sketch of organized crime. I suppose if you think of it more as a fictional docudrama, maybe your expectations would allow you to enjoy it more.The only compelling aspect of the film was the progression of Michael Corleone. The movie did bring that full circle, and I will dance around the details here to avoid spoilers. Nevertheless, that one somewhat interesting aspect was not enough to redeem the movie. And even in that aspect, the film did nothing to make the viewer CARE about Michael or why he evolved as he did.About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very Good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A Classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating)"
tt0468569,It's a good flick but it tries too hard and doesn't live up to the hype. One of the highest ranked movies on IMDb. I don't think it's quite that good.
tt0110912,"Simply put Pulp Fiction is the silliest film I have every seen, it puts 
 Battlefield Earth and The Long Kiss Goodnight (spookily starring the 
 two leads from this film) firmly in the shadows, they look like rare 
 vintage wines next to this cheap plonk. The fact it is so highly 
 revered by so many, and even considered profound, makes me fear for the 
 very existence of modern society.
 
 There are some fundamental reasons I dislike this film with a passion, 
 the first being the pacing and substance, the film really mirrors it's 
 director to perfection, yapping and a mumblin and a stumblin from start 
 to finish, enthusiastically about....Nothing! If Qentin was not such an 
 untalented, cretinous buffoon I would call him the new David Lynch. The 
 only substance in PF is of the white powdery verity, the film is just a 
 collection of sick images splashed on screen willy nilly strung loosely 
 together by some sharp but pointless dialogue. The film was too crude, 
 made purely for shock value. When violence, male rape, drug abuse, 
 accidental shootings and other such fun filled things are packaged as 
 cool and even as comedy in the hands of an immature director you get a 
 highly irresponsible film, and to sell it as some sort of 'smart art' 
 piece is doubly irresponsible.
 
 Then there is the complete lack of character development and depth. 
 There are no characters, only 2 dimensional machines created solely to 
 perform acts of severe violence and drop in a few wise cracks, they 
 perform actions in one scene that seem to have no effect or relation to 
 what happens in their next scene. Not one of them is even slightly 
 likable or in possession of any redeemable characteristics apart from 
 perhaps Butch (Willis), did I mention he is a violent thug, murderer 
 and a thief? Then there is Mia who seems to have little purpose in the 
 film other than an excuse to include the very uncomfortable scene where 
 an over weight Travolta boogies on the dance floor. Yes she is in the 
 'famous' needle scene as well, but what else? The section featuring 
 Vince and Mia was just dropped and barely mentioned again like Mia 
 herself, so what was the point? A question I asked of the film 
 throughout. I quickly realised that nobody in the film was there to be 
 developed, any one of them could have been dropped (apart from Butch) 
 or their actions performed by a completely new character without making 
 a spot of difference to the film, their actions were not to be the 
 subject of scrutiny. That would be asking too much of the Tarantino who 
 is clearly only interested in attempting to make stuff look cool. He is 
 the most unoriginal man on the planet only capable of tacky 'homage' 
 (ie, he is a thief) action films. Don't believe me? Watch Kill Bill 
 where he even pays homage to his own film, this one! I do give credit 
 to him in one respect. He realised that if he re-jigged the order of 
 plot events he could not only look artistically swish but he could 
 disguise the fact that the story is not worth the toilet paper it was 
 written on, impressing upon many the fallacy that the hack job 
 narrative structure enhanced the story.
 
 The direction is experimental but quite frankly tacky and laughable at 
 times. One scene featuring a near comatose Butch in particular comes to 
 mind, the camera is stuck dead still on him while Marsellus (Rhames) 
 uses the m-f word 100 times in about 5 minutes, totally amateurish. The 
 only memorable performance is from Jackson, who could make the 
 ingredients list of a packet of cookies sound fun, he is offset by a 
 flat performance from Travolta. That brings me to the 'witty' dialogue 
 which, apart from the violence, is the crux of the piece. It is 
 unfortunate then, that this dialogue basically consists of idiots 
 talking a load of nonsense about such deep things as cheeseburgers, 
 milkshake, foot massages, cleaning up skull and brain chunks and some 
 coffee that is described as gourmet s**t. Some dialogue was witty but 
 mostly it was just utterly pointless, the characters deliver it with 
 such perceived style and coolness despite the fact they were talking 
 about, frankly, a lot of BS. Add this to the fact there is (barring 
 brief moments in Butch's story) no plot, no emotion and especially no 
 substance and you have one worthless film. ""Ah you don't get it"" they 
 all scream, don't make me laugh, the circular narrative and the 
 ham-fisted attempt at redemption at the end does not equal substance. 
 The ending was hilariously cheap, obviously a desperate attempt to 
 justify a pointless 2 hour string of images in one strike. Is it meant 
 to be profound? Well after sitting through the whole film which 
 consisted of characters that were never developed adequately, where no 
 actions or events were properly tackled, challenged or explored with 
 any great thought or depth during which I was never required to care 
 even once, I was presented with one of the most cheesy, pointless 
 monologues in film history. Oh and a parody of QT's fans - the 
 briefcase is opened and they stare at the shiny thing and go ""ooooh, it 
 beautiful"". It is all a hollow gesture when you consider the character 
 that delivers the speech and his actions directly following it, 
 combined with the entire sequence of stupid events that precede it. 
 Many movies these days suffer similar problems at their conclusion 
 because of obvious limitations in plot structure and development, some 
 have endings that invalidate the rest of the film, others have endings 
 that are invalidated by the rest of the film, with Pulp Fiction QT has 
 somehow achieved both simultaneously. You'll figure out what I mean. As 
 a rule I don't usually let a film's director put me off the film itself 
 but, after Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, Tarantino films are now the 
 exception."
tt1853728,"Tarantino's best movies were Pulp Fiction, True Romance and Reservoir Dogs.Tarantino's last few films have been the same old recycled crap. Basically the story is about someone being wronged and then that person takes violent revenge on everyone to blame for the rest of the film. Over and over Tarantino is spewing the same old story with gratuitously violent scenes. Kill Bill, Inglorious Bastards, and now Django are all the same story. I think Django is getting a lot of buzz because it deals with slavery. I found Django to be sleepy and boring. The cameo Tarantino treats audiences to is useless and unnecessary. The gratuitous violence is acceptable because the people killed are big, bad, white slave owners (yawn).Django is not a great film. Really, it isn't. Don't be such a follower and pretend you enjoy it like the rest of the herd. Go see Pulp Fiction or True Romance if you want to see a great Tarantino flick."
tt7286456,"All hype and no substance. A pretty mediocre movie hyped up for no reason. Worth a watch if you have a few free hours to spare with nothing better to do or watch, but to rate this above 5 is just crazy."
tt7286456,"Joker is anything but a masterpiece, although it certainly takes itself seriously enough and it tries harder than any movie in recent memory to be one (maybe the recent Star is Born tries harder). But I found it largely languorous, psychopathic in its intent and subsequent failure to move me on any level and, well, not worth even a laugh.I don't know what the point of this film is, since it doesn't really work as Batman lore, providing a shoddy psychological construct around the Joker's origins, and if the idea was to top either Nicholson or Ledger it failed me (Nolan's Joker vision is far more nihilistic, seemingly coming from nowhere, with a twisted, brutal sense of humor about him.) Here we are meant to empathize with poor disgruntled Arthur Fleck, which might have been easier had he not been fed so many obvious motivations for his disgruntlement, and propped up by such lazy writing.If Joker is meant to 'be a mirror' to our times, it fails again, to say anything relevant or novel about society, or about the US, or the mental health system or anything really that hasn't been said a million times before, and instead seems focused on taking itself really really seriously, and wants us to find sequences of the Joker dancing to Gary Glitter edgy and bombastic, when really these sequences are dull and incongruent deadweight.Fans will lambast the haters of this film, but frankly I was bored by its flat embrace of pointless amorality. I wanted better, more biting satire, more layers, more motivation. Instead we get superficial, ultra-violent and pointless dreck which says and means nothing, even while it looks swell, has a great cast and seemingly all the ingredients are in order. But maybe that's the trade off for giving the reigns of such a film to the Hangover director."
tt0114369,"This movie is one of the most over-hyped I've ever seen (#43 in IMDb!). Seeing the trailer let one know (and guess) at least 60% of the movie, the end is more or less clear about 20 minutes before it happens and absolutely clear about 5 minutes.This brings me to another point: the plot fills this more-than-2-hour-movie as Brad Pitt would fill the clothes of the Gluttony-victim. There are too many sequences that seem just stretched and which do nothing for plot or character development.All in all: could've been a decent 90-minute movie, and I've seen many worse but it's definitely not worth more than 5 points. I gave it 4 (-1 for being over-hyped)."
tt0167260,"If we consider The Fellowship of the Ring is a history, we could consider The Two Towers as a legend,and we could consider The Retern of the King as a myth."
tt1130884,"Opening with some rather amateur special effects to create a ferry trip was an unusually, off-putting experience, especially from the likes of Scorsese. But as 'Shutter Island' progressed, I was soon immersed into the mystery of the missing suspect.Leonardo Dicaprio played an engrossing detective with an unbridled drive and determination that often clouded his judgement, but with the reluctance of Mark Ruffalo was kept sensible.The first half never dragged as it introduced new and interesting characters that added to the curiosity of the island which was also helped with typically Gothic set design.Unfortunately the second half became slow and confusing with an unambitious push towards the disappointing and predictable ending.I would have preferred to watch the first half of the film, stopped it and left the ending as a mystery for my imagination."
tt0102926,"Such a boring movie.  Not much seemed to happen until the end, which was OK. The reason behind why the guy was killing the ladies was the stupidest thing I have ever heard.  Hannibal Lecter's character and his escape scene were really the only things I liked in the whole film.  It pretty much sucked."
tt0468569,"When I read the enthusiastic reviews in Italy and I saw this movie ranked 1st in the IMDb's Top 250, I thought: ""It's strange, the other Batman (Begins) was not so brilliant, what's happening with this sequel? Is it really this masterpiece? Is it really in the same league with movies like 'Clockwork Orange' or 'Apocalypse now'?"". No, it's not in the same league. Not at all. When I saw it, my delusion was strong. It's a good blockbuster action movie, but nothing more. Let's see.The following comments contain spoilers. Be careful.The script is not so original. There are tons of action sequences, but¬Ö what can I say? I've seen it all. I've seen the robbery made by violent people, fighting against the guards and killing each others (in all pulp tradition, since ""Reservoir Dogs""). I've seen the ransom in China by plane (""Spy Games""). I've seen those action sequences with cars and armored vehicles in all American movies. (And this Batmobile is really awkward). I've seen the killer who kills by chance (""No Country for Old Men""). I've seen the super-mega-sadistic-mad-chaotic-evil-serial-killer in action who creates dilemmas and plays with his victims (in ""Seven"" and in the ""Saw"" saga). I've seen it all: ""The Dark Knight"" is nothing new. And it's very predictable: you really can predict any sequence before seeing it. There are a lot of absurdities. The heroes could kill The Joleker dozens of times, but they never do it. Why? Are they retarded? The ""two ships dilemma"" (I don't want to reveal more about that scene) is not realistic at all. There are only a couple of surprises, but the 2/3 of the movie doesn't create any suspense. What about the actors? The only two heroes of acting in this movie are Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart. Heath Ledger, with his Joker, bears quite the entire movie. All the other characters became secondary. Aaron Eckhart is really powerful and he confirms his talent shown in ""Thank You for Smoking"". What about the others? Christian Bale is one of the most talented actors of his generation, but in this movie he keeps only one expression all the time, with or without mask. His Batman has no personality. Maggie Gyllenhaal is one of the most interesting (and underrated) independent actresses of the New Hollywood, since ""The Secretary"". But in this movie she can act only in few sequences and she has no chance to show her real talent. Morgan Freeman and Michael Cane are giants, but in this movie they barely appear. Finally: I've never seen so many waste of talent! The good side of the coin in Christopher Nolan's work is: his philosophy. It's really positive and constructive and all his movie is coherent about it. It's just like the positive answer to ""No Country for Old Men"" and to modern nihilism: in the Cohen's movie, Evil is the absence of values and it's unstoppable. In ""The Dark Knight"", Evil is again the absence of values, but it's a minority, not the rule. So, we can fight Evil and defeat it, with or without super-heroes. But all those themes could be and should be explored better. ""The Dark Knight"" explores nothing."
tt0361748,"From the moment this movie starts the score already gives an epic feeling. The first scene is so strong and somehow this level is maintained throughout the movie. Tarantino absolutely excels with this film. The story is great, but almost 2nd to the performance. Most actors are great, however it's Christoph Waltz that takes his role to the next level..One word of precaution: there is the quintessential Quentin level of violence mixed with outstanding dialogue. Think reservoir dogs.Personal Note: It's a film I watched coz of the IMDB 250 and I couldn't be happier. Without it; I would have probably not chosen to put it on that quickly. And this is one of those film that really gives credit to the quality of the list (with a few exceptions)."
tt0848228,"Entertaining, but lacks depth. I like my superhero movies a bit more darker and maturer. This has too many cheap jokes for my taste."
tt1375666,"Not much more to add really. I managed to watch this farce for about half an hour, I desperately wanted to give it a chance, but every passing minute is such an insult to my intelligence that I cannot carry on. Then I tried again to continue, because I thought it's not fair to rate a movie without watching it to the end. But then again, I'm not a masochist.This film is the perfect example of how movie success depends hardly on movie quality, but almost solely on marketing. The same happened with the Matrix a few years back. Farcical setting, totally unrealistic story, but great marketing: Box office success.You probably already know the deal, unfortunately I was unsuspecting before I tried to watch it: Getting into other people's dreams, creating a believable world in the dream where multiple dreamers can interact with each other, and in this way, collect important information from the mark. Of course the dreams also have dreams within, and it's hard to know what is real and when your're dreaming.Whatever. No idea why anyone would WANT to watch this, other than because of the hype. But the hype has very little to do with the quality of the film.This film's whole focus is on the farcical notion of creating dreams for people, and especially, interacting with other characters in the dream who are dreaming the exact same dream. If the film were not so consumed by this outragous technicality, and it had some character and heart, some sort of purpose, I could probably let slip the ridiculousness of the whole theme. I have been known to enjoy the odd sci-fi. But it lacks any heart, all it does is try to look smart.I find it grossly unfair that this junk rates above 9 on IMDb. However, my rating of 2 is not because I want to bring the total down, it is rather what I think the realistic rating is. And that 2 is a very generous score."
tt1130884,"I loved the look of this film, but was aware from the beginning that ""our hero"" was not what he seemed, when the water made him sick and he just met his ""partner"" on the ferry out to the island. As it went along I pretty much knew how the story was gonna go, and was proved right.Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable film even if it's been done before with different details. Maybe I read too many books, and watch old films too much, but I find it surprisingly easy to predict the stories of these "" Dolly-wood tries to be clever"" films.Lovely cast and still a great watch, cinematography great, but all the over the top tension building music in the beginning was intensely annoying, even though I understood what they were trying to do.I'll watch this film every five years or so, worth buying when it's on the eight dollar shelf."
tt1853728,"Sometimes the German equivalent of the MPAA can surprise us all. Not only did this movie get a rating (uncut), it also passed with a ""16"". I'm always happy, when they pass a movie uncut, so I won't complain. That doesn't mean, I'm not wondering what is going on in the heads of some of those people who decide what rating a movie gets. The movie even got some heat in America for its violence (then again it also got some heat, because of its male lead. One party decided it wasn't a good example for white people to be killed by a black guy, the other side thought it was unfair in its depiction of black people and so forth)! Saying it lead to people becoming violent(?).Apart from those discussions, what can be said, is that Tarantino did it again. A great movie, with superb performances by everyone involved. Who'd have thought Kerry Washington would have to learn German for a role? Not me, but the inclusion of Waltz, Tarantino favorite and rightfully so, made this happen. And while Waltz almost steals the movie, it's still very much a Jamie Foxx picture."
tt0816692,"Overall, ""Interstellar"" was an underwhelming experience for me.The film spent too much time establishing characters and relationships that in the end just felt unconvincing and contrived.It was full of wooden dialogue. The parts in which the scientists dropped basic astrophysical knowledge in a Wikipedia-like diction were cringeworthy.The conclusions to which they jumped (aliens put the wormhole there to save the human race, love has to be the fifth dimension) rendered these characters completely unbelievable to me.The turn of events by which Cooper came to be the chosen pilot of the spacecraft, that was probably the most painfully impotent writing I have ever seen in a large budget movie.The film completely failed to show the space pioneers having any sense of awe in light of the incredible things they were witnessing. When Cooper was told about the existence of a wormhole near Saturn and the habitable planets on the other side, he took it like a boring lecture and the most obvious thing ever. This grotesquely ignorant attitude was visible throughout the whole movie. Characters only ever showed care and concern for their own families or abstract concepts like ""the human race"". I found this totally anthropocentric perspective not credible at all and highly unlikeable.However, when the spacecraft passed Saturn, it was beautiful to look at. The spheric wormhole was simply breathtaking. Although the scene was way too short, it was one of the best.The black hole and its center was also quite good.Visually, the film lacked imagination and scope in every other aspect. Most of the space scenes consisted of unexciting chamber shots inside the spacecraft. The beauty and wonder of the foreign planets wasn't explored at all. Besides a very cool tidal wave, the most exciting thing happening there was a stupid brawl between two astronauts on a rocky surface.There was also a risky docking maneuver in space that was thrilling, but depressing nonetheless. When a standard action beat such as a docking maneuver is the most exciting scene in a film about intergalactic space travel, you know the scriptwriter did something wrong.The scene where Cooper meets his daughter as an old woman was very touching and well executed. It reminded me of one of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes, ""The Long Morrow"".In my opinion, the film suffered from a weak screenplay and little imagination."
tt1345836,"Ultimately, this is an excellent film, but after seeing this as part of an all night trilogy viewing, I have to say it is not as good as The Dark Knight.The film opens with, strangely for Nolan a quite farcical scene that introduces Bane. I won't spoil it, but please tell me, who takes 3 unknown prisoners on a plane without even looking at their faces? Really??The proper story starts, and to chose words like jaded, withdrawn, cynical, tired, lethargic and disconnected, is how we find our hero and Police commissioner. So ultimately this is how the audience is manipulated into feeling too, and so act 1 is ultimately a long ""downer"" as lots of elements are put in place for the last 2 acts. But, after sitting through six hours of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, I was left feeling it was too much, and I started getting bored with the overall emotional shade of the film, coupled with the lack of action and the lack of any real story. It was like watching a plate spinner getting 40 plates spinning on pointy poles, necessary for his act, but ultimately boring for his audience.The second Act is where our bad guy makes his play and gains the upper hand. One of the strongest sources of praise for The Dark Knight, is the ultimately real-world story telling. But what Bane unleashes on Gotham, takes us back to the more comic book villainy of the first film, which I won't criticise, but for me is not as rewarding as the realism of the second film. All the while our good guys are slow, wrong footed, and creaking under their mental baggage, so we are two thirds through a superhero film, where our superhero has been anything but. Action has been thin on the ground, and we have all been through the ringer, and we are crying for some redeeming pay-off.After the third act, our her is restored, all has been put right. However, ultimately our pay-off for all we have been put through in the first two acts is only satisfying if you can shrug off the memory of what you have just been put through. It's much like childbirth, you need your brain to be swimming with endorphins to blank out the pain of labour, and for me, I didn't get enough endorphins to make the experience totally rewarding.Add to this, a slightly facial bad-guy twist, and a groan-worthy sequel shoe-in, I have to say that Nolan has tried to squeeze in far too much, and Batman's saga creeps over the line, rather than ending with a bang, so much so, you will feel convinced that this is not the final part of the story, and we will need another installment to accept that our hero has sailed off into the sunset."
tt0137523,"Fight Club is one of the greatest movies movies of all time... through the first 110 minutes. The film is about a man who has become a corporate slave, he sees no value or meaning in his life anymore. Because of this he goes to support groups in hopes that the pain of others will enable him to feel something, anything at all. The movie lays out a story that is entirely believable, considering people's tendencies of overworking, and the isolation many people feel in this modern world. Perhaps in the not-so-distant future people will feel the need to beat the hell out of each other to feel alive and connected. So far, in the film, you have grown attached to the characters and are immersed in the reality of what could be. The ending, ah the ending. The first 110 minutes of this movie are rated a 10/10 in my book, the last half hour or so brings the final rating down three points. The ending fit perfectly into a movie that was science fiction based. However this doesn't work. This movie bases its entire story around the idea that this kind of thing could really happen. The ending throws everything out the window. By the time this movie is over you might feel cheated, and rightfully so. To have science fiction like ending to this movie is almost as bad as making an entire movie a dream, you cannot do it! Salpping that ending onto this movie makes the entire thing feel pretentious and phony. Many will tell you that this is not the case, and that I just don't appreciate the twist at the end. To formulate your own opinion, well you will just have to watch this for yourself. Good luck and, please, give me some feedback."
tt0848228,"When i sat down to watch the Avengers i had little if not any hope that i would enjoy it. But i was wrong, what happened when the film started was a collection of events that changed my ""little hope"" attitude into something much different. After the opening scene i was, to say the least, entertained. But, when i tasked myself with the painfully easy job of rating this film, all this film is...is entertainment. In a time of dazzling CGI and insanely fun action sequences, The Avengers lives up to the hype. But in a world of intriguing plot, immersing performances and emotional roller coaster rides, The Avengers is nothing but another Transformers movie. Let me elaborate.Fans of the Marvel Comics will love this movie, because it does what it says on the tin, it effectively brings the heroes (not all of them, but some) together in a fist fight with a destructive foe. To a Marvel fan, this is gold. To a ""film"" fan, however, this movie is little more than a popcorn flick. People enjoying this movie is not my issue, i want people to enjoy movies, but when it comes to the rating systems on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes (etc) people have, wrongly, rated the Avengers near to the highest of all ratings. Films like the Godfather, ALIEN, Shane, Vertigo, Psycho, Blade Runner, Goodfellas, Jaws and many, many more films deserve the high rating because these are cinematic masterpieces. These are films which changed cinema, and have set the benchmark for all genres of today's films. But when i see The Avengers at the top of the ratings with them, it disgusts me. It should be rated fairly, on an accurate basis of how the film is crafted and the impact it makes, and for me it is a 4. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad movie. But, it is not a classic, nor by far a masterpiece, which renders most fans reviews redundant. People can love this movie, hell it can be there favorite movie of them all, but they need to understand it is nowhere near the Giants of cinema. Its not worth all the hype, but its fun. Its not a clever film (the themes have been done to death, and the twists are terrible) but its entertainment.So, i bid you farewell."
tt0114369,"I know there are many reasons to like or dislike any movie, and that most people who rate a movie 1 or 0 simply don't 'get it'. I feel a great sympathy for those who cannot find anything to praise in a film. Se7en is not an especially bad movie; it creates and maintains a particular atmosphere most of the way through; it is deliberately grungy, nasty, and brutal. The extreme lack of lighting serves a purpose - Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now seems bathed in floodlights by comparison - and the film achieves its ends efficiently enough.I am relatively OK with gore and violence (either on-screen or implied.) Many plots have holes, many movies get very clunky at the end, many actors share features with cardboard, and Se7en is no exception. If this film were in any way critical of the human capacity for the sheer unbridled brutality which it portrays, I might forgive it. If it had any redeeming qualities whatever, I like to think I would be prepared to try to acknowledge them, however grudgingly. Many dark movies manage to evince a knowing smile at some point, or succeed through technical brilliance or gripping acting.But I came out of this film wanting to throw myself under the nearest bus. It was as if everyone involved with the making of this film had spat (I think I spelled that correctly) in my seat. My experience of this film exactly matched that of another reviewer: it raped my soul. What worries me most is that there are quite so many positive reviews for this movie. I think this would have been one of H.P. Lovecraft's favourites, since the guiding hand behind it is most obviously that of Cthulu."
tt0629307,"Season 7 started off very, very well with ""Causa Mortis"". Not as brilliant as 'Criminal Intent' with ""Amends"", but a lot better than 'Special Victims Unit' with ""Demons"". The plot synopsis really does sound fascinating on paper and suitably complex (not a problem, 'Law and Order' often did complexity very well indeed) and Jamie Ross (only introduced in the previous episode and showed a lot of promise in it) to me was always one of McCoy's better partners.""I. D."" is as fascinating and as intricate as it sounds. It continues the high standard set by ""Causa Mortis"" and manages to build upon it and be an even better episode. Season 7 was solid on the whole, and ""I. D."" is one of the standouts when it comes to talking about Season 7's best episodes. As has been said, it is two stories in one structurally which faces the problem of being disjointed and the quality not being equal. Both problems are successfully avoided.Can't think of anything to fault ""I. D."" for. It is shot with the right amount of intimacy without being claustrophobic and that the editing has become increasingly tighter over-time has been great too. Nice use of locations too. The music doesn't get over-scored or overwrought, even in the more dramatic revelation moments. The direction doesn't try to do too much and is understated but never flat or unsure. The writing is intelligent and although, like the show in general, there is a lot of talk it doesn't feel long-winded. Marks' dialogue is as juicy as the juiciest of peaches, is witty and is very high up on the skin crawl factor.Both the investigating and legal subplots are brilliantly done and it doesn't feel to me too much like two stories in one, instead two different subplots that connect together. Although it's the legal story that is always mentioned whenever ""I. D."" is discussed for good reason, one shouldn't overlook the case. Which is an incredibly clever and intricate one, and that there is much more to the perpetrator than what it initially seems has the definite shock factor. The truth was so unexpected on my first watch, didn't even consider it as a possibility until it was revealed.The case does deserve to be discussed more but it is easy to overlook it with the legal/harrassment subplot being so juicy. Thanks to the unforgettable character of Marks, one of the most memorable judges in the franchise with a larger than life creepiness and contempt without unbalancing everything else. A favourite scene of mine from the episode is when McCoy introduces Schiff to his cellmates when in contempt. The ending is one of the stand up and cheer in complete satisfaction ones.Performances are excellent all round, with Jerry Adler standing out as Marks. He was very clearly enjoying himself without veering into pantomime. Pamela Grey brings out many dimensions to her role, one of those performances that brilliantly makes one feel at first sympathy for the character but revile her by the end.Overall, brilliant and a Season 7 standout. 10/10."
tt0993846,"Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is based on the autobiography of Jordan Belfort, who, using loopholes in the law, created a multimillion-dollar brokerage empire out of nothing, lived the 'American dream' and ended up in prison.""My name is Jordan Belfort. I'm a former member of the middle class raised by two accountants in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens. The year I turned 26, as the head of my own brokerage firm, I made $49 million, which really pissed me off because it was three shy of a million a week.""The film was flawlessly shot (nominations for best film and directing) and, although it lasts for three hours, it is not boring for a moment, and for the most part it is even very entertaining. Leonardo DiCaprio excelled in the lead role, but, as usual, remained only on the Oscar nomination. He is supported by Jonah Hill (also an Oscar nominee), Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, and many other not-so-famous, but no less good actors.If you are looking for a dramatic but humorous portrayal of life on a high but shaky leg, a newly rich man who lives fast in crazy sex, drugs, and more drugs manner, you are in the right place. To gain some idea of the explicitness and decadence in the film, it is interesting to note that DiCaprio once cited the Tinto Brass' ""Caligula"" (1979) as an inspiration and role model for making this movie.""Let me tell you something. There's no nobility in poverty. I have been a rich man and I have been a poor man. And I choose rich every time. Because, at least as a rich man, when I have to face my problems, I show up in the back of the limo, wearing a $2000 suit and a $40,000 gold watch.""But, although this story has some indication of social criticism and the potential for a deeper and more serious film, it still remains in the domain of a typical American blockbuster, without much substance and point.7,5/10."
tt0151349,"I am uncertain of how to appraise this modernized version of the classic fairy tale, ""Little Red Riding Hood"". The bits that are modernized -- grandma lives down the roads a piece in a nice Victorian house, not a cottage in the middle of the woods and Audrey takes the bus to get there -- are nicely thought out. Likewise, the gag sequences are nicely conceived and executed. However, I also think that animation should be about something that couldn't be done live, and none of the gags here were beyond the capabilities of the movie camera at this point.Still, finding a child star acting in short subjects at this point who could star in this.... well, that's a real issue. So I'll give this one the benefit of the doubt. Meanwhile, I wonder why Famous Studios dropped its ""Little Audrey"" theme in favor of the more generic ""Noveltoons"", intended for one shots...."
tt0133093,Was way ahead of its time. Still hold up. Now as far as the sequels I can not say the same thing.
tt0372784,"The action scenes in this movie looked absolutely horrible. There's no way to know what's happening most time... and I knew Batman would win before I entered the cinema, so if there's an action scene I want to see what happens! For a superhero movie this is a capital crime (can you imagine a superhero movie without any fight? This wouldn't suit the genre!) I also found quite annoying the scene with the Batmobile... man, it seems they want to sell you one! They tried to tell us how cool the Batbmobile was all time, and the scene turned out to be pathetic.The starting scenes became boring by the eleventh time Neeson talked about his pseudo-philosophical view on fear. A pity, since this could have been good if it was just a bit shorter.As for redeeming qualities, I was upset to notice there were none! Not the acting, which wasn't so bad (except for Holmes annoying character, though perhaps it was written like that), but didn't help to save the movie. The dialogs were also just OK, except when they tried to sell us their rants on vengeance/justice/fear and the like -they were such a bore...If you aren't a hardcore Batman fan, save your money. And if you are, perhaps you will notice more irritating matters which I couldn't spot, so..."
tt0102926,"It's the brightest jewel in the crown. The entire saga, including the subsequent novels, was made around and thanks to this dark and sinister film. Anthony Hopkins brilliantly portrays one of cinema's most iconic villains, unfurling his tentacles into the silhouette of the young innocent but cunning police trainee. In addition to Hopkins and Foster, excellent general direction decisions stand out, an adapted script that covers the best parameters of cinematographic suspense including unexpected turns and overwhelming silences. Photography and editing stand out equally.Unfortunately, it is not exempt from the Yankee imprint by including elements typical of North American cinema, involuntarily lowering the quality of the final product.Still, it's one of the best pieces of cinematography of its decade.Totally recommended, for people with a strong stomach."
tt0068646,"If only this film was not supposed to be the greatest movie ever made...Had an interesting start.
But then it took too long for me to get invested in the characters.
And it kind of tries to glorify crime and criminals.So yeah this movie needs lots of patience. Maybe when it was made it was different and trendsetter.Oh. The expectations."
tt0120815,"If you don't like typical American movies, playing cheaply with human emotions: go and spend your well earned money elsewhere.Or leave the theatre after the Rangers have captured the beachhead, because that is the only original input Steven Spielberg has made with his overrated Saving Private Ryan. Maybe your local theatre is showing an old WWII classic ?!"
tt0137523,"I'm not much into graphic violence. This film transcends that. It has wonderful direction, and, even though it is brutal, it takes things to another ledge. Edward Norton is really controlled as he realizes his power. It's too easy to throw in spoilers so I will leave things to the viewer. The search for self and the growing cult around Fight Club made me suspicious. Still, to watch what happens to the two men at the center and what they are without Fight Club is the core. One of the neat things about this film is seeing it a second town makes it even better. The mental byplay between Pitt and Norton increases tension to explosiveness. If you want to see what can happen to a story when put in masterful hands, read the book (which is outstanding), and see the movie. They show that art forms can treat the same material, each in their own ways."

But it's not stunning, it's unavoidably boring, as no particular details stand out, more like a fully industrialized product.There's a hint of propaganda about the American justice system in the middle.

tt1130884,"While there were some merits to ""Shutter Island,"" including the fascinating island setting, the film was labored in the first half, then turned on an intriguing plot twist. Still, there is the clear impression from this reviewer that an actor other than Leonardo DiCaprio would have discovered greater depth in interpreting the main role of Teddy Daniels.The time is 1954. The setting is Boston Harbor. The more precise locale is an institution for the criminally insane in an Alcatraz of the East Coast. An innate is on the loose on the island, necessitating the arrival of the marshal, Teddy Daniels, and his sidekick, Chuck Aule. Unfortunately, the film really drags for the first hour as Daniels and Aule explore the island and are sized up the medical staff, including the two principal doctors, Cawley and Naehring. Ben Kingsley and MaxVon Sydow are in top form with an undercurrent of menace in their treatment of the visiting cops.During his whirlwind experience on the island, Teddy appears to be prone to visions or flashbacks, based upon his World War II experience of having discovered the horrors of Dachau as an American GI who first entered the camp. He was also traumatized by the death of his wife in a fire. But the dialogue seemed strained and artificial when a girl appears to Teddy and says, ""Why didn't you save me?"" with Teddy's response a succinct, ""I got here too late."" Is Teddy recalling his experience at Dachau, or is it a more personal vision of a family member?In the essential structure of the film, the success depends in large part on the actor playing Teddy Daniels. DiCaprio often overacted the part. The role demanded many facets of the character's personality and nuanced responses to intense situations. Leo simply could not carry the film the way that was needed in the psychological dimensions of a complex character."

tt0468569,"Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Can't see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. It's a better film than this. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....This may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn't move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn't a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasn't been hyped that much, so where is this coming from?"
tt0068646,"This is over done and over rated. It sucks.It just doesn't make any sense why people like one crime film so much. There are so many good motion pictures out there, and out of all of them, people pick this one? Honestly Francis Ford Coppola is over rated, and he makes lots of trash films."

tt0816692,"Christopher Nolan once again gives more than enough evidence that he is the most overrated director in modern Hollywood. How is it possible to have such a premise (interstellar voyage to save human race) and make such a boring movie? It beats me, but what puzzles me even more is how it is possible to make a movie with almost no character at all. What is this movie about? It's not about an interstellar voyage, that's for sure. It ain't about discoveries, either. (imagine a group of explorers who are some of the first people to land on another planet and they are excited as my 90+ year-old grandmother is when she cooks dinner) It ain't about aliens either. It ain't about saving humanity either, there is hardly any people shown except for one village somewhere in USA. Can you really tell a story that big by wrapping it around just a few people? In theory you can and it could actually work if it made any sense. But to end the movie they it was done here, by placing a portal inside a black hole which is designed to connect only two specific people, two specific people who have accidentally found NASA's basement top-secret James Bond project - it is beyond me. Once Cooper started texting his daughter in Morse code through this portal I felt embarrassed. I felt embarrassed for Nolan brothers. That's it? That was the grand idea which connects the loose ends and saves humanity? I wish Matt Damon had killed them all, it would have been more interesting and much more plausible than this mess. His anger actually makes sense, who wouldn't be frustrated with a plot like this?I believe a big portion of estimated 165 million dollar budget went into paid reviews here on IMDb."
tt0137523,"Like so many other users I found this a worthwhile movie to watch for about the first third. The film deals out some hard blows against modern consumer society, that could be called daring for a high budget Hollywood production. The given thesis- relief and the chance to achieve self-discovery through violence, is inane though. As the story develops we see that the whole Fight Club thing leads the protagonists to become some sort of a terrorist organization, culminating in a series of attacks that obviously destroy a good part of the town in the end. Isn't that turning the whole point upside down, so that the message could be: Non conformity will inevitably lead to chaos and destruction, so please avoid any critical thoughts ? In a way I felt that in the end the script-writer attempts to apologizes for the hard strokes dispersed in the beginning.The most embarrassing thing about the movie of course is the displaying of Norton's schizophrenia. You can watch this movie as often as you want: This trick will never work and it will always be an insult to the intelligence of the viewer to realize that the makers really believe they can come up with such nonsense and earnestly hope to get away with it (which they actually did,of course. After all this half-baked botch ranks in the top 30 of all times. That's as incredible as Norton and Pit being the same person )."
tt1375666,"This is just an average big budget Hollywood movie.Don't expect any complexity or depth from it, it is simple and quite shallow.Technically it's well done, the plot is OK, the actors are fine, the FX are good and hopefully you will have a good time watching the characters running and jumping around, ducking bullets and explosions and so on while a VERY SIMPLE AND QUITE SHALLOW psychological-scifi plot unfolds.But you won't get much else from it.I'm giving it a 7. So folks, don't believe the hype about this thing being a fascinating and revolutionary piece of art, because IT'S NOT. It's just another Hollywood commodity out to make big bucks. If you want some enlightening psychology read ""?"" and don't watch this, for ***ck's sake.There are some really cool effects to this film, but the story is so convoluted that it detracts away from the story."

tt0480025,"The successful conclusion of the Falklands War in 1983 gave a boost to British patriotic feeling and helped re-elect the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. It was however, in the words of British director Shane Meadows ""an incredibly suspicious war, in the same way America and the UK got involved in Iraq"". During a time when 3.5 million were unemployed, Meadows bemoans the fact that British paratroopers were involved in killing 16-year old Argentine boys, fighting for a useless piece of land. Though victorious, the war in the Falklands unleashed underlying feelings of alienation and racism among some elements of British working class youth and gave rise to the Skinheads, a group that ultimately became involved in the public mind with the neo-Nazis.Loosely based on Meadows' teenage experiences, This is England dramatizes the unrest in Britain from the perspective of 12-year old Shaun (Thomas Turgoose), a diminutive working class youngster who lives with his mum after his father was killed in the war. Preceded by a montage of news and cultural events from the early 1980s, the film depicts Shaun's decline from joyous camaraderie with new found friends to support of an intolerant and emotionally disturbed role model. As the film opens, Shaun is a schoolboy with a cherubic look that conveys a sweet innocence. Just under the surface, however, there is a feistiness and volatility that provides pointers to where he is headed.Friendless and bullied, Shaun seeks a sense of belonging and soon becomes part of a gang of mischief makers and lay-a-bouts who give him the respect and dignity he is looking for. Led by Woody (Joseph Gilgun) and Milky (Andrew Shim), the group is proud of their working class status and dress accordingly with work-boots, jeans, and white shirts. Shaun allows one of the girls Lol (Vicky McClure) to shave his head and experiences his first kiss with Smell (Rosamund Hanson). Though his mother (Jo Hartley) is horrified when she sees how he looks, she is content to leave the boy in the care of his new friends. The most virulent racism in the film comes from Woody's friend Combo (Stephen Graham) who has just been released from prison and who splits the group into political and non-political factions. Joining the neo-fascist National Front, Combo and those that go with him unleash rhetoric of ferocious nationalism and set out on a campaign to intimidate immigrants and people of color. Meadows brilliantly shows how damaged lives and mutual needs can bring people together to take out their frustrations against those below them on the socio-economic scale.Torn between his friendship for Woody and his desire to redeem his father's memory, Shaun decides to join Combo's group, seemingly unaware that he is a powder keg ready to explode. Soon Shaun is spouting the racist clich√©s of his mentor as well as joining with him in assaults against Pakistani youngsters and local shopkeepers. Triggered by a discussion with Milky (Eric Shim), a Jamaican, about his own past, Combo's confrontation with the gentle black man is the dramatic high point of the film and the most difficult to watch. For Shaun it is a moment of realization and despair that signals the end of his childhood. For the viewer, it is a moment of searing pain and unbearable emotion.Winner of the award for Best Independent British film, This is England follows the tradition of directors Ken Loach and Mike Leigh by combining gritty realism with humor, punctuated by tension and outbursts of brutal violence. The performances are outstanding, especially those of Turgoose and Graham, who create fully three-dimensional characters that come alive as people we can identify with and relate to, while still deploring their actions. Using a soundtrack of ska (Caribbean rhythm and blues) melodies and the songs of Toots and the Maytals, This is England is a timely film that not only captures the mood of the 80s in the British Midlands with authenticity and rare honesty but has important parallels to events of the present day."
tt0111161,"I'm not going to tip toe around it, this film is crap. Its completely unoriginal, its not artistic, its not demanding (except for being boring).You will not learn anything about the world through this film.This film is not a part cinematic history, unlike nearly all other films in the top 250.It is predictable and emotional crap.But even if your not into cinema, and you just like popcorn entertainment there are far better movies out there...basically any on the video shelf."
tt0108052,"It's a great movie and i recommended it to anyone who wants to see a beautiful film about the great tragedies of the holocaust. This film's only ""bad thing"" is that it's in black and white but this believe it or not gives it even more beauty. I think that this movie is suitable for kids 12 and up if they are watching it with their parents. Also remember that is film is based on a true story. Schindler was a man who helped the Nazis in many ways (suplying weapons etc)but he did not think that what was being done to the Jews was right so he helped many of them who are still alive today and many who left their children to tell the story."
tt0167260,"I liked all of the Lord Of The Rings films, but this one has to have the best battle scenes in it though and the most stunning special effects in it. The acting was pretty good in the film, and Peter Jackson is a good director.As you may might have known the story carries on from The Two Towers. Frodo, Sam and Gollum are trying to get into Mordor and taking the ring into Mount Doom to destroy evil once and for all. While the others fight off the orcs and the other creatures to defend them.The only part of this film I didn't like, was the ending. It just dragged and dragged for ages. I know that's probably how it ends in the book but come on!. Did the ending have to be 25 minutes long?. It could have easily been shortened down to 10 minutes.Overall, I do think that this film is a very good action/adventure film but it could have got a better score if the ending was a lot shorter.I would give this film a rating of 8/10."
tt1130884,"Perhaps I should better begin this user comment by underlining that I'm primarily a horror fanatic and, moreover, that I have a specific exaltation for genre movies taking place on (A) remote inescapable islands and largely set in (B) mental asylums. I've seen numerous cheap horror movies, ranging from astounding to abominable, featuring one or both of these keywords and I personally think they are fundamental components to help determine the creepiness impact of a certain horror movie. ""Shutter Island"" features both these key ingredients as well, so normally this should have been one of my most anticipated movies ever, but instead I was quite skeptical ever since I first saw the trailer. First and foremost I'm annoyed again that everybody seems to avoid labeling this as a horror movie. Like it's still common to think horror is in an inferior genre that acclaimed directors and actors don't even lay their hands on. If you look on the main page on this website, ""Shutter Island"" is categorized as drama, mystery and thriller. I assure you, given the subject matter and the scenery featuring here, this is a horror film. It has everything to do with atmosphere and nothing with bloodshed or ax-wielding maniacs. Secondly, I tend to be very tolerant and easygoing on those aforementioned cheap horror movies because they're often low-budgeted and struggling movies from aspiring and hard- working directors. However, in the case of ""Shutter Island"", where the budget is practically unlimited and all the involved people are highly respected and critically acclaimed names, I feel I'm entitled to be extra demanding. I expect everything to be impeccably perfect, including the plot, the atmosphere, the set pieces, the acting performances, the directing, the continuity and the tension level.The greatest news to announce is that ""Shutter Island"" lives up to most of these expectations, especially when it comes to atmosphere and choice of locations. Right from the opening seconds already, you can tell this will become a thoroughly ominous and gripping film with a professional eye for detail. A ferryboat appears from a thick cloud of fog, there are clear signs of an approaching hurricane, there is recitation about an ""asylum for the criminally insane"" and the first long images of the titular island are brought under the guidance of excruciatingly sinister musical tones. The intensity of the opening sequence promptly grabs you by the throat and you want the two main characters ‚Äì Federal U.S. Marshals Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule ‚Äì to get away from the island as far as possible before they even set foot on it. ""Shutter Island"" first unfolds as a compelling mystery set in the paranoid and depressing post- WWII era of the early 1950's. The island is a controversial governmental place where the Doctors Crawley (Ben Kingsley) and Naehring (Max Von Sydow) are running a mental institute facility for ""normal"" male and female cases as well as incurably dangerous patients. The Marshals are called to the island to investigate the inexplicable disappearance of a female patient, but there's obviously a lot more brooding underneath the surface. The doctors and wardens deliberately boycott the Marshals' investigation and Teddy Daniels has a personal and much more critical agenda to fulfill. He's looking for the pyromaniac patient responsible for the death of his wife and he intends to expose the island as a place where the American government uses mental convalescents as subjects to experiment upon. Teddy also suffers from painful War traumas, like the sights of frozen cadavers in a German concentration camp, and he still has conversations with his deceased wife Dolores. When the hurricane vanquishes the island, Teddy and Chuck see an opportunity to sneak into the infamous C-Block, where they lock away the worst cases and presumably the experiments, but the revelations where Teddy stumbles upon as from that moment are certainly not what he expected or hoped to find out.""Shutter Island"" is the type of film that overwhelms and deeply impresses you with plot twists, subliminal themes, red herrings, convoluted conspiracy theories, character drawings growing increasingly complex and intriguing but ultimately irrelevant sub plots. The script feels like a solidly structured and tightly woven wholesome for as long as you're watching the film, but it's definitely worthwhile to analyze the movie afterwards. Unfortunately I can't elaborate too much without revealing some essential plot elements, but I urge you do it yourself. Once you leave the cinema or take the disc out of the DVD player, starting thinking back about the little things that were done or said throughout the entire film. Movies like this deserve to be discussed and analyzed rather than to just walk away with a feeling of overall astonishment. You'll notice that some minor details fit in perfectly with the denouements revealed at the end, whereas other story aspects will suddenly become illogical, senseless and implausible. And also, if you've seen a lot of grim, obscure and long-forgotten horror movies (the kind I talked about in the first paragraph), well than you honestly won't be surprised at what you see that often. You won't hear me claim that ""Shutter Island"" is unoriginal or predictable, but like so frequently the case, it does incorporate many little facets (whether just a certain noise, bizarre characteristic or tiny plot detail) that I spotted already in other movies. That really isn't a complaint; merely a footnote. I don't intend to say that ""Shutter Island"" ripped any other films, simply that horror fanatics are likely to be slightly less impressed than the more mainstream audience. My only main complaint is that I personally found ""Shutter Island too long. Admittedly I have a bit of an aversion towards long films, but I really felt that some of the sub plots and repetitive hallucination sequences could have been cut shorter. The filming locations, set- pieces and scenery are tremendous and particularly the re-creation of the 50's atmosphere is admirably accurate."
tt0848228,"I love the Avengers, in theory. Unfortunately, in practice I couldn't wait for this movie to end.From the empty backstory for the 'bad guys', to a total lack of empathy for any of the main characters, I found this whole experience soul crushingly dull. Which is odd when there's an explosion or a fist fight every 5 minutes.It would be quite annoying to work out the veneer-thin plot if not having seen some of the prior Marvel outings for Thor, Iron Man, et al, but there are some saving graces.An almost seamless set of special effects does lend a sense of realism to the ridiculous scenarios that the heroes find themselves in. And with plenty of running time to allow each a fair chunk of screen time, it doesn't feel as if any one member is worth less than the rest.That's part of the problem for me- with trying to squeeze an equal share for everyone in, it starts to feel patched together, losing coherence. When the flow begins to break up, my attention span begins to shorten. I start to not care about the events or their impact on the story, and instead just want to see the Hulk smash."
tt0848228,"With the high budget this film had, I should not be noticing the staging.""OK, Mark, you stand there and look annoyed but knowing, Scarlett, look like you're pondering, Chris, focus on keeping some of the accent but not all of it . . . ""There was no scene in the film where I didn't see with my mind's eye the director on set barking stage direction. Perhaps if the script had been stronger, I wouldn't have noticed. But pair a weak script with a long series of obviously staged (and very non-dynamic) scenes, and you end up with more flat scenes than I can count.Character development: With this cadre of fun and interesting actors and the huge budget that hired them, you'd think you'd end up with quality oozing out of the screen. No. Robert Downey's Stark was one- note, snarkie, and that's it. A few fun lines, but zero cleverness and no depth. The same with the rest of them. Except for Mark R. and Scarlet J. They were the only two who created anything interesting with their parts - and of these two, Mark R. created a genuinely interesting character in Banner.CGI: Big budgets mean you shouldn't notice the CGI. In one scene in particular, it was obvious that the actors were in front of a green screen, with the CGI added later. They should blend into the CGI not stand apart and obviously in front of it.Script: Could the script have been more plodding and obvious? It was not a smart or clever script. It read like . . . a comic book! Perhaps that's all Marvel can do well."
tt0108052,"It's not that Schindler's List is a bad movie; in parts, it's quite powerful.  What has always annoyed me about this film, however, was the way it was so unreservedly embraced by critics and unsophisticated moviegoers. Seriously, am I the only one who was unimpressed by the main ethical point of the movie? Really, what does this film have to say beyond, ""the Holocaust was a bad thing?""  I'm sorry if I don't consider this to be groundbreaking, cutting-edge historical analysis.  Furthermore, am I the only one who was offended that Spielberg made a fundamentally ""feel good"" movie about the holocaust?  Was I the only one that was offended by the fact the film ends by dedicating itself to the six million Jews who died in the Holocaust (and about the five million non-Jews who also died you say nothing)?  Did anyone else notice how the main characters in Schindler's List were not actually Jewish, thereby following in the grand Hollywood tradition of turning the story of oppressed people into the story of a sympathetic member of the oppressing group (a la Cry Freedom, Mississippi Burning, Beyond Rangoon, and so on)?  What really offended me, however, was an issue that, in all fairness, was peripheral to the film itself.  I was infuriated by the way Hollywood patted itself on the back for making a movie it hadn't wanted to make, a movie it should have made decades before.  Schindler's List was made about forty years too late, and at its core is the same innocuous Hollywood nonsense that has pervaded the world of cinema for far too long.  The memory of the members of my family who were murdered during this tragedy deserved better."
tt0110912,"The proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating. The proof of the movie is in the watching. Most of the top 250 IMDb movies have kept me glued to my seat--with this one I found my mind wandering to that jigsaw puzzle I hadn't finished or the possibility of some popcorn. I found I had very little interest in the characters or in what was going on.I asked myself why. Technically the film is very good. The actors all hit their marks and Samuel L. Jackson is particularly outstanding. I liked Maria de Madeiros also as Bruce Willis' wife Fabienne. The camera work is occasionally interesting, as the long scene where we watch Bruce Willis listen unemotionally to Marsellus go on. Interesting, certainly, but rather pointless.Indeed, that's the problem: so much of what goes on is pointless. It's a big long shaggy dog story, told by one of those irritating people who can't get the story straight and have to keep going back: ""Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. Well, you know what I was telling you before . . ."" I tried to find some justification for the higgledy-piggledy way in which this story is told. It does result in the best scene being the last one. But if this scene was the point then why not design the script so that the action is seen to be moving toward this goal and cut out everything that happens afterward? In the end I don't think Tarentino knew what story he was telling and that's why so much is so pointless.The scenes of Butch attempting to control his temper, of his dilemma whether to help Marsellus, and the final scene in the restaurant are all good and entertaining as far as they go but they don't fall into a coherent framework. And the rest is quite dull.The dialogue is not witty or clever although it occasionally has its moments. The constant profanity is as pointless as the rest; the point of profanity is presumably to emphasize what one is saying, but if everything is emphasized, nothing is. The mind becomes numbed by it. It's like someone who shouts all the time. Eventually you stop listening. The quotes give you a pretty good idea of what the dialogue is like: when ""Shut the f*ck up, fat man!"" is listed as a memorable quote, you know how inane the conversation is.That this poorly composed script should have won an Oscar is a pretty clear indictment of the Academy."
tt0554361,"Anglo-Indian Amos McAleer (John Russell) visits the Shawnee (cue the villain theme!) as an Onodaga emissary urging war on the Crown's behalf against the Boonesborough settlers; then in long-hunter persona he urges the Boonesborough townsfolk to concede the frontier and decamp to the east. In another dubious mission, Dan agrees to visit the tribes in his company.Back to action-adventure after the previous bottle episode, and its a pleasure to have deep-voiced Westerns stalwart Russell along on the trail. He went the distance from 1950's B Westerns to Clint Eastwood's vehicles of the 1970's and 80's. Adding additional Boonesborough layers to the story are 1960's TV journeyman Kevin Hagen (three guest appearances on DB and later Dr. Baker on ""Little House on the Prairie"") as McAleer's half brother and Patricia Huston as his brotherly-contested spouse. Yadkin gets to take on some leadership role in Daniel's absence. Onboard for a comic coda as a tribesman is John Ford stock company player Hank Worden (""The Searchers"").Some historical background this hour which requires deconstruction:* McAleer is clearly operating from the start as a British agent, no spoiler there. He is alluded to, authentically, as being in the pay of Lt. Col. Henry Hamilton, Governor of Detroit and primary British commander in the Ohio country during the war from 1775-on.* No real explanation here for why the Shawnee are listening to the Onodaga, who are based far to the east with the Iroquois Six Nations along Lake Ontario, and had more than enough local problems to keep them occupied during the Revolution.* Dating of the episode is kept vague; no active reference to the Revolutionary War in the east, but ""General Washington"" is alluded to. Again, the real Boonesborough started concurrent with the war's outbreak in the spring of 1775, so no run-up to the Revolution there.* Revolutionary and War of 1812 storylines are comingled when reference is made to a ""Shawnee Prophet."" There was one - he was Tenskwatawa, brother of Shawnee chief Tecumseh, a religious leader who provided the spiritual component to Tecumseh's efforts to build an American -resistant Midwest-Mid-South Indian Confederacy. He somewhat lost face after his settlement, Prophetstown, was attacked and destroyed by US General William Henry Harrison during the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe.Though elements ate borrowed liberally from earlier episodes ""The Sound of Wings"" and ""The Hostages,"" we get a fairly full helping of frontier history, politics, and action this hour. Another early win for DB, Season 1."
tt0068646,"I saw this movie years ago, and I loved it. It was my favourite movie. This morning, I watched it again, and began to pick it apart.This movie is first and foremost overlong. Unnecessary dialogue and scenes weaken the raw effect that could have been produced. The musical sequence after Pacino does his restauant thing is unlike any other in the movie, it doesn't fit in. The part of the movie detailing Pacino's stay in Italy is poorly done, and also doesn't fit in.Some of the performances are dull, such as Keaton's, Lettieri, and Conti. Yes, I do believe Brando's part is badly written. I know I will be hated for saying this, but the character constantly changes, and his dialogue is never consistent. Brando does his best, and I don't think anyone could have done better, but it was still not a great part. The only outstanding performances were those of Caan and Pacino. Caan's acting is raw and Pacino is right on target.Besides the main theme, music is weak and unfitting. As I have said, some of the scenes don't fit, and the music score doesn't help any. At one moment, the movie is a gritty masterpiece, and  at another a cheesy, cliched piece of film, going back to the traditional style of film, ruining the film's effect. Had the movie cut all the silly dialogue, not to mention the sans-dialogue scenes that aren't even poetic, which a dialogueless scene should be, the effect might  be better.Also, to throw some more mud, the romance between Keaton and Pacino is awful, and no chemistry is arisen.A disappointment, but not to be missed. I recommend a single viewing. One more thing, this film certainly doesn't deserve to be the best ever, it shouldn't even be in the top one hundred, but it doesn't deserve a ""1"" rating, I only give it that because I want the average rating to go down."
tt0480025,"The mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the 80's well with some good performances.However.....The script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where I expect it was intended to be edgy. The characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clich√©s that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front. The biggest problem is this movie has no real story. It ticks all the right ""arty"" boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point was.Very disappointing"
tt0110912,"Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories that entertwine together around the world of Marcellus Wallace. Quentin Tarantino proves that he is the master of witty dialogue and a fast plot that doesn't allow the viewer a moment of boredom or rest. From the story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a date between a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss. There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected. The movie redefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John Travolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fan of film."
tt0468569,"I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst."
tt0816692,"I really liked the idea and the plot full of unexpected points and developments. Especially the second half of the movie is really intense of emotions and the final is simply great. I don't give 9 stars because in my opinion the dialogues are not brilliant, like in other Nolan's movies."
tt0430833,"Who ever wrote the last comments about Kieth Olbermann, obviously doesn't know what he is writing about.Olbermann is intelligent, fair minded, and straightens out those ignorant saps that watch Fox. It's about time that another side of the news is presented. His programs are well thought out, and done with class, unlike his counterparts on other news channels. His factual analysis of other so called ""news cable news"" stands to his credit. MSNBC has great and fair talent. Olbermann's guests are not ""staged"" to back up one story or another. It's time we had real ""fair and honest"" news people on the air."
tt0167261,"The second installment in Peter Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien'strilogy loses none of the epic feel or the original, and adds aconsiderable amount of action/adventure to fill out the bill.One can admire the first-rate special effects and certain aspects ofthe visual design. A new character, one of the most realisticanimatronic creatures yet conceived, almost steals the show. Buteven in spite of all this, The Two Towers comes off as a bitbloated, repetitive, and even occasionally dull..The characters aren't particularly interesting. Ian McKellan as theWhite Wizard is again the standout performance; most everyoneelse lacks star quality. In particular, Liv Tyler speaks as if she's ina trance. Ironically, the most fascinating characters here arecomputer-generated: the talking trees, and a misshapen creaturewho once owned the Ring.Most of the film is painted in broad strokes, at once giving it amythic sense while making it feel too simple. The characters moveback and forth between being captured and released with very littleemotional payoff. The occasional humor boils down to charactersfalling falling on their faces.Worst of all, the film's dialog is completely generic, devoid ofcrackle and originality. No Oscar nominations for script this year.I was sitting next to some Ring fans on opening day. As theclosing theme came up and people began to leave, one of themsaid, ""Gee. That was a disappointment."" His pal nodded."

Although I'm a sucker for well-crafted appeals to universal heartstrings, I was mildly repulsed by Hanks' Gump and his dim-yet-supposed-to-be sage insights on the major events of modern American life.  Technically, FG has the right stuff, but the overall effect is all wrong.  Gump should be likable, but he just comes off as either clueless or a hollow witness of events.  I'll leave this sorry box of chocolates for someone else, thanks."

tt1853728,"In 1858, in Texas, the former German dentist Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) meets the slave Django (Jamie Foxx) in a lonely road while being transported by the slavers Speck Brothers. He asks if Django knows the Brittle Brothers and with the affirmative, he buys Django for him. Then Dr. Schultz tells that he is a bounty hunter chasing John, Ellis and Roger Brittle and proposes a deal to Django: if he helps him, he would give his freedom, a horse and US$ 75.00 for him. Django accepts the deal and Dr. Schultz trains him to be his deputy. They kill the brothers in Daughtray and Django tells that he would use the money to buy the freedom of his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who is a slave that speaks German. Dr. Schultz proposes another deal to Django: if he teams- up with him during the winter, he would give one-third of the rewards and help him to rescue Broomhilda. Django accepts his new deal and they become friends.After the winter, Dr. Schultz goes to Gatlinburgh and learns that Broomhilda was sold to the ruthless Calvin Candie von Shaft (Leonardo DiCaprio), who lives in the Candyland Farm, in Mississippi. Dr. Schultz plots a scheme with Django to lure Calvin and rescue Broomhilda from him. But his cruel minion Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) is not easily fooled.""Django Unchained"" is a highly entertaining and funny movie by Quentin Tarantino. The story is a parody of the Italian spaghetti genre and works very well since the story is good and the cast is outstanding. Christoph Waltz ""steals"" the movie and the joke with Franco Nero is unforgettable. But I would never dare to say that ""Django Unchained"" is a kind of movie to be nominated to the Oscar but forgetting this absurd, it is a great movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Django Livre"" (""Django Free"")"
tt1345836,"In order that this review doesn't sound like it came from the Department of Redundancy Department, I will try not to cover the same ground as my predecessors in declaring that the Emperor has no clothes. Rather, I will try and discuss the little things that made this a big, bad film.Let me also say I am not a worshipper of Mr. Nolan, nor am I a staunch detractor of his. The Prestige is one of the best and most original films I have ever seen. I enjoyed Memento, and also Batman Begins.I was not a fan of Inception, and my feelings on The Dark Knight are mixed. I very much enjoyed Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, and the way the Joker's character was written. I thought the Joker's monologue in the hospital when he explained to Harvey Dent that the hokey pokey IS what it's all about was nothing short of brilliant.I did not come to The Dark Knight Rises ready to hate it, or love it. I watched the film, objectively, and I saw it a second time from a better seat in a different theater, just to make sure I wasn't being unfair.Nope.Sorry Mr. Nolan, sir.Your movie sucks.Why? Because, as the Joker might remind us, the Devil is in the details.Details, details, details, it is the little things that the mind notices. Some of us laugh and call ""BS"" when John Wayne gets eleven shots out of a six-shooter, but we believe it when Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis never have to reload, because they swear and they have dirt and blood on their costumes and faces.For example, the matter of Bruce Wayne's fingerprints.Mr. Wayne is not only Batman, he is also a billionaire businessman. Surely, he would be a bit more, oh, perturbed that his fingerprints have been stolen. Let's be serious. If you found out that your fingerprints, or something else intimately connected to you, like your SSN or your signature had been stolen, wouldn't you be thinking about the possibility of identity theft? Wouldn't you be in a cold sweat that someone was going to use those fingerprints to perform a total cashectomy on you? Well, Bruce Wayne isn't. He's pretty cavalier about the whole thing. Ah, well, so somebody wants to steal my identity. Or my money. It's not like I'm a billionaire or I have a secret identity or anything.Wait.ALFRED! Ah, yes, but Alfred's not coming, Master Bruce. You see, he's so worried about you being completely unhinged, and unready to get back in the Bat-tights, and the possibility that you might be killed that he's just going to take it on his toes and leave you to your own devices when you're at your weakest point and you need him the most.Hurm.And then we have the matter of Miranda/Talia. Here I am thinking Tony Stark's the superhero who'll screw just about any interesting chick who's willing and available, but, well, Bruce has been having a bad month, we'll cut him some slack.Except Tony has staff members who do background checks on his playmates, and staff who dismiss them when he's through playing.With a few bucks and a non-disclosure statement, most likely.You would think that before Bruce Wayne wagered HALF his assets on a business partnership with Miranda, he would have used his state-of-the-art, info-the-KGB-CIA-MI5-doesn't have supercomputer to do a thorough background check.He is the goddamn Batman, after all.Well, he didn't. Not did he do any research on her before they got involved, kind of out of the clear blue sky.But he didn't find her sudden romantic interest fishy, and hey, she seemed like a nice girl, why not pass up Alfred, or Lucius Fox and just let her have the whole shebang.And then, after we discover How Bruce Got His Groove Back, he decides to buy some pastel shirts and abscond to the continent, leaving Gotham, and the Batman legacy in the hands of some cop named Robin (groan) with another very nice girl who has shown him that she's a liar and a thief who probably doesn't have his best interests at heart.Here's to you, Alfred. Sorry you're broke. Good luck with all those orphans and none of my money, relying on the city to keep you funded.Burn the furniture in the rooms you're not using for heat if they cut you off for a few years. Get the boys some paper routes.Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go return some videotapes.Hurm, I say again, because this person doesn't sound like any Bruce Wayne I've ever encountered, in any of his many incarnations.I mean, Adam West was a lot more on the ball in the old TV show. And if this is Bruce Wayne as an, ahem, realistic character? Realistically, this self-pitying, egocentric, blundering half-wit wouldn't have ever made it out of that Asian prison in the first movie.Riddle me this? When is Bruce Wayne not Batman? In this film. Because there is no Devil in these details, indeed, if you are looking for The Dark Knight in Bruce Wayne as portrayed in this film, there is no-one there at all."
tt0397103,"Smile isn't a film that's likely to please many action movie watchers. Some may not have the patience needed to understand its fine intentions. It's actually a film with much to say - being essentially an introduction to the World Wide Doctors Gift fund. The beginning of the movie sets the scene perfectly - a kindly shanghai worker, perfectly played by Luoyong Wang ('Bruce Lee Story'93) finds an abandoned new born baby girl and takes her home to selflessly give the child a better chance for a decent life. This causes friction between his wife an son.On the same day in California USA another baby girl is born into the family of a Doctor and his wife. The parallel story that unfolds in the US tends to wander into story details that detract from the main theme - slowing the movie unnecessarily. Katie, the California girl who's very well played by Mika Boorem, has all she could want materialistically but she's not generally given to care for anyone other than herself. Enter one of her school teachers Mr Matthews, played by the interesting Sean Astin ('Lord Of The Rings' 1-2-3.). During the last school year Mr Mathews was involved in taking students to China to voluntarily participate in the medical charity group 'Operation Smile'. He's now attempting to recruit a new group to return this year. This eventually brings the two same-day-born girls together. Unfortunately, first time feature writer/director Jeffrey Krammer tends to gloss over some of the more important details - while other padded situations seem to receive a little more attention than they deserve. The movie would have played better being at least 20min shorter.A recipient of the prestigious American Cinematographers Award: Director of photography, Edward Pei (Panther '95) gives the film a truly striking visual treatment. For one reason or another the movie tends to offer far more believable performances during the Chinese sequences than the states. An interesting sequence has the Chinese 'dad' and adopted daughter out watching a Roy Rogers film projected at an outdoor mall! complete with loving shots of the 35mm (no less) projectors. What makes this unusual is that a scene like this takes a good deal of setting up, especially in the days of video projection. Seems Dale and Roy Rogers set up a grant/fund to keep family entertainment alive - hats off to them both!The wives don't shape-up all that well in this story, with Katie's mum the lovely Linda Hamilton (Dante's Peak '97) seeming to fly off the handle too easily and Danial's wife played by Jia Song showing no feelings for the little deformed orphan. While 'Smile' may have flaws, the only story to seriously consider is the 'Operation Smile' program's ability to bring people of other lands together in care, also offering the all important potential for personal growth. An understanding of one of life's most vital aspects--the ability to care for others as you would have them care for you-- Those looking for an examination of life-changing situations could enjoy this most."
tt0137523,"I first saw Fight Club when I was 8 years old. I didn't understand any of it, but I liked the fighting and editing.I saw it again when I was 13 and just started seeing movies for what they were - a language. A language through which the filmmakers interpret their own views on the world. I understood more of it, especially being part of ""the middle children of history"" generation.After that, I saw it at least once per year and every single time, I realized something new or different about it, and the world itself. I grew with this movie both intellectually and spiritually.Still took me another 12 years to understand this movie is THE textbook for Jungian psychology BESIDES already being the single greatest social critique of the consumer era.It's ridiculously smart, deep, beautiful and cool. I've watched basically every movie out there, and nothing comes even close to the degree of greatness of Fight Club."
tt0167260,"Obviously this was a faithless and pointless butchering of the novel, but what's worse, a terrible movie.  Lacking flow, sense, linearity and dramatic impact, this played out like a highlights reel, not a coherent story.  The actors did an admirable job with the awful dialogue and nosensical personalities they were given, with some exceptions.  Peter Jackson's only two abilities seem to lie in super close up and super wide out shots, both of which are heartily abused.  And the special effects, for the most part, would have been better served by a cardboard set and some directing ability. There were high points, but this was and is the first and only movie I have ever left before the end and they barely kept me there but for the Eowyn-Nazgul scene.  A hollywood blockbuster?  No Doubt.  A good movie? Hell no.  Possessing anything in common with the literature it is supposedly based on?  The fact is, if this were based on real events, I don't think the people involved would have given them to right to use their real names. Maybe that wouldn't be such a big deal if I didn't have to hear about Jackson's love of the books, or read reviews that discuss staying true to the source material.  There is hardly a scene or underlying theme in the movie that has anything to do with the books.  This movie could probably have been worse, but I would be hard pressed to know how..."
tt0102926,"Watching The Silence Of The Lambs again some 30 years later, you come to realize it's greatest strength being, is that it is an 'actors piece'. This is what raises the picture up to it's still seminal and legendary status today, whilst the background story, events and supporting cast can seem slightly dated and diluted, due to the sheer number and diabolical content offered by thrillers since its inception.Both lead performers have weathered and survived the years immaculately however and is primarily the root source of why this film still holds up as strongly as it does.Both are exquisite in their creation and to watch.The haunted house finale is a bit wobbly and unreasonable even back in 1990 but probably not enough reason to carp.I don't think, in regards it's honouring, the Academy sweeps the thriller/horror genre under the rug in so far as accolade, more like a case being that films of undeniable excellence such as The Exorcist and this one are just so few and far between."
tt0109830,"Everybody talks about how great this movie is.  Will someone tell me why? So a stupid guy wanders through the world, saying all kinds of stupid stuff, chasing a drug addicted stripper, and by blind luck wanders into millions of dollars?  Yeah, I can see why that's so popular.  It seems like this movie would make more sense as an inspirational video for retarded people.Look!  You too can be a success without the unbearable burdens of intelligence or talent.  All it takes is ridiculous levels of luck.And what about the years of running?  Years of running?  What is that? It's just so ridiculous.  Who does that?  Who?  And people follow him?  ""I don't feel like running anymore.""  You're joking.  Who wrote this because they should really be crucified."
tt0468569,"When I saw Nolan's ""Batman begins"" I thought it was poorly directed - Not because Nolan is a bad director, but because this style of directing does not fit a comic. You can't take a movie about a guy in a bat suit too seriously and dismiss all comic aspects. Tim Berton knew this, directed accordingly (although this is also his usual style) and the result was a good movie. Nolan ignored this fact. The result was a movie that was not realistic at all, and yet tried to seem serious - an unintentional parody. The ""eastern wisdom and training"" montage clich√©s didn't help either.With ""The Dark Knight"", Nolan keeps making the same mistake, only this time its much worse. If the film is supposed to be realistic, you can't have so many unrealistic assumptions. One example: How is it the the Joker can get anywhere and do anything he want? He plants powerful radio activated bombs everywhere (it takes a whole company just to design these), He infiltrates the world's most powerful crime organizations etc. He keeps talking about how people start behaving like animals once you start disrupting their ordered world. But a plan of the Joker's magnitude would in real life require a huge, organized and coordinated group. Actually, in order to create ""anarchy"" in real life, you would have to organize and create a new form of order, so the Joker's point is moot.And that is just one of many contradictions I feel this movie has. That's OK for a movie that doesn't seem to take itself too seriously (like Berton's), but not for this one that seemingly aspires to be 'realistic' and to be taken seriously.The reason to give 2 stars instead of one: Superb acting by Heath Ledger."
tt7286456,"I'll be frank, I do not care about Batman at all. My entire friend group is into it so I keep up to date with them. But me not caring about Batman is why this is a good movie to me.It is an entertaining biopic of a legendary villain that presents good storytelling and a killer performance by Joaquin Phoenix. I would rewatch it willingly and will watch them going forward.For me, the only things I disliked about it are the aspects that make it too ""comic booky"" as I've taken to calling it. I enjoy lore. Alot. A bit too much by my own admission. What annoys me about comic based media is the general refusal to establish any lore. This more than most offers a ton of definitive reasons for Arthur's spiral into the Joker then rips it away. I understand why they do this for the sake of the comic heritage but its for that reason I physically cannot like this movie any more than a passing ""that was good"" before I forget about it a week later.I recommend it and I am sure that both comic fans and people like myself will thoroughly enjoy it. I am just in a weird situation where this genre was not meant for me and I have to accept that."
tt1375666,"Inception Nolans latest effort is a cleverly constructed and beautifully executed sci-fi thriller, apparently he first pitched the idea to WB in 2003 and then went away to write a script he thought would be finished in a few months, 8 years later the film is released and it's no wonder it took so long to complete.The film follows Cobb (Leonadro Di Caprio), who specialises in entering people's dreams and stealing valuable secrets his employers. We open with Cobb in the mind of Saito(Ken Watanabe); a business tycoon he needs to retrieve secret documents from, but things go horribly wrong when the subconscious projection of his former wife enters the dream and betrays him. Cobb and his partner Arthur (Joseph-Gordon Levitt) are forced to flee the country as their employers will not tolerate failure, but Saito tracks them down and makes them an offer; Inception. If they can successfully plant an idea into the mind of one of Saitos competitors Saito will pull the strings necessary to grant Cobb the freedom to go back to America and see his kids again.Cobbs team is consists of Arthur, Yusuf the chemist (Dileep Rao), Eames (Tom Hardy), Adriadne the architect (Ellen Page) who is responsible for creating the dream. Nolan not only manages to create a wonderful story, but also adds his own cyberpunk dialogue to the mix. 'Riding the kick', 'Totems', 'Projections', they all add substance to the world he has created. The origins of this technology are not explored, in fact it's more of an alternate reality than a story set in the future, but it's a world constructed with such attention to detail that it feels real.What follows is a complex but not overly contrived series of dreams within dreams in order to plant the idea deep enough for it to stick. It's a mixture of theft and business espionage that provides a setting for some wonderful visuals, and in the end the only limitation is the mind of Nolan himself. One scene where Arthur is fighting off the projections of the target inside a rotating corridor is thrilling to watch in all its nauseating vertigo, whilst Cobbs training of Adriadne provide the artistic license to pull a whole host of crazy special effects. Cities bend in half, mirrors smash and turn into streets, it's a world of unlimited potential.Di Caprio once again proves that he knows how to pick a movie, his Scorsese partnership rarely disappoints, but Nolan has provided the platform for another successful performance. Joseph-Gordon Levitt is able to play his role with both suave coolness and perfectly timed comedic relief, whilst Ellen Page uses her indie image to convey a female lead devoid of the usual stereotypes. The rest of the supporting cast all do a fine job, especially Cillian Murphy as the mind-invaded and emotionally manipulated target of the Inception.After watching this film I'm still convinced Nolan boasts a flawless oeuvre, every one demonstrates a clear talent for script-writing. Insomnia may be the weakest of them all and it will come as no surprise it's the only film he had no hand in writing in. Nolan however could not resist one final teaser to the audience with Inception. As the film concludes and we are left satisfied with the arc of our protagonist, the camera pans away on to the perpetually spinning totem. As it is about to topple the film cuts away, now I don't think Nolan is seriously trying to imply that Cobb is dreaming, instead I think it's his own clever Inception. To plant an idea into the minds of the audience and watch it grow."
tt1853728,"I was looking forward to a great western including what I presumed would be a deservedly negative portrayal of slavery. There was a clue right in the beginning of the sickness that would come to dominate the film, but it takes a while to realize where you are being taken. So the clue: Advice from our hero to some freed slaves that they should murder their subdued captors, said with a smile.The movie continues with a sense of joy and happiness in sadistically killing people. Two bounty hunters head off initially killing wanted men (criminals), but then it branches off into killing white southerners. When Django (one of the bounty hunters) is asked what he thinks of their task, he responds ""killing white people and getting paid too, what's not to like."" In the same way, perhaps early Nazis got a piece of paper from a superior authorizing them to round up men, women, and children, and have a great time killing them, this movie develops that strange sense of moral ""okay"" because it is written on a piece of paper. So, for example, because a warrant says dead or alive, the bounty hunters take this to mean that having-a-blast killing has now been authorized. So, instead of easily arresting a criminal, you shoot them, put them in pain, and then before a crowd, and with a smile, kill them dead.In another great scene, as the movie slips further into its killing spree, a wanted man is plowing a field with the help of his son. So from a distance, they shoot him and listen to the horrified son say, ""Oh, dad."" You would think that this is somehow setting up for making a deep statement about slavery. Well, no. Our bounty hunters (one white, one former slave) eventually decide to rescue the former slave's wife. Why not just go get the wife? It seems they want a properly documented sale. Back to this notion that be it a warrant or a bill of sale, these pieces of paper are all controlling. An interesting point, but it gets lost in all the joyous killing.One last example: Django asks a couple of female slaves to say goodbye to a southern bell, and then shoots her (along with all the other whites). I guess he was worried she might curse at him---how can Django been seen as anything other than a murdered? I had hoped for some sense of morality, of review of slavery, of a fantasy of righting some wrongs. However, the movie just wants to have fun murdering and with different reasons, setting up people to be casually executed.It is worth noting that it was Abraham Lincoln, having witnessing the horror of all the killing, wished to purge slavery and heal the nation. The north did not send out squads to murder the southern white population in joyous revenge.I object to presenting a movie that carries with it the message that given some basis of moral authority, you are then free to enjoy and needlessly murder to your heart's content."
tt0102926,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991), before I get into my review, I just want to say something right off the bat. Over the years, I've heard many people obsess over this ""movie"". Normally, I'm not the biggest fan of the horror genre. But, as soon as I found out that this is more of a crime/thriller, I thought: ""all right, I do enjoy crime and thriller movies, I'll give it a shot."" I watched it, and I just got nothing but pure disappointment with it. This ""movie"" has a cliched and somewhat predictable storyline, standard to mediocre acting, and a generic soundtrack. The plot is, an FBI agent named Clarice Starling, played by Jodie Foster, is after a cannibalistic serial killer named Hannibal Lecter, played by Anthony Hopkins. One thing I always say is, if a movie doesn't spark my interest within the first ten minutes then it isn't worth watching. But, with this ""film"", I was hooked within the first few minutes. As I watched the first ten minutes, I thought: ""okay, so far so good. Let's see if it can maintain this excitement for the rest of the movie!"" Unfortunately, after the first ten to fifteen minutes, it all goes downhill rapidly. After the opening scene, it just turns into your typical pedestrian crime/thriller film. I will admit, there were a few decent moments here and there. But overall, it was just a disappointment for me. To be honest, the only reason I watched this ""movie"" in the first place was because Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins were playing the main characters. Both of them are phenomenal actors! I'll be going into more details about them and the rest of the cast in just a moment. The weird thing is, the title mentions lambs, but there are no lambs anywhere in this ""film""! But, the lambs in this case are the victims of Hannibal Lecter. As he skins his victims when he kills them, kind of like shearing a lamb or sheep. If you can't overlook the title, I'd completely understand. I'm not the biggest fan of the title, I think they could've come up with a better one! Another joke is, this ""movie"" is also considered part horror film. It didn't scare me in the slightest, yet somehow it's marketed as a major hit in the horror genre. Like I said, I'm not a big fan of horror films. Most of them are cliched or predictable and this ""movie"" is no different. As for the acting, it's just standard to mediocre. The only two that appear to be trying are Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. To tell you the truth, I think that Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are the two biggest elements that keep this ""film"" from being ignored. Jodie Foster did the best she could despite the poorly written script and so did Anthony Hopkins. Another annoying problem is, I was looking forward to seeing Anthony Hopkins as a villain, but he has, maybe, about 20 minutes of total screen time. Yeah, that kind of sucked, because most of the time he can save any movie he's involved in, good or bad! I guess you could argue that they were going for the less is more trope. But, that doesn't work in this case. The rest of the acting is just hit and miss, you know that's bad when great actors like Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins can't save it! As for the soundtrack, it's just your everyday generic thriller film score. It does have some redeeming parts, but it's really just nothing to write home about. Now, let's get to the only good elements in this ""movie"". The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""movie"" a decent atmosphere. All of the special effects are well-done and they still hold up today. However, the reality is, great sets/locations and special effects are no excuses for a poorly written script. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is such an upset in the aspect of crime and thriller films. The worst thing is, it did have great potential. Unfortunately, little to no potential was achieved and it's nothing short of your cliched investigation movies. Maybe the original novel written by Thomas Harris is better? I don't know, I'll have to look into it some day. But, if this ""movie"" is any indication regarding the book, then maybe I should just leave it alone. I'm giving this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Unless you're a huge fan of horror films, I recommend skipping this film. You'll just end up getting skinned with a major letdown!"
tt0993846,"The Wolf of Wall Street is a film that depicts the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort who, through greed and corruption, established and led his own brokerage firm to success in the early 1990's. After losing his job at an established financial firm on Black Monday, Belfort fills a position dealing penny stocks in Long Island and subsequently partners with his new friend, Donnie Azoff, to found Stratton Oakmont. Belfort's aggressiveness in the market earned him the nickname, Wolf of Wall Street. Jordan and his team lived high-profile lifestyle full of parties, sex, and drugs (primarily cocaine and Quaaludes). Eventually Stratton Oakmont becomes a very well known firm and facilitates the IPO for Steve Madden, which instantly earned Jordan $20million dollars. Jordan decides to hide his money in an offshore account in Switzerland under his aunt-in-laws name. The FBI begins heavy investigations into Stratton Oakmont, and after ducking and dodging them for a couple years eventually one of his associates gets arrested, spills the beans about the operation, and Jordan is sentenced to prison for 36 months.I was thoroughly entertained by the film, and found most of the humor in good taste. The comedic aspect of the film is in my opinion is strongest suit. I would have liked to see more character development, and less predictable debauchery considering it was a three-hour film. Although some of the scenes felt repetitive. Leonardo DiCaprio and cast did a great job of building anticipation and suspense. I enjoyed the use of long cuts in certain scenes of the film such as the scene where Jordan Belfort punches his wife in the belly and attempts to take their child from their home ultimately crashing the car in front of their property. There were many memorable moments in the film, and I took from it interesting quotes such as, ""The only thing standing between you and your girl is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it,"" which Belfort said during one of his speeches.I believe a different approach to the film would've been to include characters that were negatively affected by Jordan Belfort's exploits. Without showing the effect Belfort's schemes had on his clients the film seems to glorify scamming people out of their money. There were many scenes in which Belfort's clients invest a serious portion of their savings with him only to be conned and lose it all. It would've been interesting for me if within the three hour time slot they included a few scenes depicting this tragedy."
tt0167260,"As someone who read The Lord of the Rings 15 years back and has been re-reading it ever since, the movie just takes too many liberties with the plot. The scriptwriters have introduced many twists that destroy the story and I'm sure Tolkien would have been horrified if he ever saw this. All in all, a good action movie but really ruined by some very lousy scriptwriting.Plot deviations include: The entire return to the shire is omitted so as to show the movie concluding with the defeat of Sauron, which just removes probably the most tragic part of the book. Frodo, manipulated by Gollum, asks Sam to leave him and go home in the climb to Shelob's lair. Faramir decides to take Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath(out of nowhere!! where did the scriptwriters dream this up from?) and many others too numerous to mention such as Tom Bombadil's scenes being assigned to Treebeard (???)AWFUL!"
tt1853728,"A German bounty hunter flees a Slave, Django, and the pair embark on a mission to find Django's wife.As soon as I heard Luis Bacalov's Django, I was hooked.This remains my favourite Tarantino film, and let's be fair there are many classics in that particular catalogue.Django is equal parts shocking, entertaining, dramatic, bold, funny and original, to this day no other film exists that is remotely similar. It's a western, action packed love story, it really is a one off.Three hours passed by effortlessly, it's one of those films where I wasn't aware of time passing by, I was engrossed and absorbed into it.Some of the humour is hilarious, and in the context of the film works to perfection, the humour is as good, as the violence and misery of slavery are guy wrenching.The music is absolutely wonderful, the perfect soundtrack accompanies this great film. Indeed the whole production is exemplary, it's a skilfully crafted film, the visuals are jaw dropping, it's very skillfully put together, with costumes, sets and lighting all on point, with the unbelievable staging as well.Now I am sometimes quick to highlight who stands out in a film or TV series, but how can you do that here, every single performance is on point, Waltz, Foxx, DiCaprio, Jackson, I honestly don't think it gets better than this assembly of greats.It's no wonder it gave us so many memes, who hasn't seen this masterpiece. If you haven't grab your remote, and improve your day.10/10."
tt0139414,"Good cast, shot very well, good effects (incredible effects if you consider it was 1999.)
This is well-done comedy, not ""so bad it's funny"" like some other bad flicks. The acting is good and the story makes sense. The next 2 in the series unfortunately ruin its good name, and prove quite demonstrably that effects are not just based on when the movie was released, but also how much funding goes into it. The first one AMAZING, for the times. The next 2, terrible for any time.
And let's not forget the incomparable Betty White. I've seen and re-seen this movie lots of times, Fun every time."
tt0111161,"I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I'm about to tell you why.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or cliched, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment on this film, I think he might say: ""Get busy watching, or get busy dying."" Take his advice.Thoroughly recommended."
tt1853728,"Highly entertaining movie! It's Quentin, so expect some flying blood and language. The basic story was endearing, but of course I didn't come away feeling all gushy and stuff - which is good cause I probably would be rating this movie lower if I had.There were some very funny moments in the film. I laughed out loud numerous times. Also, there are some classic Tarantino shots - like all the gunman coming into the house at one time. Stuff blew up and people were in shoot outs - right up my ally!!!I wish I had a better memory cause there are some awesome lines in this. Samuel L. Jackson threw out some fabulous one liners. They probably wouldn't be as funny out of context though. Still, he I think had the best funny lines.Obviously, I recommend the movie. It's Oscar nominated for a reason. I do recommend you NOT let children see this though. It's Tarantino.Favorite Scene: The Klan discussing the bags. Don Johnson was great!"

tt0111161,"A good prison movie whose cult of fans has made it into something so much more than it is. Greatest movie ever made? Get real. It's not even the greatest prison movie ever made. Hell, it's not even the best movie released in 1994! It's predictable and borrows heavily from decades of prison movie clich√©s. It's also nowhere near as deep as its staunchest admirers would have you believe. Still, it's an entertaining movie. Nice direction from Frank Darabont. Morgan Freeman is the highlight with a solid supporting cast. Tim Robbins, however, is borderline ridiculous at times with his cartoonish facial expressions and silly ""stares-off-into-the-distance"" moments. He's so far beneath Freeman as an actor it's sad. With a normal movie like this, I would focus more on the positives. I did give it a 7, after all. Unfortunately, it is easily the most overrated movie of all time (on IMDb, for sure) and as such the balance of positive to negative is out of whack."
tt0068646,"Alright, this movie is simply perfect. I don't have one bad thing to say about it honestly. Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest."
tt0108052,"Steven Spielberg, until the appearance of this film, was rightly noted mainly for his child's view of movies, fast action, easy sentiment, and a generally accurate sense of appeal to fantasy and wish fulfillment. He pretty much discarded that sort of innocence here, without leaving behind his appreciation of the commercial value of a story.It's impossible not to be deeply moved. The extermination program of the Nazis was the most horrific offense to human morality of the 20th century, and one of the worst in history. It wasn't the worst of the slaughters. The two world wars qualified for those honors. It wasn't even the worst example of ethnic cleansing, as it's come to be called. But more than six million Jews and more than seven million other undesirables -- homosexuals, the mentally ill, gypsies, political dissidents -- perished in the camps and not a single Jewish family in Europe went untouched. And it wasn't a war in which the victims were fighting back. It was a deliberate and very thorough act of genocide on the part of a people that Madame de Stael once described as ""a nation of poets and dreamers.""It's a kind of ""cross-over"" movie in which the protagonist is not Jewish but rather a Christian who comes to their rescue. A basically decent man comes to his senses. This is the formula, whether the despised and abused minority are Jews or African-Americans. If it were otherwise, there would be a danger of this being seen somehow as a ""Jewish"" movie by the unenlightened masses and, as a consequence, might suffer at the box office. Better ""In the Heat of the Night"" than ""Superfly.""But Spielberg has avoided most of the clich√©s associated with films of the final solution. No voice overs telling us of the suffering. No stock footage of bull dozers plowing corpses into mass graves. For the most part, the story stays at the personal level. (We hear hardly anything of the progress of the war.) And it's at this level that the film excels, due to the mature script and the performances of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Feinnes. There are many other characters, including Embeth Davidtz.The film is good because Neason's character begins not as a racist or a humanitarian but as a moral nihilist. He cares about nothing but money and the sensory pleasures it affords. He couldn't care less about the Jews, or about the Nazis either for that matter. The war to him is just a way of making a profit using cheap labor. And the script rises above the formulaic in not giving him a moment of epiphany. At no point does his brow furrow, his eyes light up, and he thinks to himself, ""My God, what am I doing?"" Nope. Instead, his development is informed by minor but important insights distributed here and there. After the surrender, he leaves the camp as a fugitive, dressed in prison clothes, mourning his carelessness in not saving more lives.Spielberg tells the story in a straightforward way but of course some incidents and dialog from events of fifty years ago must be fabricated. And the fabrications are well done. Especially enjoyable is the touchy, sometimes abrasive, and often humorous relationship between Neason, the salesman and con man who simply has no head for business, and Ben Kingsley as the matter-of-fact accountant who does. I'd give examples of some exchanges but there isn't space.Spielberg hasn't quite gotten over his taste for easy sentimentality. There are only two touches of color in this black-and-white movie. A little girl in a rose-colored coat appears two or three times, so that we can know who it is when her body is wheeled past in a barrow, just another victim. And when the workers hold a ceremony on Shabat, the candle flames are touched with a warm orange that signifies life. Effective, yes, but unnecessary in an adult film like this. Most people watching the film may be trusted to know what's going on without being nudged. But that's small stuff. Somewhat more embarrassing is a scene in which a German officer screams like a maniac and makes gargoyle faces at the camera after emptying his pistol into a mountain of burning bodies. Are we supposed to learn from this that the people running the camps were evil?The Nazi's extermination program prompted many studies in social science, none of which has contributed much to our understanding of why this, and similar programs, seem to be so common around the world. It's easy enough to blame Germany and the SS, but what happened in Kosovo, Maylasia, Cambodia, and Rwanda? Perhaps one of the reasons we've never really understood it is that we don't want to. Perhaps the answer lies not in ""F"" (for ""facism"") scales or ideographic studies of power but in the darkest aspects of human nature itself. Is there a group of people who have nothing in common but their ethnic identity that we ourselves would enjoy seeing wiped off the map? We all have massive cerebral cortices, much of the functions of which seem devoted to damping down impulses from structures lower down on the brain that generate desires to mate, to flee from danger, and to kill things and people that get in our way.Some day science might give us an answer but until then we have to rely on poets like Robert Burns.'Many and sharp the num'rous ills Inwoven with our frame! More pointed still we make ourselves Regret, remorse, and shame! And Man, whose heav'n-erected face The smiles of love adorn, - Man's inhumanity to man Makes countless thousands mourn!"
tt0993846,"Martin Scorcese magnificently directs this wild, funny and somewhat repugnant story based on Jordon Belfort's own tome. A bit long, but it is the most interesting and fast moving three hours you'll spend. An outstanding cast surrounding Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, a Long Island stockbroker that masterminded a massive securities fraud in the 1990s. This film depicts Belfort being a self-made man; albeit through partying hard, self over-medicating, no holds barred debauchery leading to his whirlwind approach leaving a mark on Wall Street. Belfort's charisma being able to attract followers in sharing his use of other people's hard earned money to live a life of beautiful women, exotic drugs, lavish homes and cars, and the utmost luxury making for a lush life. A master at scamming so well, he is a loud flaunting target for the FBI. It gets hard snitching on your closest friends, But Belfort manages to use the chance to garner a smaller stint in prison...36 months.Leave the kids at home, because THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is forewarned a deservedly hard R, due to strong sexual content, blatant drug use, language, violence and very graphic nudity. A strong supporting cast featuring: Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Rob Reiner, Kyle Chandler, Jon Bernthal and Matthew McConaughey."
tt0422272,"Going into Fragile, I wasn't sure what to expect. The reviews I had read were middling, but upon watching the film I found myself baffled by such comments. Fragile is a solid horror thriller in the same vein of magical realism and tension as The Orphanage. The film is excellently shot; Xavi Gim√©nez's cinematography recalls John Alcott's work on The Shining, truly evoking the haunting nature of an expansive abandoned building. Furthermore, I was blown away by Yasmin Murphy's role as Maggie. As a young actress, she seems to possess a subtlety beyond her years and plays excellently against Calista Flockhart. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and highly recommend it."
tt0133093,"I'm nowhere near as much of a fan of this flick as a lot of folks are, but I still love it. Some of the most impressive and enjoyable action sequences I've ever seen. I just wish I cared more for the story and imagery."
tt0372784,"To tell the truth, I thought the Batman franchise could never be saved, and I was really let down that I may never see my favorite superhero in a good movie ever again. Then I saw the preview to Batman Begins, I didn't really know what to think. New Batman. New Alfred. New story. New style. I wasn't sure why I wanted it 'the old way', but maybe I wanted to the actors in the Batman films I grew up with, to revive themselves and make a good Batman movie. I wanted Robin and sadly, Batgirl, alongside Batman saving the world from another familiar villain.I heard Batman Begins, and I thought great, this was called ""Batman"" in 1989, selfishly I said, ""I want something new!"".But, of course being a big Batman fan, I went opening night to Begings. 2 and half hours later, like the rest of the audience was completely blown away. It was the only movie I had ever been to (and yes I have been to some great ones) where the crowd claps and the end. This was not just golf claps for a popcorn clip, this was a standing ovation for 10:30 pm show in a crowded theater in Austin, Texas.I never would have thought this would have worked, even with Nolan directing. But I was wrong, so wrong. After seeing the X-Mens and Spidermans, I clearly thought Marvel had the upperhand and DC was just simply trying to keep up, again, so wrong.Nolan gave us a dark, gritty, and pleasantly realistic, view of Batman. Bale gives a tremendous performance as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Michael Caine was a fabulous Alfred, and Morgan Freeman almost stole the show as Luscious Fox.Even though X-Men and Spiderman(all of them) are wonderful superhero movies, Batman Begins, is just a good, no, great movie. And I think that is what blew people away, that it wasn't just some superhero, special effect, hero gets girl, good guy wins movie, it was a truly dark and well crafted movie, and it maybe stupid to say, but it didn't even feel like you were watching a superhero movie.I don't even think Burton, and his animated style(which works), could have revived this troubled series, that Schumaker wrecked, because like Fantastic Four and Daredevil, tried over do it and give us the latter part of things.So, here is to you Chris Nolan. You saved a franchise. You made an unforgettable movie, that will be remembered as the best superhero movie of all time, but just an all around great and unforgettable movie classic."
tt0372784,"I can't believe we waited 8 years for a Batman movie, and this is all they can come up with. This film is a complete mess, from the confused non-linear storytelling (whenever its convenient), to the amateur picture and sound editing, to the sloppy, distracting directing.I hate to say it, but I'd rather watch the Adam West version of Batman (which actually had some wit) or even the George Clooney/Joel Schumacher disaster, only because it provides SOME kind of entertainment (in a B Movie kind of way). This film is devoid of humour, wit, suspense, mystery or even drama. All scenes are clipped down to their climaxes, and we are never given a chance to catch our breath.Once again, we are given 3 (rather than 1) villains, which makes the film 1/3 as good as it could have been (no, not 3 times as good!), while it tries to cram 6 hours worth of story into one rushed 2 hours.It's cut together like a movie trailer, rather than a story, so you're never really 'inside' the plot. You don't feel the suspense, or even the moment-to-moment reality of what's happening. So many scenes come and go with no real contribution to the 'story' other than to 'update' you on what's happening with the characters at the moment (don't confuse that with a real story!).There are elements of the film--mostly superficial--that do work, but they barely register as a blip in this mess. Gary Oldman (our finest actor?) plays Sgt. Gordon to a 't', but his sub-plot doesn't allow for much of his 'man-on-the-inside' role that he provides in the comic. Ras-al-gul resembles the comic book version in name only, as he has somehow switched from an Arab to Liam Neeson as a samurai (!?!?).Looking back, the film should've focused on the Scarecrow (and maybe an earlier draft did; the original working title was Batman: Fear, and 'fear' seems to be the main theme of the piece). Cillian Murphy's unique features couldn't have been imagined by a comic artist. Like the re-created version in the animated series, Scarecrow actually looks scary, and uses a power that would've been more satisfying is he actually got to use it more. Katie Holmes is excellent, Morgan Freeman is fine, and Michael Caine is adequate (I'm not British, but his accent seems way off for Alfred).All in all, it seems that there MIGHT have been a good film in there somewhere, but it was simply ruined by last-minute editing and a soundtrack that seems like an afterthought ( usually the same boring song runs through several scenes in a row, reinforcing the 'movie trailer' feel). Then again, the weaknesses could lie with the most important creative choice of all: the writer.I don't know where David S. Goyer ever got the reputation as a good writer, but considering the only credits he has to his name are trash-film comic book adaptations, he must have another career as a playwright or a novelist. First he adapted Nick Fury for TV, which landed him the Blade trilogy. Blade, despite its unexplainable popularity, is typical dark fantasy/action movie garbage; all silver/blue colours, heavy metal soundtrack and 1 dimensional characters.I suppose the shareholders at Warner must've seen the numbers on Blade, because not only did they give him Batman, they also gave him the job of adapting the beloved Flash to the screen (God help us all).It just goes to show that Warner should've stuck with their original plan of letting Frank 'Sin City' Miller and Darren 'Pi' Aronofsky adapt 'Batman: Year One', but that would actually require them to base their decisions on talent rather than the (imagined) potential profits.Oh, well, another in a long line of comic book bombs, I suppose (after Elektra, Catwoman, Daredevil and Hulk, the future is already looking dark for superheroes). The sad thing is, the investors might look at the choice to let Christopher Nolan (Memento) to direct as a reason for its failure, and thus shy away from letting other 'indy' directors take on big budget superheroes. Sadly, this could mean the next Bat-film might star Will Smith and be directed by Michael Bay or Roland Emmerich.Where's Michael Keaton when you need him?3/10"
tt0120737,"I feel compelled to offer some dissent for this mistakenly lauded, and often drooled over catastrophe of a film. Let me preface this by saying that I have not read the book. While this may offend those of you who keep a copy under your mattress, you must understand that by releasing this as a motion picture, it must be able to stand on its own as one.My largest complaint is just that, the writers did absolutely nothing to prepare this story for the screen, other than relying on a gifted cinematographer and production designer to carry the weight. I felt every minute of this story as if it were being read from the pages of Tolkien's umpteenth printing by a four-year-old. The dialogue is slow, awkward, and unjustly sentimental. To someone who has not read the book and doesn't have the pretext of the characters and their motivations, the lines are just as mystical as the glowing ring that every one scampers around in fear of.Other than the spooky horsemen that chase around Frodo the cowardly protagonist, I simply could not find any reason for these middle earth misfits to do what they did. And if you don't find the scene where they all get together under ""Agent"" Hugo Weaving's direction and decide who's the bravest pussy in middle earth absolutely corny and remedial, then you just weren't listening. I'm still not sure what was less convincing: the ridiculous lines or the misdirected attempts to act them.After three hours, and having lost complete sensation in my ass, they have the audacity to end the movie when things are finally starting to happen. At least Star Wars was sufficiently independent in each of its chapters. I didn't have to wait three years and pay $24 to get a coherent story.On a positive note, I have to give credit to the DP and his aesthetic capture of New Zealand. Well done. Seeing your photography was the only aspect that made me feel value for my money. That applies to the inhabitants of New Zealand as well. Thanks for letting us expose your country to the world. I only hope that the leagues of trench coat-wearing D&D players flocking to your ports will spare you from the middle earth references they're dying to make."
tt0133093,"As the world and the movies head into a brand new millenium, old narrative formats have been gilded with all the techno/cyber concepts and jargon that now inundate us in our daily lives.  In no areas of filmmaking is this more true than the action/adventure and sci-fi genres.  Probably the most popular example to date comes in the form of ""The Matrix"", a film that actually chooses as its setting a never-never land located somewhere between reality and the abstract plane of cybernetics.The plot of the film, though too complex to reiterate here, is actually put forward in a fairly straightforward, comprehensible manner.  What is missing from the film is the essential grounding in reality that makes the audience care if the main characters succeed in their mission (to rescue the world of course) or fail.  Unlike say ""Enemy of the State"", which managed to grapple with the potential dangers of an over-computerized and mechanized society in a world with which we are all familiar, ""The Matrix"" takes us to a sci-fi world that never fully engages the audience in even its own reality.  Part of the problem may be that the film's visual designers settle for the conventional sci-fi view of the future world as a series of dark, cramped, fog enshrouded rooms and corridors familiar to us from countless such movies.  We follow the obviously well thought-out and meticulously explained storyline but find ourselves never particularly engaged in the characters or feel any stake in the outcome of the final resolution. As to the film's much vaunted special effects, they are, admittedly at times, intriguing, but since computer graphics now make even the most preposterous situations possible on the screen, the audience craves more than simply scattered moments of jawdropping visuals to engage its full attention.  ""The Matrix""  borders on dullness quite often during its overlong 136 minute running time.  Perhaps a movie that takes place in a world that really isn't a world needs a more engaging central character to make the audience care."
tt0468569,"...for, simply put, this is to comic book/graphic novel adaptations what The Godfather, Part II is to gangster movies. Relentlessly dark, brooding, tangled, mythic, disturbing, none of that alternating, and then some. Long, too. It is neither uplifting nor a place to park the kids.I devoured my share of comic books when much younger, and felt obliged but not compelled to sample their motion picture adaptations. In particular, no fan of the Batman series am I. Tim Burton aimed for weird and hit the target. Joel Schumacher aimed for Ken Russell and missed oh so wide. Christopher Nolan and company got the keys to the franchise and did something certifiably different. Hat's off for that.In sum...About a half-hour too long, and that final half-hour was action-packed befuddlement capped by not one but two unnecessary speeches that were effectively blotted out by that packed action.Heath Ledger's performance will echo in your mind for some time to come. It had to have echoed in his own. Grant the man rest.So will, or should, the performances of everyone else, most notably Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman for their respectively surprising turns of character.With age Eric Roberts looks like Willem Dafoe, and Nestor Carbonell looks unnervingly like Peter Mark Richman.I believe we're close to breaking the sound barrier of digital FX, where you don't appreciate them 'til they're hurled at you and can't appreciate them when you do.I've heard my share of edited gunshots and explosions for the year and quite possibly the next two or three. But at least the violence wasn't stylized. If I wanted that I'd rent A Clockwork Orange.What awards this film will win will be well and truly earned. All the same I can't guess where the franchise will go next. I sincerely hope it's left where it is, with the goal of applying the same considerable attention and resources to finding, learning, articulating and displaying something novel. The participants in this film are surely capable of all of that..."

Suffice to say I did not like this film, I will not continue to tell you the plot as many others have already done so, I would just tell you not to waste your hard earned cash, trust me, if you see it, you will not want to see it again and that is not a sign of a entertaining movie experience!!"
tt0167261,"(I watched the extended cut) The middle part of the Lord of the Rings -trilogy, The Two Towers (2002) managed to balance nicely between the intimate character driven moments of the first film and the massive (and long) battle sequences and ""epic"" atmosphere of the third film. The film also added a well crafted CGI-character to that mix, along with a wonderfully bleak story and a great soundtrack. The result was that Two Towers is somewhat the highlight of the trilogy; not bouncing so much around from scene to scene as the first or the third film and rid of the boring story moments of the The Return of the King (2003).The fellowship has broken and the film follows the three somewhat separate story lines of the remaining characters of the Fellowship of the Ring (2001), while adding new ones from left and right. Elijah Wood (Frodo) and Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) are again the strong points of the cast, Bernard Hill (Theoden) also a positive surprise. Andy Serkis does great work along with the effects team at bringing ""real"" life and emotion to the CGI -character of Gollum.The action scenes are fun to sit through, the drama keeps you interested and the definite battle scene is well build-up from the first words of warning to the last swings of swords and whatnots ‚Äì the film's good fantasy entertainment. Like the other films of the trilogy, it lacks the deeper and more""humane"" approach of the books the films are based on, concentrating more on the ""heavy on drama and action"" -scenes but I understand the thought process behind that decision. I'm not so much of a fan of the books, myself so that's not a ""big question"" for me.Peter Jackson (the director) managed to keep the multiple and branching story lines well in place, the film also looks great and contains a great otherworldly atmosphere throughout. It has some issues (I didn't find all the story lines interesting enough, the CGI in places is pretty awful in comparison to the best the film can offer, runs for a tad too long) but is a great movie experience to sit through. 3/4"
tt0111161,"Saying this is the #2 movie of all-time is like saying McDonald's makes the best hamburgers. They're both palatable, predictable, inoffensive products that are easy to digest. Both have happy endings-- that is, if you find the stunning speed with which a McDonald's hamburger flushes out your digestive tract to be a ""happy"" occasion.All you need to know is that Shawshank has the exact same ending as ""Trading Places."" So why not make ""Trading Places"" the greatest comedy of all-time?? What the hell, why not make it #3 on IMDb? It too is competent and utterly middle-of-the road in terms of quality and originality within its genre.Instead of Dan Ackroyd and Eddie Murphy laughing it up on a Caribbean beach after besting the forces of evil, we get Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.

tt7286456,"Joker is the main adversary of Batman. Going back to the 60s where tv where he was crazy and wicked, each version on the big screen has gone up a notch. Jack showed brillance and wicked as did Heath. Their ability to compete with a brilliant Batman was not just based on being the evil Batman, but his equal in brain power.Not so with this pychopath, who was been damaged so bad he shows no intelligence. Just pure evil. And that is not what the Joker is. This Joker is an embarressment and when you walk out of the movie you will know this is not the Joker, this is Michael Myers in clown face.Some of the plot is well thought out, making the rich the true evil and blaiming everything on Thomas Wayne, and Mom Fleck, and bullies and everyone else. And Joker ""coming out"" by killing 3 sleezeball ""stock trader"" types that brought all of this on themselves. The first 2 deserved it and it would have been self defence, but then he hunted down and shot the third in the back as he was trying to get away. From there it was just a horror movie with clownface. Then the upset mobs, tired of their lot in life make him their hero. Kinda like OJ and Trump.No it's not political Joker says, but yes it is. It is preachy and a terrible movie."
tt0172495,"Having read in a Los Angeles major newspaper critique that this was the BEST movie of the year,  I witnessed this movie expecting a 4 star performance. However I was somewhat disappointed by the extreme use of computer graphics. I deliberately haven't read any comments from other viewers or any other reviews so I could write unfettered.  The emperor, the son of Marcus Aurelius, was the best actor along with his father. The fight scenes were excellent but they were mostly camera motion and sound effects. How one man could survive hand to hand combat with a never ending no. of physically fit combatants was hard for me to believe.  And lastly,  I missed out on hearing a large number of words. My wife seconds the motion on that one as well.  All in all a relatively fast-paced entertaining movie but it did not come close to The Patriot which I thoroughly enjoyed."
tt0993846,One of the rare occasions when a potentially great film becomes BAD courtesy of its running time.I have truly never experienced so much fluff in a movie before. And what's worse it was totally unnecessary because the material was there and it was more than enough.I can't even begin to praise the merits of The Wolf of Wall Street (it did have a few) because the redundant scenes and dialogue are too much to get over. It's sort of like trying to enjoy a fine steak while tofu is being forcibly stuffed down your throat. It's all ruined.All and all what a pity. It could have been the best movie of the year if only.....
tt0361748,"In the 1st 10 minutes of the films, Tarantino used about 10 different fonts for various on screen titles. Might not seem like a big deal to most folks, but it is an early example of the films' sloppy inconsistency. QT has always liked to mix genres, most successfully in the Kill Bill films, and I'm fine with that. But here, his A.D.D.-enabled multi-style style is at its most random and really doesn't work for what this film could've been. (I considered offering a list of all the inconsistencies, but my reviews are generally too long anyway.) What I had hoped for, and what the trailer seemed to promise, was a Dirty Dozen homage, where a team of badass characters are assembled with the mission of killing Nazis. Generally, in that type of group mission film (Dirty Dozen, Oceans 11, The Seven Samurai or even QT's own Reservoir Dogs), you'd get to know a bit about each of the members of the team, building some kind of relationship between the various characters and the audience. But QT doesn't take the time to do that. We never really get to know any of the people in the film. Instead, he spends a few slow 20 minute sections in ways that don't enhance our relationships with the characters, the story or the film overall.So what's good? 1. The film does offer some fantastically funny and quirky performances. Brad Pitt is hilarious, and the film's main villain SS Col. Landa, played by Christoph Waltz, is as funny as he is batshit crazy evil. Pretty much all of the supporting cast, with the exception perhaps of 1 or 2 of the 'Basterds', are also noteworthy. 2. No one knows how to use music in films better than Q. 3. A bunch of Jews kick a whole bunch of Nazi butt in some particularly gratifying (and gruesomely violent) ways.Final say? Disappointing, but worth seeing. Not for the kids or for people who don't like seeing Nazis die."

tt0509932,Easily one of the top episodes of all time with an all star cast. Not to be missed. This one episode epitomizes the entire series.
tt0111161,"In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were ""just happy to be nominated."" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word ""go,"" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on ""that 'Rickshaw' movie."" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, ""it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale."" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; ""In here's where you need it most,"" he says. ""You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch."" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking ""that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass"" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it.It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much better than this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, ""It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying."""
tt0103247,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS After reading both of Jack London's novels CALL OF THE WILD and WHITE FANG in that order, I felt it necessary to see the film again since I hadn't seen it for years.Expecting nothing but a regurgitated clone of lassie from the mouse house, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the film followed the storyline in its own right (though with some flaws).We start it in the Klondike Gold rush in the Yukon in Canada with Jack Conroy (Ethan Hawke pre-beard) arriving in the Yukon. He joins with a couple of old friends of his father to join in heading for their claim. At the same time, a young wolf cub is being brought up in the wilderness by his mother who, in a sequence concerning Conroy (Hawke) is shot and injured when she tries to lure one of Conroy's friend's dogs away to attack (and undoubtedly eat).And now comes the tarnishing part of the film that is the one part that I loathe and despise. She drags herself back to her cub before dying in front of him and leaving him to fend for himself in the wilderness. It's very frustrating to see Disney resort to the Bambi-esquire clich√© of killing off the mummy to tug at the heartstrings, especially since there's no evidence of this in the book, his mother was actually an important character, and not to forget that most of us will have seen it all before! The sequence in the book that this campfire part is based on, was before White Fang was even born, and the gradual growing climax that it built in the Jack London novel is terrifying! (Though I suppose that has no place in a Disney film.) If you intend to read the book, I won't spoil it for you!Afterwards, Conroy comes across the pup in certain circumstances where he has been taken in by the Indians and changes hands to take part in illegal dog-fighting before winding up in the hands of Conroy to rehabilitate him. These plot lines follow fairly accurately to the original London novel, albeit with some deviations, e.g: White Fang's mother was called Kiche and was taken in by the Indians, only to be separated from White Fang when she was sold to another Indian, Jack Conroy never appeared in the book, though he is similar to Weedon Scott's character in the novel.The ending to White Fang was bugged with one or two clich√©s, in that with a gold claim freshly unearthed and ready to leave for California, he lets him ""free"" because ""he'd be miserable in a city"" though White Fang went TO a new urban home later. We're not too sure why Jack decides to stay in the wilderness either, especially when there's a new life as a rich man in California waiting, except for White Fang to return to him and for them to be reunited (as they are) and a possible instinct of this happening, but it's not very well explained.It's also totally different to that of the ending of the book (that ends in California in the same way Call of the Wild starts there), but before I condemn it, I still have some praise for it being not so lassie-esquire to the effect of being nauseating, satisfying in its own right and closing the story nicely.Perplexingly though, the end tacks on a concluding text from the Defenders of Wildlife that says that ""JACK LONDON'S White Fang is a work of fiction. There has never been a documented case of a healthy wolf or pack of wolves attacking a human in North America. Because wolves were systematically eliminated throughout most of the United States during our early history and continue to be persecuted today, a nationwide effort is underway to reintroduce wolves into wilderness areas and insure their survival for generations to come."" Firstly, White Fang is set in Canada (sorry to be picky but people may still think that wolves have attacked people elsewhere).Secondly, I don't see why the film needs an epilogue like this - it isn't a nature documentary, it's a story! Maybe this is because the film is from 18 years ago when people were more prejudiced about wolves, and though I think wolves are great animals and it is important to protect them, it seems unnecessary to tack this information on at the end!In general, I would recommend this film, whether you've read the book or not. Despite the faults I've listed and the Godawful Bambi-style rubbish, White Fang does have its saving graces. The relationship between Conroy and White Fang is excellently portrayed, and quite poignantly acted by Hawke and Jed the wolf (or wolf-dog, whichever one he falls into). The backdrops of Canada in both Spring and Winter are nothing short of breathtaking, and combined with the settings of the late 19th Century, put us in a real and harsh, but beautiful world that draws you in. If you've read the book, then remember it's Disney and they are liable to changing story material for film-making. Just don't take it too seriously.I wouldn't touch MYTH OF THE WHITE WOLF with a 10 ft fishing pole, though!"
tt1853728,"This film is not recommended.The D is silent in Quentino Tarantino's blood-soaked film, Django Unchained, and so will you be, sitting there in the movie theater watching endless scenes of carnage and slaughter that co-mingles with the blaxploitation genre in this revisionist Western tale of revenge.¬† At the core of all this bloodshed and violence are the historic issues of slavery and racism, but Tarantino uses a spaghetti western format to hone in on his underlying message. Racial stereotypes, offensive white characters, and ethnic slurs abound. But so does action and dark humor, minus the wit, in this brutal parody of the Old West.Django Unchained is essentially a tale of vengeance and black empowerment, told by the talented Tarantino. But with all his Black Like Me posturing, ¬†the director takes over the role of the angry white man speaking for the entire African-American race. It all seems a bit ludicrous and egotistical to lessen the horror of racism as a vehicle for pop entertainment. That said, Django Unchained is an extremely well-made film worthy of the attention from the more seriously-minded faction of adult film-goers, but its outlandish plot and excessive treatment of violence kept the movie too absurd for me to truly appreciate. ( I may come off as self-righteous but I do tend to over-react and worry when the abhorrent subject of slavery parades itself as pop entertainment for a younger generation, muddying the historical content to become a pale substitute for their only possible history lesson on that issue.¬† Fiction can so willingly become fact these days. I also question the R-rating slapped onto this blood-fest when a NC-17 rating is more befitting, with all the endless shootings, stabbings, and bludgeoning going on under the guise of vigilante justice in this film. )After an hour's worth of slow-moving episodic detours and sub-plots involving repetitive shoot-em-ups, the film finally settles down to its main storyline, which is at least compelling:¬† A slave, Django ( Jamie Foxx ), searches for his wife, Broomhilda ( Kerry Washington ) who is now the property of an wealthy plantation owner, Calvin Candies ( Leonardo DiCaprio ). On his journey for salvation, Django befriends a bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz ( Christoph Waltz ), and both continue on their rescue mission to Candyland ( the plantation's ironic name ).Now Tarantino has used this same set-up before in his previous films, a series of misadventures until the final climactic shoot-out takes place. It's his calling card. His solid filmmaking techniques and edgy style stays evident throughout his lengthy film. So does his gift for well-written conversations and flamboyant characters.¬† But his screenplay needs more reworking to streamlining his film's potent message and there is in dire need of eliminating unnecessary complications within its plot structure.Beside his ever-present trademark non-stop gratuitous violence, Tarantino's anachronistic blending of pop, hip-hop and rap songs, along with modern sounding jargon, sharply contrasts the visual images on display with mixed results. He overdoes the pop culture references this time around. The excessive use of the N-word ( estimated usage: nearly 100 times, without exaggeration ) seems to be here more for its shock value purposes that authenticity and richness in dialog.Where the director / writer achieves success is in his wisely assembled ensemble of actors for their overly ripe roles.¬† Waltz brings to his role a commanding presence and larger-than-life bravado. Washington creates a gripping portrait of a woman caught in a desperate struggle for freedom.¬† Also on hand in a small supporting role is a Tarantino favorite, Samuel L. Jackson, giving another ballsy performance as a morally corrupt man servant.¬† However, it is the film's evil villain that makes Django Unchained break free of its caricatural qualities. As Calvin Candies ( a.k.a. Simon LaGree channeling Snidely Whiplash ), DiCaprio is a guilty pleasure. The actor puts his underused comic talents to good service and astutely navigates a difficult role to great acclaim, creating such an indelible reprehensible scoundrel.¬† Yet, what throws the film slightly off-balance is Foxx in the title role.¬† The actor looks the part, but, strangely, seems too reserved and solemn for this empowered hero. Foxx does little to circumvent the subtle demands of this complex character.¬† He becomes a stock character, The Man with No Game.The film rambles on, with too many side stories that do little to advance the action. More judicious editing is needed which would also help pick up the film's lackadaisical pacing. As the case with most Tarantino films, scenes go on far too long to build tension that has already been established.¬† Humor seems sparse or sophomoric as set pieces drone on with no real purpose.Django Unchained is a live-action cartoon with an adult perceptiveness. Tarantino's films always have a divisive effect and this latest venture is no different. His re-boot of the Western for today's movie-going audiences will thrill only his die-hard fans and alienate others. Yes, dear moviegoers, there is plenty of red for your hard-earned green this holiday season, and its name is Django Unchained.¬† And, yes, while the D may remain silent, it can also stands for disappointing as well. GRADE: C+Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.comNOTE: Be forewarned, moviegoers: This film is one of the most violent film in recent memory. Lately, with all of the senseless murders and on-going anarchy happening in America, this film could easily become the poster child for the N.R.A. and its recent stance against gun control and Hollywood filmmakers in general.¬† Tarantino may not want his film to be seen in this light, but this film ( and many of his other movies ) could become a painted target for the Conservative Right mentality and close-minded gun enthusiasts with which to take aim."
tt0137523,"Uninteresting, clich√©d look at capitalism, moralism and human nature.....yadda, yadda, yadda. I think the appeal to the masses must be the ""cool"" rebel element. I just found that boring and senselessPitt and Norton are fine and actually necessary for the film to even be watchable.Roger Ebert said it best ""Women, who have had a lifetime of practice at dealing with little- boy posturing, will instinctively see through it; men may get off on the testosterone rush""Yes, we see through it and are embarrassed that this movie is rated so highly"
tt0468569,"The trick to these comic book superhero movies is not to take the source material too seriously. That's what made the original Batman from the 1980's, with Jack Nickolson as the Joker, work so well; everything about that movie, including all the main characters, was over the top, and rightfully so. We are, after all, talking about a man who goes out and fights crime while dressed up as a bat. How seriously, really, are we supposed to take such a notion? But this movie (among its various other flaws) takes itself WAY too seriously. It's supposed to be some deep, even epic, tale of, well, something. But, hey, if I want that, I could read Homer. Or Shakespeare. Or watch ""The Godfather"". Stories that truly are epic, in no small part because they feature real human characters, not ones that came out of a cartoon book.That said, I can only review so much of this movie because, quite honestly, I don't remember all that much from it. Nothing about it truly stood out in my mind, other than that the general theme seemed to be to inflict upon the audience several scenes of considerable cruelty and sadism. And, unlike in other movies where these qualities played a significant role (Silence of the Lambs, Apocalypse Now), here these elements seem to exist solely for shock value, not because they actually add anything to our deeper understanding of the story.Which brings us to the character of the Joker. Let me be blunt - Nickolson's Joker was at least ten times better than this one. Both are completely unbelievable, but Jack's Joker was at least interesting, even fun. He was a pleasure to watch in much the same way that a good James Bond villain is. But there is nothing pleasurable at all about Heath Ledger's Joker. First off, he is so psychotic that he couldn't function anywhere outside of an insane asylum; he kills off his own henchmen, burns their stolen money before their very eyes, yet this psycho somehow enlists a small army of loyal followers without giving them any reason to be loyal at all, and yet, despite being a complete walking mental meltdown, he manages to put in motion any number of very detailed terrorist plots that would require the exact opposite mindset, namely, one of cold and calculating rationality. In short, as a movie villain, he simply fails. Not only is he not credible at all, his sole contribution to the story is to add the aforementioned cruelty and sadism, making this not only a stupid and unbelievable movie, but a thoroughly depressing one as well. I mean, seriously. If you want to see movie characters who have a dark, twisted, and sadistic streak and yet come off as credible on the screen, one need look no further than such persons as Tommy from ""Goodfellas"" or Luca Brasi from ""The Godfather"". But the Joker from this film is just a void. Encountering his character was like stepping on a dog turd. The experience is wholly unpleasant and disgusting, but thankfully you forget about it pretty soon.3/10"
tt0110912,"I was very underwhelmed by this film. I thought thought that the performances, while excellent given the flimsy material, were so unfounded in depth of character which made me think ""ok, why should i care whether he dies? or whether she dies? or whether he cant pay back the gangsters?"" I found the interwoven stories to be a nice idea however the sheer length of each story for approximately 15-20 minute intervals made me lose any interest i had with the previous characters. To this end the film became this consistently unfunny, boring, benign experience to which there was no reason to care about the characters, the plot or the subtext, and the ending while clever was very longwinded with no beneficial or worthy climax.3 stars given for 1) John Travoltas performance 2) occasionally witty lines/conversations 3) the opening scene in the diner"
tt0361748,"My second time seeing this and I thought I would be rolling my eyes and instead, I am liking it. Not historical, not realistic by any means but if you pay attention it is funny in places despite all the gore. And who doesn't like hating Nazis? Worth watching if only to see the evil ones get their due. THAT's rewarding in itself."
tt0139414,"Let us all take time to celebrate the second coming. Ahh, maybe not, but Lake Placid has some of the class needed to start a religion. The higher quality of this movie is to be found under a few inches of self-irony. One should not try to take LP serious or expect to get scared or anything like that. It is all about the laughs. I think it is great that we finally get a cover-horror that is more than just a bunch of rip-off scenes from Scream and Star Wars. I mean, we are talking of an event big enough to match female oil-wrestling, while drinking an umbrella-topped Tai-Mai. And that is quality time, folks!! So get it together and watch the darn movie. You will either love it (like yours truly) for the intense rediculous humor, or hate it for the intense rediculous humor. Either way you will be able to thank Hollywood for giving us one the greatest masterpieces in horror/comedy/stupidity known to homo sapiens. That's man. So give it try - you might end up liking it. Believe me. It is worth celebrating!"
tt0133093,"If you are some small programmer working for some big company, doing all day the same stupid work you might fall for the idea that your life is not as boring and senseless as it seems (and maybe actually is), but that you are in fact the god and creator of this world. The normal reaction should be: Turn that computer off, take a vacation, maybe seek professional help. You can also make a movie...Matrix is not boring, it`s tense and it has stunning visuals. But like a good video clip does not make the music worth listening to, a whole bunch of special effects do not make a great movie.After watching the Matrix I recognized that:1. I don't get why super-robots, who overwhelmed the whole human kind, are not able to build some nuclear power plants, despite the fact that they really needn't care about radioactive pollution. Instead they get their energy from humans, and if you take a look at their body ""farms""  you must agree that it looks like they are putting a lot more energy into it than they get out of it... A good movie (even if it's science fiction) should provide some ground level logic in its story.2. I did not care about the characters. They die? Hmmm, okay. Trinity loves Neo? Uh, why is that? Did I miss something? A good movie makes me feel for the characters and understand their reactions. In this point Matrix is a total failure. Ever watched Brazil? You maybe should if you'd like to see a good ""big brother"" picture.3. This pseudo religious bla bla. Realize that there is no spoon? I realized that there is something else missing somewhere in the story writers head. Well, wouldn't be so bad, if there weren't point 1 and 2.4. This background theme of being something better than the others. Uh, am I really just some role playing games liking informatics student? Or am I the master of the universe? Look in the mirror, decide for yourself...does not look like Keanu Reeves? What a surprise.Watch this movie, it won't bore you. But if you think your going to see a REALLY good movie, or even a masterpiece, keep away from it. You will be quite disappointed afterwards.Ah, and if you like MTV...this is the best movie ever made. ;)5/10"
tt0109830,"This film is one of my all time favorite film. He goes through life on a cloud, which could be each of us. I hated that she penned the baby on him, which is crazy. I love the fact of the Bama football, roll tide. This is a great film, powerful, magical, passionate. He had a good life, only thing he couldn't figure out why she just didn't love him. I loved the comedy, also didn't know Tom had it in him. This film had some very powerful moments, that are life lessons. The story is truly a ride of a life time.

tt0816692,"Interstellar - ReviewCertain things in life are precious. Very precious. And so was the Film for me.Why you might ask?Well seldom do i get the chance where i find myself sitting in a cinema anxious and intrigued by what might come. In a time where trailers are omnipresent and going to the movies without having seen one seems unreasonable, outright stupid to some i had the magical chance to find myself in front of the IMAX on a cold November night with 2 tickets to Interstellar. My only knowledge was that Nolan directed it and McConaughey stars in it.The images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by Hans Zimmer and his Music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. And there it was.. The ending. I couldn't believe it . I was reliving, rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment, the smell of popcorn, my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? Ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes....Well apparently people enjoy movies different than i do. Maybe i should start watching trailers again :)."

tt0139414,"It's abundantly clear that 20th Century Fox doesn't know the difference between a crocodile and an alligator. If the producer/writer had merely taken time to visit a good library, they'd have discovered that an alligator will make every attempt to avoid human beings--and has a bulbous snout--as the creature in this poor movie did. A crocodile is another matter entirely--an aggressive, fearless and fearsome reptile, which will hunt human beings for food. Stan Winston, whose creature effects are usually well done, gave us instead an alligator--period. The beast was not especially frightening. Just as importantly, the human logic was entirely missing. When Betty White led the blindfolded cow down to the river, in plain sight of the predator, the poor dinner plate simply ambled down to the water's edge to meet its quick end. Any animal can scent danger and it made this scene not only absurd but unnecessarily cruel. And why would any human being put himself in harm's way, standing only a few yards away from a supposedly carnivorous reptile? The film's premise was non-existent--no crocodile can survive north of the equator except in equatorial Africa and in the Indo-Pacific region. Moreover, crocodile ""expert"" Hector Cyr was mistaken when he told his rapt audience that crocodiles cannot swim in salt water. Apparently, this ""expert"" never heard of the feared salt water crocodile, the aggressive man-eaters of northern Australia, also known as the Indo-Pacific crocodile. These crocodiles, which have more of a menacing reputation than their Nile cousins, regularly take to the salt water in the region, swimming from one island to another in search of territory and prey. If writers can be as well paid as David Kelley, where do I get in line? His ""script"" was something a child could have turned out. As for the ""acting,"" I simply can't imagine that accomplished people such as Bill Pullman and Oliver Platt signed on for such nonsense. Bridget Fonda should be ashamed of herself, given her acting pedigree. She's dropped like a stone from her early promise in ""Single White Female."" She pulled off two impossible feats--swimming away from an attacking ""crocodile"" in dark water at night, and holding her breath for over a minute. This cinematic disaster has put her career in a mid-air stall and it seems that she can either go back to acting school or find another career. The locale for such a film should have been in tropical waters to at least force the viewer to find some credibility in a premise entirely without one. Crocodile attacks are frightening events and people lose their lives to them each year, not only in Africa, along the Nile, but also in the Indo-Pacific region where crocodylus porosus [the saltwater] is king. The technology exists for a ferocious, life-like, man-eating crocodile than the stretched-out alligator the Winston factory [I can hear the yawns in the workshop] thoughtlessly turned out. Better actors exist to give weight to a story line which has not yet been filmed, and better writers and directors exist to craft a dramatic story line into a gripping and terrifying film. I left the theater extremely disappointed. I'm embarrassed for the crocodile, which deserved better."
tt0468569,"Like many a thing, keeping it simple is one way to make it good. As much as I loved Batman Begins, I disliked The dark Knight.The movie wanted to cram so many sub-plots into it that at some time I didn't know exactly where it was going. And is this movie really about Batman??? If it was, there are some features in it that made it look like a CHEAP Batman:1. OK, Wayne's manor was destroyed, blah blah. But making Batman roar out of a CONTAINER??? Can we make this any cheaper? An underground lair for Batman that seems to contain NOTHING but a table and a chair and a few other stuff???? Production could have made a little effort there, really... 2. Batman's costume, frankly didn't look THAT better than the Batman wanna-bes.And what's that fuss about dogs? Batman's costume isn't dog proof. It's bullet proof, fire-proof, shock-proof and nearly stupid-proof but please don't unleash the dogs on poor Batman... pathetic, really.The movie in itself does not lack action and blow-away special effects, but the storyline really lacks of substance. We see Batman in a supporting role, to do what others ask him to do, we don't see Batman as the leader and coming up with unexpected plans and twists - U gotta bring back the Chinese guy, OK I'll go. -U gotta save the hostages, I'll go. U gotta do this, do that? I'll go. Anything else? Tea or Coffee anyone?Not the best movie, at any cost. Not of the year nor of any time, sorry..."
tt0172495,"Movie is technically very fine i have watched in theater twice and i like it much as lots of turks but sometime after the reason why we loved this movie became clear this was only a western look over an old Turkish movie series Tarkan... Maximus was so Turkic that he was wearing lamb fur(lamb was introduced by Huns to Europe) instead of bright armors of Romans,Like Tarkan he rides along his wolf, his family has been murdered by his foes ... you can claim that these may be inspirations of Ridley Scott from Tarkan but there are some scenes taken directly from Tarkan movies...1- Maximus fights a big German guy - Tarkan's fight against Giant Orso both are under snow.. 2- After the fight in arena, emperor orders death- neither Tarkan nor Maximus kill the victims. 3-The scene of birds over Rome 4-The appear order and camera movements in the arenaat least the final is different, Maximus dies though Tarkan is immortal"
tt0108052,"As possibly the world's most influential film-maker, Spielberg has a responsibility. And that responsibility entails NOT using his cheesy, shallow sensibilities to turn one of the most profoundly horrible parts of human history into a soap opera-style piece of fluff. This film is more than just a bad film, it is a downright dangerously bad film that will be watched by millions of impressionable people who might have had few other sources to base their knowledge of the Holocaust on. Most of us agree that the worst thing to do about something like the Holocaust is to forget it, lest it happen again. The next worst thing is to trivialise it to the point where it resembles so many other Hollywood pieces of trash.What possesses a man who has become rich and powerful in the film industry solely through the making of shallow, transparent films for children to think that he is talented and wise enough to present to the masses a subject which should only be touched by the most careful and socially responsible hands? A Mid-life crisis, and an over-inflated ego, most likely, not that it matters though.Only someone with many years of study may be a doctor; only an experienced engineer may build a bridge, and even the guy who fixes your toilet must be a qualified plumber. Yet this fool, whose only previous qualifications have been cheap, shallow, movies made strictly for entertainment, thinks he is in a rightful position to educate our children. Because, unfortunately, many people have a frighteningly limited amount of knowledge about the second world war, and Schindler's List will be for many of them their main source of information. Showing it to them in as cheesy and hollow a fashion as almost only Spielberg can, is simply a crime."
tt0167261,"The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring was a fantastic start to Tolkien's epic tale. The only true weakness of The Two Towers -- if you can call it a flaw -- is that the film is the middle-child, in that it has no beginning and no end. Though it starts out where the first ended, The Two Towers begins with a recap of Gandalf's battle with the Balrog as we continue to see their fight as they plummet thousands (if not miles) of feet through gaping chasms in the Mines of Moria.The acting is just as great as the first, and with the addition of new characters, the film's atmosphere has gone from ""new and wondrous"" to ""grim and hopeless"". Needless to say, Andy Serkis as Gollum is one of the best performances of the new decade. Bernard Hill does a wonderful job as Theoden, as well as Miranda Otto as Eowyn. Karl Urban is a nice choice as Eomer, nephew of the king. Possibly the best of the new characters is Faramir, played by David Wenham. Unlike the passive-type as portrayed in the books, this Faramir is more troubled and only corruptible by the Ring because of his desire to be accepted by his close-minded father -- a nice change made by the writers. The character Treebeard is a reflection of the greatness of the CG work on Gollum; both are exquisite.The writing and directing equals The Fellowship of the Ring, in that the continuity remains, never feeling like we missed any key moments in the plot. The only real flaw, which is mainly due to pacing and events leading up to The Return of the King, is the vast expansion of Frodo and Sam's journey to Mordor, aided by the insidious Gollum. The changes and omissions were once again necessary to provide a decent pace and focus on the ever-rising tension of what all leads up to: the battle at Helm's Deep. Yet, with the massive battle near the final 30-40 minutes of the film, there's plenty more to keep a viewer attached to the screen.Fully seeing the MASSIVE software at work, the special effects incorporated with the miniatures/bigatures still dazzle the eyes in flawless execution, as 10,000 Uruk-hai soldiers lay siege to a seemingly impenetrable fortress. From the Mumakil (elephants) to the Fell Beasts upon which the Ringwraiths ride, we are given the introduction of creatures that play major roles in the following film.Howard Shore's evolution with the leitmotifs he created from the first film have now been shifted towards a more explosive composition. Equaling The Fellowship of the Ring, the music for The Two Towers is nothing short of awe-inspiring. From the theme of Rohan to the thundering might of Isengard, The Two Towers is full of rousing composition. There's also beautiful moments between Aragorn and Arwen, as well as some wonderful choral work for the last march of the Ents.Overall, while different from the text in terms of time-line, The Two Towers is an extraordinary sequel to a ""trilogy"" destined for greatness. While the film ends before the events in Shelob's tunnel, there's no doubt one will be amazed in what is to come. One must see this film."
tt0167261,"In the Two Towers (TT) we are re-united with most of our heroes from the Fellowship of the Ring (FotR). Split apart by betrayal, and a company of orcs, Frodo and Sam have begun the last leg of their quest to Mordor. Ant and Dec (sorry, Merry and Pippin) are prisoners of the orcs, pursued by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli ¬ñ a quest that brings the company, and the people of Rohan, closer to conflict.Opinion is divided about the second film. The entertainment junkies seem to think it's better than the first, largely on account of the Battle of Helms Deep, which is rather impressive. I thought it was a bit weaker, mainly because, in a wilderness adventure, there's more emphasis on the characters than in the spectacle of set piece action; and because the CGI is less subtle as a result.Once again, liberties are taken with the story. There's no riding of the Grey Company. There's a more obvious tension between Eowyn and Aragorn (Legolas has to remind Aragorn who he's dating), and (controversial among the Tolkienites) Faramir's character has been darkened somewhat. In fact, the directorial trait of adding more colour to the main characters while painting out the subtlety of the peripheral ones continues from FotR. Partly because we're introduced to more characters in TT, the overall effect leaves the film slightly two-dimensional. On balance I thought the treatment of Faramir to be less heinous than that of Denethor in Return of the King, but more on that later.The mood, though, remains pure Tolkien and that, more than anything, is the triumph of the movie. From the Beowulf-like set for Meduseld (Tolkien famously nicked his description of the seat of Rohan from the UK's first epic) to the majestic sweep of New Zealand, the film more than once reminded me of my own mental images of Tolkien's world. And, once again, I found myself interested in the story.So, to the flaws. I mentioned in an earlier review of FotR the astonishing heighism in Peter Jackson's adaptation. You can imagine Jackson scratching his head wondering what to do for laughs now that Ant and Dec have been nicked by Ugluk, Grishnakh and the lads. His solution is ingenious; find the next shortest member of the company. Gimli, therefore, shoulders the mantle of comedy relief. As a strapping man of 6'4'' I am allowed a certain disdainful disinterest to such a phenomenon; but it is worth noting. Also worth noticing is the astonishing transformation of Arwen from a feisty, most un-Tolkien lady in FotR to the submissive pre-Raphaelite stereotype of the books. I guess this is because Eowyn has turned up, but still. The Elves still speak like they're doped up, except the peculiarly immune elfin fancy boy, Legolas. On that note, was it really necessary for him to mount his horse that way? Or surf his way down a staircase at the battle of Helms Deep? Jim Horner should do an alternative Beach Boys theme for that scene.Anyway, these are minor points in a film that is, if not a major, then at least a minor, triumph. As mentioned by others, the film is worth seeing for Gollum alone. And I can think of many more reasons to see it. You could also check out the extended version, which is even better. 7/10."
tt0110912,"I really find it difficult to believe this movie is rated highly by people. It's hands down the worst movie I've seen in my life (58 years). When my wife and I went to see it, soon after it came out, multiple people walked out of the theater saying either it was a terrible movie and/or it sickened them. Maybe all of us were just allergic to Tarantino's sick fascination with violence. The violence is just so gratuitous and casual as to make it seem like a bad video game. Outside of that, the overall movie has the feel of being viewed through the eyes of someone high on bad drugs. Please excuse my lack of specifics regarding the film, but I've fortunately blocked most of them from my memory. In any event, I worry about a society that thinks this is a good film, I really do."
tt0114369,"Wow. There are a lot of bad films out there, but even with the worst of the worst there is some redeeming quality, like that neato big wave in the Perfect Storm. But Se7en? The acting is flat (Brad Pitt's opening lines seem like they're coming from someone acting for the first time, his moaning at the end, when he gets his special gift, just seemed pathetic); the script is not at all inventive and unsuccessfully covered up by hyperbolic special effects and redundant gore. The ""twist"" at the end is hardly disturbing because the writer/ director have been shoving gimmicky horror effects down the our throats for the entire movie.People who like this film- the dark, urban atmosphere, the pseudo-noir elements: please watch some David Lynch films and see how this should be created, i.e. not by using video game titles, not by relying heavily on special effects, make-up, and yet ANOTHER plot with biblical references, but instead by a careful selection of actors, beautiful cinematography, and incredibly original stories.Stop funding this director so that he will go back to making TV commercials instead of two hour long theater commercials."
tt0816692,"I was expecting a great movie especially with an all Star Cast. What ruined the movie for me were WORDS - SPEECH. Before you can enjoy a movie you must be able to understand the dialogue. I found myself and my aunt continually saying to each other ""What did he just say"". And she couldn't tell me nor could I tell her. Matthew McConaughey especially spoke to low, he seemed to mumble a lot and let his voice drop to a whisper as he was speaking. We left saying ""What just happened, what was this movie about"". I think if we could have understood everything they said we could have gotten something from the movie. Sometimes the sound effects drowned out the dialogue. The special effects were outstanding but that doesn't make a movie if you don't know what the Characters are saying. I feel like I need a refund."
tt0114369,"Seven has become a huge public success all over the world. That I can understand. What I find more surprising is that it also got well received by the critics. Most praised it as well made, exciting and original thriller. Some even thought it was a masterpiece. But in my opinion, Seven doesn't provide the genre of police thriller noting new than dim lighting and copious amount of rain.Because Seven has much more in common with other films in this genre than most people realized. A couple of clich√©s are that there's a team of two cops who investigates the case consists of an old black man who is tired of his job and look forward to his retirement. The other one is his opposite; a young white man who wants up.The murders that Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (Brad Pitt) are investigating has been done with the seven deadly sins as source of inspiration. The killer also leaves short literature quotes. Mainly Dante, something that makes  Somerset (of course the intellectual of the two cops) take Mills (who only seems to read Guns and Ammo) to the library.Director David Fincher - whose only feature film before this was Alien 3, but loads of music videos behind - reasoned ""I don't feel at home in libraries either... What music should I pick? It has to be something cultural. At least we take something that everybody recognizes - Air by Bach.Seven doesn't have any other intentions than being the two hour thriller with some disgusting corpses, an odd police couple and a crazy killer it actually is. Then it should be regarded as such and nothing more."
tt0372784,"I finally saw BB and was expecting great things from the reviews it received last summer. While not a bad film, it didn't have that dynamite punch you expect from a film touted as a summer blockbuster. I found the very beginning confusing and it took me 40 minutes in till I started finding it entertaining and not boring. The beginning is from the title, it shows how Bruce Wayne trained to become a deadly fighter with a secret organization. He goes back to Gothem after being gone years to rid the city of crime. Rachel, the girl he had a crush on, is an assistant DA and one of the few that has not been bought by the mob. The movie shows how Bruce developed the bat suit, mobile,and weapons. And of course he must battle the surprise (though he was gone/dead) villains at the end who want to destroy Gotham with a chemical that makes people crazy.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but not that great story you need to be a big hit. Spiderman was much better with how they showed the hero obtaining super hero moves."
tt0137523,"Words like over-rated and pseudo-intellectual come to mind when I look back on this film. Its overblown philosophising was lost on me long before it ended and I was not in the least surprised that its highest popularity in the IMDB ratings comes from males aged under 18. This demographic is of course renowned for its ability to look deeply into and appreciate the philosophical content of movies. This film seems to have developed a cult following but not, I suspect, for reasons its director intended."
tt0102926,"I saw this as an evening movie at a Philadelphia youth hostel years ago. This movie was based on a Thomas Harris novel with the same plot, so we cannot fault the moviemakers too much for the material they had to use.The story is about a rookie female FBI agent who is told by her inept boss to visit Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a murderous psychologist kept in an insane asylum, and get him to somehow explain who has kidnapped several women, including the governor's daughter, with the hope of finding the latter in time. In return, Lecter is to be transferred from the asylum to somewhere more desirable. But Lecter has the rookie tell her about her childhood trauma about lambs being killed before he will talk.In real life, law enforcement agencies do have to rely on criminal informers to get information needed to solve certain crimes. But would they really need to consult an insane psychologist to figure out a criminal mind when they already have their own psychologists and investigators? This might have worked in the nineteenth century when police departments were still underdeveloped, but nowadays this is ridiculous. The creepy atmosphere without the graphic violence still is effective though. Recommended if you don't think too much about this."
tt0372784,"Where to begin? Unbelievably ill-conceived. That's it. A film that tries to be everything to all people, and ends up being nothing as a consequence.An important point to establish up front is that, hysterical claims to the contrary aside, the film is *not* an adaptation of the comic character in any more than the most superficial of ways. The filmmakers simply altered the fundamental elements of the character to far too great a degree. The film, then, must be judged on its merits as a film, not as an adaptation.So how is it as a movie? This one had a lot of potential, and it was hard to watch it fall apart as it went along. Some grumble-inducing moments notwithstanding, it's actually quite good in the early going. It's engaging, well-constructed, and, despite a lot of high-fallutin' monologues about the psychology of fear, never comes across as overly pretentious. The first indication of trouble, however, occurs in this early part of the movie. Bruce Wayne, our future Batman, has been in training with the League of Shadows, a ninja-style group led by Ras al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). Upon his ""graduation,"" Ras explains his master plan. His ""explanation"" is an utterly incoherent rant about ""destroying Gotham,"" Bruce's home city, for no apparent reason other than that it is ""corrupt."" As Watanabe rambled, I started giggling. That the film, in standard Hollywood tell-you-what-you're-supposed-to-think-about-what-you're-seeing fashion, presents this as a very somber, serious moment only added to the joke. Bruce, having listened to this, then turns to Ducard (Liam Neeson), the man who'd recruited him into the League, and asks, totally deadpan, if he really believes in all of this, and my giggles turned into outright laughter, shared by others in the theater. It's an embarrassingly idiotic moment that immediately took me out of the mood that had been established.The film bounces back fairly quickly from this early misstep, though. Back in Gotham, uber-boss Carmine ""The Roman"" Falcone is very well established; he's a guy who runs everything in a corrupt sewer of a city. A scene wherein he threatens to shoot Bruce in a restaurant full of city officials, convincingly explaining that he could do so and get away with it, is certainly a keeper, and promises much more to come. Why the filmmakers bothered spending so much time and energy setting him up is anyone's guess, though, because nothing much ever does. They could have built a movie, or an entire series of movies upon Bruce's efforts to clean up the town, as they'd established it, but, instead, the mighty Falcone is decimated by the Batman in mere minutes, in ludicrously implausible fashion, none of his power helping him a bit. This is to get him quickly out of the way so the movie can radically switch gears, and the new gear it falls into is near-complete idiocy.This gear-switching is so jarring because of the two diametrically opposed--and irreconcilible--directions in which the filmmakers tried to take ""Begins."" The end-product is a cut-and-pasted mess, drawing, almost equally, from great and solidly grounded Batman material, like Frank Miller's ""Batman: Year One"" (which should have been this movie), and very bad, very dated, and embarrassing comic book stuff from yesteryear featuring motiveless, pretentious, overblown, super-villains with some incredibly idiotic (and laughably inefficient) plot to ""destroy"" something. When it kicks into this second phase, every minute of the movie seems to be worse than the one before.The movie essentially disintegrates from the moment Bruce dons the Batman mask. Sitting in the theater, you can almost physically feel the film's IQ drop. Christian Bale, who had done an admirable (if largely unexceptional) Bruce Wayne, never comes close to getting a handle on his characters' alter ego. Indeed, his Batman voice and persona suggest the actor had picked up his direction on how to play the part at the Keanu Reeves School of Acting. When Bruce becomes Batman, all he has to do to rid Gotham of the mighty Falcone is rough up a dozen of his men who are, at that time, in the middle of completing an illegal drug shipment, then attack Falcone and leave him chained and beaten senseless at the scene of the crime. This, we're told, will send Falcone away forever. Uh huh. Then, the filmmakers get to the story they really wanted to tell: Ras al Ghul returns, still looking to ""destroy Gotham"" for no real reason. His means of doing so is the most ludicrous item in a film filled with ludicrous items, and the final hour of the movie is dedicated to a lot of empty standard-issue Hollywood sound and fury, as the plot plays itself out. Unforgivably, the film's last scene is a straight steal of the great ending of Frank Miller's ""Batman: Year One,"" which only serves to rub salt in the wound the film has created by spoiling the scene for some future filmmaker who may one day want to make a real Batman movie.I have no tolerance for this sort of thing anymore. If I hadn't been with a friend, I would probably have left long before it was over In the final analysis, ""Batman Begins"" is inferior, in pretty much every way, to the original Burton flick, and is even less of a Batman movie. For my part, I hope it's going to be ending, rather than beginning, a Batman franchise. I'm rather fond of the character, and have had quite enough of Hollywood dragging him through the mud."
tt0313792,"I'm not a person who expects some sort of masterpiece from Woody Allen every time he makes a movie. If his movies are entertaining, funny and maybe a touch insightful, I'm satisfied. Unfortunately, ANYTHING ELSE is only moderately funny and entertaining. Even more unfortunate, however, is it's total lack of insight.Jason Biggs and Christina Ricci do their best to emulate Allen and Diane Keaton in ANNIE HALL. I know, one does get tired of hearing every Allen movie compared to what is widely considered his masterpiece. But ANYTHING ELSE is so similar in so many ways to ANNIE HALL, it's hard to resist this time. It even uses practically the same finale, with an almost identical punchline.But that isn't the biggest problem with ANYTHING ELSE. That would be Allen's cluelessness as to what twenty-something people talk like in twenty-first century New York.I like to think that there are twenty-one year old people who discuss Jean-Paul Sartre, Billie Holiday and Humphrey Bogart, and I'm sure there are many who go to analysts and have been married and divorced. But I really don't buy that any of them talk the way the characters in this movie talk. Jason Biggs doesn't talk like a young Woody Allen. He talks like Woody Allen. None of the dialog rings the least bit true.It almost seems as though ANYTHING ELSE was an old screenplay that Allen found tucked away somewhere that he dusted off and tried to pass off as a teen comedy by casting young stars. It simply doesn't work. There's not even anything fresh or new here. It's just the same stereotypical Allen intellectualism and philosophy we've seen over and over and over again. That, of course, means there will be a few good lines and few good laughs. But so what? The most forgiving Allen fanatic expects more than that.What Allen needs is a writing partner. He needs someone to take screenplays like this one and give them a contemporary feel. Not simply to attract a contemporary audience, but to make the movie WORK. Woody Allen is one of cinema's greatest artists. But he refuses to evolve as an artist. He's under the delusion that people have the same obsessions and interests that they had thirty years ago. In many ways, they do. In other ways, they don't. And, unfortunately, it's in those other ways that Allen apparently insists on staying."
tt0172495,"One of the best films of a generation, it's a bold claim, but Gladiator truly is that good. Every single element is perfect, the story is phenomenal, one to absorb you for the full running time. The visuals are incredible, an epic masterpiece for the eyes as well as the soul. The acting first rate, surely the aim of any film is to move you, this does just that and then some.The best of Russell Crow are far as I'm concerned, he really does command the screen throughout, Joaquin Phoenix is just as good, it makes me so sad that this was the last film of the late great Oliver Reed, and of course he's awesome.I must also comment on the incredible soundtrack, the sublime music of Has Zimmer coupled with the ancient, enchanting voice of Lisa Gerrard, the music is the same glorious standard as the film, Now we are free still gives me chills, and takes me back to the film.One of my top ten films of all time, a masterpiece, 10/10."
tt1345836,"For a while, I maintained that this was the best of the Dark Knight trilogy. Watching it for the first time in a few years, I can certainly see why. The second half is pure spectacle filmmaking at an epic scale with an extended set piece that feels expansive and alive and huge all at once. However, that first hour or so is much messier, and I think that last half of the film, largely got me to ignore some of the niggling issues that frontend the film.The Batman has been absent from Gotham City for eight years. In that time, Gotham has seen a period of peace and prosperity it has not experienced in a very long time. In order to create that sense of calm, though, Police Commissioner Gordon pumped up the idol of Harvey Dent who had become the psychopathic villain Two-Face, murdered several people, and threatened to kill Gordon's son as the White Knight, blaming all of his crimes on Batman. Together with the Mayor and the City Council, they passed the Dent Act which allowed for aggressive anti-crime actions on the part of the police, resulting in a city without any serious organized crime at all. In this time, Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego, has become a recluse, having spent several post-Batman years and half of his fortune pursuing a fusion reactor before suddenly shutting it down and closing himself off from the world.In enters Bane, a member of the League of Shadows and a former acolyte of Ra's Al Ghul, since excommunicated for his extreme methods. After the death of Ra's Al Ghul, Bane took over the League of Shadows and will continue the man's mission of burning Gotham to the ground, much like the League had done to Rome and London before it. The revolution he ignites is based heavily on the Jacobins of France during the French Revolution, which fits hand in hand with the overall movie's ties to Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities. He speaks of equality, but he rules with an iron fist, establishing a Committee for Public Safety, so to speak, that summarily executes enemies of the revolution. In order to get there, though, Bane must take control of Gotham.Now, the first half of the film is really setup for the giant spectacle that dominates the second half, and some of it is quite good and other elements end up going a bit too far. From beginning to end, I think Bane is great. He's intimidating physically and he ends up with a great plan to acquire wealth and demean Batman at the same time. Stealing his fingerprints through Catwoman/Selina Kyle to fake reckless options trading that wipes out his position in Wayne Enterprises is wonderful. The chase out of the Stock Exchange, giving Bruce Wayne his first moment as Batman in eight years, is exciting and well filmed. That it leaves Wayne so destitute that he can't pay his own power bill is...curious and a step too far. I get the point. The point is to take Wayne as low as possible both as Batman and as Wayne himself, but having his power shut off because of nonpayment roughly a day after his loses all his money feels weird at best and completely ignorant of how things work in the real world at worst.Another very good thing that the first hour does is establish the overall thematic thrust of the film, and that's around pain. Bruce is suffering from a leg injury. That's good. He immediately gets cured well enough to fight as Batman again because of a gadget on his leg. That's...less good. And yet, the idea runs through the rest of it very well. Wayne carries the pain of his loss of Rachel Dawes, from The Dark Knight (to the point that people misinterpret his receding from the world due to that loss, but that's not the case). Gordon carries the pain of having to defend the man who tried to kill his son, while losing that son in a divorce at the same time. The city carries the scars of past trauma brought on by the Joker, but it manages to live on, just as Gordon does. And what do these people do with their pain? Well, more pain must come first.Bane's efforts to take the city end up feeling great. He has an inside man at Wayne Enterprises, also knows that Wayne is Batman because of his connection to the League of Shadows, and he uses the greed of Daggett, a wealthy executive who wants to absorb Wayne Enterprises, to prepare his plan of cutting off the city from the rest of the world. But first, he must take out the Batman. That the ""every police officer"" gets trapped in the sewars is...less good, though. It's another step too far that didn't quite need to be taken. However, this element of the plot is where Selena Kyle is useful.Anne Hathaway as Selena Kyle is really good. She can switch between woundedly scared and feminine to coyly vicious and feminine in an instant. She steals into Wayne Manor as a servant at a party and shows both sides to Bruce as she steals his mother's pearls and his fingerprints, setting up the plot of the film. She's a survivor with a chip on her shoulder, so she's happy to watch as Bruce loses everything as the result of her actions. However she does still have a certain sense of justice so when Bane completely takes over and Gotham descends into a hellscape reminiscent of the French Terror, she's bothered by it, but being a survivor she does little to stop or escape it.The movie turns when Batman has his confrontation with Bane. Evoking the famous comics scenario of Bane breaking Batman's back in the Knightfall run (pretty much the only time I was reading comics, by the way), Bane breaks Batman and sends him to a prison with hope, the worst punishment he can imagine. The visual image of Bruce needing to rise from the pit in order to overcome his pain and fear is great. That it takes him so much effort and that he has to essentially return to an earlier form of himself in order to do it is even better. There's such rich imagery here.The final confrontation between Batman, as a symbol of order, and Bane, as a symbol of chaos and fire, dominates the last half of the movie. The film leaves open some unimportant questions of how Bruce Wayne gets from India to Gotham in about three weeks, but considering the character's history of running in the underworld, including in the Far East, that seems easily filled in by the audience, and once he's there he leads an all out rebellion against the ruling Revolutionary government with an aim towards getting his hands on the nuclear bomb set to go off in twelve hours. Yeah, it's very comic booky, but it's handled with the right balance of seriousness that I think the movie sells the situation well.And in terms of the final act, the spectacle of Batman leading an army in a war against Bane for control of Gotham and against a Jacobin Revolution is great. Batman the symbol leads those who had cowered away in fear to take to the streets, fulfilling the promise of Batman as a symbol established in the first movie (and re-explained to Blake, the cop who has figured out that Wayne is Batman in...another individual step that feels too far in the first half). The evocation of A Tale of Two Cities also helps provide the film a literary understructure that I appreciate. It's not just random bad guys butting up against a protagonist we all know from pop culture. It's a literary extension of the mythos.I feel like this was a bit of a ramble, but I'm gonna stick with it. The Dark Knight Rises is not a perfect movie. Its first half ends up taking a few ideas too far, which undermines them slightly, but not the overall story. What ends up carrying it all, though, is Nolan's sheer command of everything outside the script. Performances are very good. The spectacle is great. The use of image and sound creates a large story that carries interesting ideas about pain and the efforts to deal with it. It's an intelligent and rousing film that could have been a bit tighter, but, by the end, I don't really care that much."
tt1130884,"I was really looking forward so seeing this film after reading reviews etc, and also being a Scorsese fan. After watching the film for 10 minutes i had worked out the ending, i spent the next 2 hours hoping to be proved wrong but unfortunately i wasn't. I cannot tell you how disappointed i was with this film, i know this film is based on a book but it felt to me like a rehash of a few old films eg the twist from sixth sense etc, set in a institution. The only thing that saved me from giving this a lower rating was DiCaprio's performance who at least made it believable, and this is coming from someone who isn't a DiCaprio fan. but when you know the ending the film is spoiled!!"
tt1375666,"All that stuff about sharing dreams makes zero scientific or philosophical sense. And no-one can have dreams with that amount of detail, that many actors, that much lightning fast action, etc, etc. Read Daniel Dennett.There were plenty of stunning special effects and stunts certainly, but I had the feeling throughout that the plot was just a peg to hang these on. If you want to see how to do dreams in cinema, look elsewhere, for example the dream sequence in Wild Strawberries, the Soldier's dreams in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, the whole of Un Chien Andalou. Even Buster Keaton did better than this in Sherlock Junior 80-odd years ago.If you're going to make a film about dreaming, first figure out how to film dreams."
tt0480025,"One of England's most critically successful exports in years arrived in this gritty, lo-fi period drama centering around one very young lad's introduction into his friendly neighborhood skinhead gang in the early 80's. Shane Meadows, coming off the cult success of his brutally simple revenge tale Dead Man's Shoes, attempts a more accessible view here despite his penchant for realism. Boasting an array of strong, authentic performances, Meadows is able to transform viewers back into the writer-director's early upbringing, into the ghettos of Britain with much believability. The filmmaker's personal experience really shows when viewing this excellently-casted group go about their daily routines of mischief and mayhem.This is England works best in small scenes of observational glory, but remains a tad underwhelming thematically for feeling a bit emotionally forced at times. I would have liked to have seen the movie extended a bit more to develop the characters a little better so the questionable climax would not hold as much doubt, but even with all of it's imperfections, This is England is a well made coming of age story told with plenty heart and personality, and marks the complete arrival of Meadows as one of Britain's most important young filmmakers."
tt1130884,"I watched Shutter Island a few hours ago and I'm shocked to imagine that I almost missed it on the theaters. The trailer made it look like a modern horror movie: full of silly jump scenes, dissonant music, grainy cinematography, fast editing. I found the trailer so disgusting to look at, I nearly missed the movie.Well, I'm glad I watched it after all, because I wouldn't hesitate to consider it a modern masterpiece. It's also the best Martin Scorsese movie I've seen by him since Casino.The movie, a mystery set in 1954, follows US Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck, as they arrive at Shutter Island, a desolate place that holds a mental hospital for the criminally insane. Their original mission is to find a patient who disappeared, but Teddy has a secret mission: he believes Shutter Island is keeping sinister secrets, involving experiments on the patients. And he took the mission to get on the island and gather evidence to prove it.To reveal more would spoil the movie.In recent years Martin Scorsese seems to have been making only Oscar bait - his historical epics, Gangs of New York and The Aviator were clear attempts at getting the prized statuette, and it's ironic that it was his least ambitious, more banal movie to date, The Departed, that finally got him an Oscar. But it seems that it released him from this obsession and he has gone back to making great movies without Oscar concerns. Shutter Island is his first movie in a long time to make a good combination of plot and character, and use pacing in an exciting way, drawing the viewer into the story slowly but hypnotically.Leonardo DiCaprio has improved a lot in recent years, taking more interesting projects. In Shutter Island he gives a great performance as Teddy, an ex-soldier who witnessed the liberation of Dachau, haunted by the horrors of the Holocaust, who became a US Marshall only to be hit by a tragedy in his own country. His face and body language, but especially his eyes, transmit the pain of a man who's seen too much and suffered too much and yet continues to cling to life. Although the movie starts as a mystery, it's in fact a character study of Teddy.The supporting cast is just as good: Mark Ruffalo is hit and miss for me, but here he hit it as Teddy's likable partner, Chuck. Ben Kingsley gives a great performance too as Dr. Cawley, a man who radiates nothing but caring for his patients and yet Teddy thinks there's something evil in him. Max Von Sydow, with less screen time than any of the others, is also perfect as a truly sinister doctor.The rest of the movie is in the hands of Scorsese's usual team: Thelma Schoonmaker, Dante Ferretti, Francesca Lo Schiavo and Sandy Powell. I loved the cinematography throughout the movie, every shot was so well framed, so elaborate, the movements so fluid and unusual. I was quite happy to learn it was Robert Richardson (Platoon, JFK, The Aviator) in charge of the cinematography: he's one of the best DPs working in Hollywood nowadays.Another aspect that captured my attention was the music; it seemed so fit for each scene I was amazed to discover none of it had been composed for the movie. I especially loved the use of Max Richter's music in it; he composed one of the best scores I've ever listened to - Waltz With Bashir - and his non-film music can be quite good too. The piece used, On The Nature Of Daylight, was one of my favorite tracks in the movie.Shutter Island is an exciting, tense, and heartbreaking movie. Leonardo DiCaprio made Teddy Daniels such a likable person, the ending might leave some people sad over his fate. It's not death, but this movie shows that there are things worse than death in this world. And perhaps that's the best praise I can give this movie, that it shows new types of horrors we're not accustomed to think about. For that, Martin Scorsese and everyone involved in Shutter Island deserve a lot of praise."
tt0816692,"Let me bring you this in overview.PRO: - Stunning visually, through and through - Good acting by the entire cast - Interesting concept - A strong second half - A somewhat satisfying ending - A few interesting twists - The main musical theme is amazing.CON: - It took too long for anything truly interesting to happen. It had a few good moments, but in general the whole first half of the movie was... a tiny bit boring. If it hadn't been a Nolan movie, I would probably have left in the break. I'm glad I didn't. But the first half makes me not want to see this movie again. - There are really too many plot holes. Or moments that are not well-explained enough for them to be plausible. Things like characters experiencing revelations based on... well, pretty much nothing. Especially near the end. Which doesn't take away from the awesomeness of the second half. But one has to overlook these things to enjoy the story. - Besides the main theme, most of the score seem misplaced. Too loud. Too bombastic. Or not adding to the emotions on screen. And I'm speaking as a huge Hans Zimmer fan here.All in all, I would recommend seeing it. Definitely. But with an expectation that it's not as special as we've come to expect from Nolan."
tt1130884,"This review contains major spoilers. Please do not read any further if you have not yet seen this film and you have any interest in seeing the film at any time in the future.This film makes no damned sense, unless the point of the film is supposed to be that the people running the insane asylum are more insane than the inmates.For this film to make any sense, you have to accept the premise that psychiatrists who actually care about a mentally ill patient would try to cure such patient by doing things that would drive a sane person crazy; that they would play cruel head games that encourage delusional beliefs. How can any sane person believe that giving Teddy/Andrew evidence to support his delusions is going to cure him of delusions? In fact, as the film progresses, we see Teddy/Andrew getting more deluded, more paranoid, more violent. The role-playing is clearly counter-productive.Giving Teddy/Andrew reasons to believe his delusions would not cure him. This is proved by the fact that there are numerous people on the IMDb boards who believe Teddy was sane all along, throughout the film. If the role-playing can't even convince these viewers of the truth, how is it supposed to convince Teddy/Andrew?And for this film to make any sense, you also have to believe that these same doctors would give a startling degree of freedom to one of the asylum's most violent killers. Andrew/Teddy attacks a patient and knocks out a guard. He blows up a car, for goodness sake! That alone should prove it was insane to give him any freedom to wander alone, even for a short time.The movie was set up as a mystery - what is the secret of Shutter Island? But the resolution (that Teddy/Andrew was insane all along, and the doctors were pretending to be evil because they thought that would cure him of his delusions) makes no sense. There is nothing worse than a mystery where the solution breaks all rules of logic. It reminds me of the following joke:Dennis Lehane: What is furry, has four legs, purrs, and reads the newspaper every day? Richard Nathan: I don't know. Dennis Lehane: A cat. I lied about the newspaper.I thought that joke was annoying the first time I heard it, and it's annoying as the basis of the mystery in ""Shutter Island.""Furthermore, the resolution is not the result of any actions taken by the protagonist. The role-playing game doesn't lead Teddy/Andrew to discover the truth himself. He is merely a passive listener as the solution is explained to him. The breaks several major rules of screen writing.And what about the very end? Most people interpret Teddy/Andrew's last line as meaning Andrew is only faking his regression, so that he can get a lobotomy and avoid facing the truth. But if he were faking it, why would he give this away to the doctor playing Chuck? And why are so many people moved by this act of cowardice? Can there be anything more cowardly than someone choosing to get a lobotomy to avoid facing the truth about himself? Are we supposed to empathize with someone who chooses to destroy his own intellect because he doesn't have the guts to face the truth?I cannot understand how anyone can think this is an intelligent screenplay."
tt0108052,This is an awful movie. It has an awful story. It is very slow and boring. It is not fun to watch at all. I do not know why it got an 8.9. Just because people like sad boring movie. I do not like sad boring movie. If I want to be sad and bored I will just live my life. I do not need a movie to remind me how sad and boring life is. This is 4. It is not a 8.9 that is just hype. Do not wast your time. Do not wast your money. Do not see this movie. It a long movie and life is to short. If was a long movie and it was something good to see like Lord of the rings then it would worth the time. This is not. Good actors wasted there time being in this awful movie.
tt0133093,This movie is too amazing. Visual effects is so much impressive. Action sequence is too impressive. Over all experience is great. This movie is watching aging and again.
tt0114369,"I didn't know what I was getting into when I sat down to watch this movie along with my friend. He had brought the DVD to my home and as he is a hardcore fan of Brad Pitt, he has bought almost every major hit movie of Pitt and since I am also a fan, we both watched it together. I thought it would be a cool movie like other Pitt films, but it was so dark and has so much more than other films of this genre.Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is on his last week in duty and he's all set to retire when the case of a strange death is made his responsibility to solve. Though all others think that it was a psycho who was responsible for the death, Somerset has his doubts, he thinks that the murderer is simply a clever and disgusted man who is trying to rid the society of evil. In many ways, his and the killer's view about the degrading society is alike, except that Somerset wants to leave the city for the country life and the killer is taking action. Enter Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), the young and dynamic sleuth who has a positive view on the society, and he is made the partner to Somerset. Then onwards, there are more disgusting, shocking deaths with the seven sins as its identity. The seven sins are - Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Pride, Lust and Wrath. While Mills believes the killer is an insane person, Somerset tells him that he is a very clever, normal man and nowhere near insane with his precise killings and no clues to be found anywhere. The killer is a John Doe (played brilliantly in a cameo role by Kevin Spacey) and it takes every last bit of Somerset's and Mills willpower to not get carried away by the magnitude of the brutal, methodical killings. Tracy Mills (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the wife of Mills and they are very much in love. Will the detectives be able to stop this killer who claims himself to be a servant of God and who will bear the brunt of this maniac's insanity eventually - The society or the detectives?David Fincher is at the helm of this amazing film. This could have been a routine cop-killer story, but he does not even step into the tired and old Hollywood clich√©s and is not afraid to make this a dark, unique and depressing tale about the human life. Also, he does so in a very powerful and clever way. I was racking my brains to figure out who the killer was, as in films like these, they would show the killer beforehand. And in the end, it was true; the killer had come in contact with the detectives. Morgan plays the old and more worldly wise man, rather in contrast to Pitt's character who is a hot-head at times. No matter how insanely talented Pitt is, the press always seems to give more importance to his charming looks and relationship with Jolie (back then, it was Jennifer Aniston). Tracy is genuinely portrayed by Gwyneth Paltrow. She played a major part in bringing Mills and Somerset together. I loved her scene where she introduces each other. Though she didn't get enough screen-time to have satisfied me, I got over it as the ending was so emotional and I cried (I am a straight guy and I am not ashamed to say that I cried) when Pitt finds out what was in the box. I could see that one coming a couple of minutes before the movie got to it, but it doesn't mean I didn't get emotional at that point. I was hoping against hope that it wasn't what I was thinking. But, it was and I cried. Don't see this if you can't handle brutal death scenes (although they show only the aftermath of the death, it is still nauseous) and are easily bored when things are not non-stop action. But, the screenplay is one of the best I have seen in this genre. Also, the colouring layout of the movie is dark, everything is subdued and always raining, except save for the climax which is bright and hot, which served as an irony of sorts and it was wonderful. When John Doe tells Mills to become wrath, I got chills running up and down my spine.I still consider Fight Club to be the best Pitt-Fincher movie, but I can't ignore this brilliantly made movie. Though not everyone will like this film (case-in-point, my Brad Pitt fan friend), because of the dark overtone, I loved it as it isn't flashy and predictable like most movies of this genre, and actually was very brilliant.10/10"
tt0114369,"I was totally taken with this film. It's not The Usual Suspects, but it is really something. Unfortunately, I felt almost sick when I was finished watching it. The madness of the murders and the general philosophical sickness that carries it along put it out of reach for some of us. I can't imagine the world portrayed here. Great cast. I really thing Brad Pitt is excellent; and, of course, Morgan Freeman is his usual complex self. Once again, however, in a relatively brief appearance, Kevin Spacey steals every scene he's in. It's that unflappable delivery of his. No matter what is said or done, he anticipates it. The murders are hideous. The camera doesn't show the most gory details (which I appreciated), but they are sold to us through outside factors. I missed this the first time through and wanted it to be part of my movie-going experience. I don't think I could ever watch it again."
tt0109830,The movie was a great hit and it's not a surprise. Because everything was fine and superb. Once again the acting was so good. Even so we feel that the movie is too slow we realize that it is not boring.
tt0111161,"I liked this film. That sums it up pretty well. This film is good, in some aspects very good, but the best film of all time? I usually don't say this, but I think The Shawshank Redemption is overrated. I don't want to take away from the performances, the story or the score, those were really good. I guess Opinions differ and that's fine. For me personally the fact that I knew that this film was ""the highest rated film of all time"" unfortunately hurt my experience. I was expecting a lot more, which in the end I didn't get.
But still a good watch nonetheless."

tt1375666,"I loved the whole concept and most of the movie. I felt that there was a lot to cover and very little time to do that. It was a bit all over the place. I also think that there were so many subplots and uncovered past events that made this movie confusing. For example, even though I loved Cobbs background with Mal and all that he had learned from it, it was a bit much. I feel like they could have dumbed it down and made it a bit less complex, like for example the presence of the Professor, it made me so confused. Yet, now that I think about it, I really did love that the rest was so complicated: The dreams within the dreams, the way they made Robert Fisher decide to split up the company, the complications that they had because of the heavy sedation, and so much more. I also like the ending, very freaky and just a great end to such a wonderful movie."
tt0114369,"I have never understood why so many people consider this movie a great thriller. It has a few spooky & exciting moments, but overall it is terribly predictable and disappointing. Brad Pitt is insufferable, and the old, wise cop vs. young, arrogant rookie thing has been done to death in better movies than this one. There is little here that is original or creative--it's fine for a rental, but I'm sorry I wasted my money when it was in the theaters."
tt7286456,"I have no idea why this is rated so highly.I think Joaquin is a great actor (U-Turn, Gladiator etc) but this film is cringe worthy to watch.He spends the whole movie laughing this annoying laugh and the movie thinks it's more clever than it actually is."
tt0167260,"I can't believe this movie won so many Oscars. Sure it was technically sound and all but damn was it boring. This is one of the few movies I have been tempted to walk out of. The last movie I walked out of was Spawn if that gives you any idea how little I enjoyed this movie. Its not that I don't have the attention span, some of my favorite movies are ""7 Samurai"" and ""The Great Escape"". I think we have all been brainwashed or maybe just starved for a good fantasy movie to come along.Anyways, for all the technical achievements and production value I give it 6/10.Please don't make ""The Hobbit""."
tt0172495,"Now don't get me wrong, Gladiator is not a bad film, it simply isn't as good as everyone seems to be saying it is.  For some reason it has captured the imagination of what I call the James Bond audience, the people who only go to the movies once or twice a year and this has artificially inflated it's rating. There are plenty of other people writing about how good the film is, so I'm going to concentrate on it's flaws.Firstly, it is far too long.  Clearly the producers wanted to make an epic like in the old days, but they seemed to have assumed that epic means length.  Wrong!  I'm sure a half-decent producer could have taken at least half and hour out of the film.  It takes far too long to get going.  After the inital battle, which for me was the high-point of the film, there is no action for about 45 mins.  This is the point where the plot takes place. The problem is, the characters are all so cardboard that the audience can easily work out what the plot is about, and five minutes here would have been more than ample.The fight scenes were some of the worst I have ever seen.  You would think Ridley Scott (or his second unit director) would have seen The Matrix, a Jackie Chan film, or at least one Martial Arts film.  That is how to direct an interesting fight; long, stationary shots showing off the skills of the stuntmen, not close-ups and constant irritating cutting on movement.  It was impossible to work out what was going on in most of the fight scenes.Thirdly, there is far too much CGI.  Yes it was impressive to recreate the Coliseum, but then they ruin the effect with overkill.  And the CGI tigers were absolutely awful.  Surely real tigers would have been cheaper and far more impressive.Fourthly, historical accuracy...  oh we don't need to bother with this, after all, it's only a movie...And don't forget the wonderful array of accents!I can't help comparing the film to Ben Hur or Spartacus and I'm afraid that Gladiator comes a poor second in terms of story and spectacle."
tt0120737,"I hated frodo, the character, the actor, and almost everything about him, I have watched the hobbit before this, and I loved it, unlike frodo, bilbo was fantastic"
tt0468569,"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"
tt0110912,"Most people I know who have seen this movie either think it's the best movie ever or the worst piece of trash ever produced.  I happen to fall in the middle.  I enjoyed this film, though not immensely.  I found it funny, which actually kind of disturbs me in a way.  Should it be funny when someone accidentally gets blown away? Yet I found it to be.  Still, I think the extreme amount of violence got to me, since it mostly did not have much of a point; it is really only the one scene of violence that I thought was amusing.  I thought the Bruce Willis storyline could have been done without, instead focusing on Travolta and Jackson.  Instead, the ""story"" meanders and seems largely without purpose.  Despite that, though, it was still an enjoyable film.  I recommend it as long as people realise what they're in for, and don't just watch it because of the hype surrounding it; when someone expects perfection and they don't get it, they tend to over-compensate and react more negatively than they otherwise would have, and end up giving this film a 1 instead of the 5 they might have given it had they not been shocked by the content.I give this film a 6.5, mainly for the dark humor.  This movie is not for everyone.  Don't watch this movie with blinders on, and hopefully it will be worth the 2 hours and (possibly) the $3-4 you spent to rent it (although in Canada, I know you can watch an unedited version of it on Showcase- that channel is great for films they can't show on the networks without such severe editing that part of the story is lost).  The other thing I liked about this movie was the characters themselves; Tarantino is very good at taking what would from the outside seem like despicable, inhumane creatures and making them human.  While I don't know how many hitmen are actually nice guys, it is nice to see films sometimes that have normal people doing bad things, instead of just evil, rotten, flat characters.  This film is thus a good character study, for those interested in the workings of the human mind."
tt0120737,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I went to the theater and got excited when I saw the opening sequence. It showed the history o the ring and what it was. They also had a battle that we didnt get to see enough of. Then the pace slows down. NO...IT COMES TO A HALT!!! I looked at m watch every five seconds. This movie is bad. Fans of the book love it but guess what? The book was trash too. Please, if you have three hours of your life to throw away, go and watch men working at a construction site. It is more entertaining then this garbage."
tt1345836,"Nolan's recent blockbusters stand like looming corporate architecture: shining and cerebral; stately and sexless. His scripts are like visitors' guides to these spaces, proudly explaining every detail, surgically removing every doubt. His tell-don't-show insistence is of an artist possessing consummate technical skill and curiosity, but one unwilling to allow his crafted geometric edges to be rounded off with anything approaching satire or self-effacement. Nolan's style is rigorously formal and conservative, eliding evidence of the author in favour of ruthless aesthetic efficiency. Handsome and functional but lacking personality: Apple iPod films.His sort-of-superhero trilogy began with Batman Begins, an elegant, taut, stirring comic book thriller, in which Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) struggled with his entrenched internal fears, and how to externalise them and use them as a weapon. It was followed by The Dark Knight, which had some fantastic scenes, usually involving the Joker, and maintained a convincing sense of dread up to a point. But it was dogged by hyper-plotting, scattergun characterisation and maddening verbosity - and sadly its successor continues and extends these trends.The third film is set eight years after The Dark Knight, and we meet Wayne as a limping recluse, still suffering physically and emotionally from his sacrifice. The first hour is a spaghetti mass of new characters and reintroduced characters and references to characters, but it's pretty much the same plot as Avengers Assemble, with a bad guy (in this case Bane, played by Tom Hardy) threatening to use a powerful yet unstable energy source as a weapon of mass destruction. Bane was ""born in hell on Earth"". He's built like Lord Humungous from Mad Max 2, his gas mask looks like a Predator mouth, and he speaks like Darth Vader. Not nice. Luckily Batman has help from cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), feisty rookie cop Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and the usual wholesome oldies, Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and Alfred (Michael Caine).There's a great central scene in which Batman is lured to Bane's hideout, and the two go head-to-head, elbow-to-elbow. It's the one satisfying action scene in the film. (There's nothing to rival Begins' monorail showdown or The Dark Knight's truck chase.) Bane is still a seething, menacing presence at this point. All physicality: the embodiment of rage and fearlessness. But soon after he starts speaking at length, and his voice rises and his mystery evaporates, and he becomes just a man, much less than the horrible primeval idea he'd been before. If anyone could have done with a media spokesperson, it's Bane.The film then enters zeitgeist territory, with Bane's army tearing down Wall Street (or whatever the Gotham equivalent might be), nullifying the police presence, and staging the ultimate Occupy protest, while the meek Gotham citizens cower indoors. By this point serious questions about plot logic and group dynamics emerge - a lot of ""How did he end up there?"" and ""Why don't they just...?"" type enquiries. This is what happens when writers follow every digression their story allows.The Dark Knight Rises isn't a terrible film, but at nearly three hours the content must more compelling than this. I don't mind its neo- conservative messages; the worship of the feted elite is not new to the superhero canon. I can cope with the portentousness. Even Christian Bale's funny Batman voice doesn't bother me. These are all matters of taste. But if we're expected to take this stuff seriously then excessively exposition-heavy screen writing, narrative over-complexity in lieu of profundity, plot chasms, extraneous characterisation, and editorial indiscipline are inexcusable.Remove the cumbersome political overtones and you're left with something disappointingly generic: a doubtful hero (with attachment issues, of course) facing up to a brutish nemesis, a city in peril, and an explosive showdown. So you might as well watch Avengers Assemble again."
tt1375666,"I have to say to make such an impressive trailer and such an uninteresting film, takes some doing.Here you have most of the elements that would make a very good film. You have great special effects, a sci-fi conundrum, beautiful visuals and good sound. Yet the most important part of the film is missing. There is no plot, character or soul to this film. It's like having a beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside.It's an empty shell of a film. There is no tension; you couldn't care less about any of the characters, why were they even motivated to do what they did. Helping a corporation get ""one over"" on another corporation is hardly saving the human race.When you operate in a dream environment, where you can't die or be injured really it means there is nothing to worry about, who cares what happens. All the explosions and actions sequences are just meaningless. By the way, why does Hollywood still keep filming action scene's an inch away from every characters nose? It's impossible to see what's going on, so many films are ruined by this. Watch and learn from the Matrix, take the camera backwards a couple of feet and we can actually work out what's going on.So 2 and half hours of looking at my watch waiting for the very predictable ending, is a million miles from being a good film. How anyone in their right mind can give this 10/10, it's boring and pointless. A film has stir the soul, has to grab you, you need to feel for the characters. Can anyone, honestly say, they cared about anyone on show here.By the way, here's an idea, why don't you bring the children (who haven't aged a minutes since you last saw them) to you, if you can't go to the US.I know the end scene was trying to be ambiguous, but the fact his father, who lives in Paris, is bizarrely there in the US to meet him (how did he know) and the children look identical to every dream sequence they appeared in, means there wasn't much doubt.In the end there is nothing at stake for anyone, so a pointless movie. I suspect Nolan will continue to get praise, but I can't really say I've got excited about any of his movies. They all leave me cold. They are not terrible, just there's nothing really there, no substance."
tt0372784,"'Batman Begins' should have been one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen¬Ö only I didn't have that many expectations to begin with. However, it managed to leave me mad. As I write this review, I've just come out from watching 'Sin City,' and in this Roberto Rodriguez movie you have everything that Christopher Nolan's movie tried to get right but failed miserably! What especially bothers me about 'Batman Begins' is its pretentiousness! It's because it perverts a movie's nature trying to make it be something it cannot be; it's pretentious because, for all the acclaim Nolan got with 'Memento,' he's not an artistic director with indie sensibilities; and it's pretentious because it's no more than a summer action blockbuster pretending to be an artistic movie! But neither Nolan has the intellect to pull off a truly artistic ambition nor can anyone make an artistic movie out of $150m budget. It cannot happen because no Hollywood studio that puts up so much money will ever allow it. So Nolan can fool how many people he wants with this ordinary action movie, this is not the great masterpiece being hyped on the internet and through word of mouth.It's no better than the 'Spiderman' and 'X-men' franchises: they in fact invented the formula and gave a better use; we're finally living in an era where superhero movies are being taken seriously and given the 'realistic' treatment. 'Batman Begins' tries to be painfully realistic and horribly fails ¬ó first of all, because at the end of the day it will still be about a man that dresses up like a bat; and because, unlike 'X-Men' and 'Spiderman,' its realistic moments are boring and messy. The ridiculous beginning with Bruce Wayne in a prison somewhere in Asia is just ridiculous. Starting the movie with dialog like 'I'm your demon,' 'no, you're practice' immediately destroyed my hopes. It then moves to a strange, gratuitous brawl.But let's start with the fine points ¬ó I must admit there are some. First of all, I enjoyed several of the flashback scenes predating Bruce's self-exile from Gotham City. The scenes with young Bruce playing in the garden with Rachel; his failed attempt to kill Joe Chill; his conversation with Carmine Falcone at the restaurant ¬ó those were all very good. And Christian Bale was very good in all his Bruce Wayne scenes. In fact, acting is something I can't complain about in this movie: Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, tom Wilkinson and Liam Neeson were all very good. Of course Gary Oldman was better than anyone else, but he's Gary Oldman: really, his performance as Jim Gordon was just superb. However, as good as actors they may be, they're still only playing mediocre, one-dimensional characters. Bale even got the chance to play two one-dimensional characters in a single movie! Now Katie Holmes and Cillian Murphy ¬ó whom everyone is over-praising ¬ó were just plain dull! And this is where all the problems with the movie begin. Starting with Liam Neeson's character, the villain Ra's Al Ghul is just one clich√© after another. Every line he utters is full of pseudo-philosophical pearls of wisdom. It's like he never stopped being a Jedi ¬ñ 'you must face your fears,' 'you've traveled all over the world but now you must travel inwards,' 'will is everything.' Honestly, with corny dialog like this, what claim does anyone have to complain about 'Revenge Of The Sith.' I didn't feel as embarrassed watching Lucas' movie as I did watching Nolan's.I won't even discuss the ridiculous plot. Now I'd discuss the action, only I couldn't make out anything of it, being so dark, fast-paced and full of close-ups. In an action movie not even the action they got right!? Gotham City is a city we've seen countless times in cinema over the past 23 years. It's basically 'Blade Runner' without the rain and Asians. I saw Gotham City a few years ago in 'The Matrix,' and before that in 'The Crow,' also in 'Dark City' and more recently 'Minority Report.' However I haven't seen a distinctive aesthetic like the one Tim Burton envisioned for his Gotham City lately. That was a unique vision, Nolan's is just derivative trash. Even the Batmobile is an ugly piece of metal. In its attempt to conform to the hyper-aggressive trend in modern superhero movies, we get a ridiculous tank with three wheels capable of silly stunts.I can't expect this to be worse than 'Fantastic Four,' but then that's another movie I'm not getting my hopes high for. In the end, 'Batman Begins' is just a big disappointing pseudo-artistic action flick: it'll disappoint anyone who wants action; it'll disappoint anyone who believed the hype about the complex characters and great dialog ¬ó people like me ¬ó and it'll disappoint people who are bothered to deconstruct this piece of trash and see it for the sub par movie it really is."
tt0111161,"Frank Darabont directed this superb adaptation of the Stephen King novella that stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a young banker who was wrongfully convicted for the murders of his wife and her boyfriend. Upon arrival at Shawshank prison in Maine, he keeps to himself mostly, causing no trouble, though does befriend long-time inmate ""Red' Redding(played by Morgan Freeman) who teaches him the ropes of prison life, though the unwanted attentions of degenerate inmates pushes poor Andy to the edge of despair, until his financial skills as a banker prove most useful to both the corrupt Captain of the guards(played by Clancy Brown) and corrupt warden(played by Bob Gunton) until Andy hits upon a most clever escape plan... Now legendary film that sits atop the IMDb best film list is indeed a worthy film(though not my pick!) Still, done with remarkable skill on every filmmaking level. Could be viewed as an allegory of Christianity, but is indeed an uplifting story of friendship and the human spirit. Supporting characters(except for the one played by James Whitmore) aren't that appealing, but aren't intended to be either! Perfect ending as well."
tt0068646,"Before 'The Godfather' came out in 1972, the gangster genre, chiefly associated with Jimmy Cagney and the film noir style of the forties and fifties, had been in something of a decline. It was, therefore, a brave move for Francis Ford Coppola to attempt a three-hour epic based upon the family life of a Mafia don.The film opens in the immediate post-war period with the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone. Scenes of the wedding are intercut with scenes showing Don Vito himself in his study, granting favours and dispensing a crude form of justice as though he were an absolute monarch. We soon learn, however, that times are changing, even in the world of organised crime. Don Vito's empire has been based upon gambling, illicit liquor sales and prostitution. Other Mafia families, however, are eager for the profits to be made from drugs, and Corleone receives a proposal from a drug dealer named Sollozzo that the Corleone clan should join him in exploiting the narcotics market. Corleone refuses, ostensibly for business reasons, but it is made clear that his real objections to narcotics derive from his personal code of honour. Sollozzo, offended, orders an attempt to be made on Corleone's life. This fails, but Corleone is left seriously injured.The focus now shifts to the younger generation. Don Vito has three sons, Santino ('Sonny'), Fredo and Michael, and an adopted son, Tom Hagen. These four have contrasting characters. Sonny is hot-headed and impetuous, Fredo weak, Tom cautious and moderate. Michael, the youngest, loves his family, but initially wants to play no part in their criminal enterprises. Recently returned from the war, his ambitions are to qualify as a lawyer and to settle down in a respectable life with his Anglo-Saxon wife-to-be, Kay. The attempt on his father's life, however, persuades Michael that his first loyalty is to the family, and he agrees to be part of a revenge attack on Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey the corrupt policeman who is on his payroll. There follows a brutal cycle of revenge, as each killing is avenged by another murder.The film's emphasis on family ties, honour and vengeance recall the revengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre. Coppola does seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur. Don Vito, the ageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear, Michael, a good man corrupted by power, of Macbeth (a comparison which will become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy). There is also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge their father. Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high order if it is to seem credible, but Coppola was able to draw upon some of the best performances of the seventies. To my mind, this was Marlon Brando's last great role (I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now' and loathed 'Last Tango in Paris'), but it was one that he made the most of. His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable, part dictator and part lonely old man. His rasping voice (the result of an earlier bullet wound in the throat) conveys both menace and physical weakness. Don Vito may be a bad man, but he is also in a way a magnificent one, and his passing marks the end of an era.If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando, it also saw the birth of a new star. Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II', I have never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here, as he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' (as his brother calls him) to a warlord, from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless killer. Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen, I am surprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor. It would be interesting to speculate who might have won if he and Brando had been in competition for the award. I am even more surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor; Joel Grey's role in 'Cabaret' (which did win) is more showy and a technical tour de force, but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's performance. I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hot-headed Sonny.This is not a perfect film; it has flaws, both artistic and ethical. Artistically, there are places where it tends to drag, particularly after the killings of Sollozzo and McCluskey, and even more so after the killing of Sonny, although it recovers at the ending, which is a highly effective piece of cinema.Ethically, I felt that the film tended to take the characters' world view too much at face value. Don Vito may be a dictator, but he is in his own eyes a benevolent dictator, a man of honour who lives by his own moral code. As others such as Roger Ebert have pointed out, this is a film which views a closed society from the inside; the only outsider is Kay, and her role is a relatively minor one. As a result, we do not get to see the damage that organised crime does to the fabric of society, and the Mafia's own view of itself is never openly challenged. That is not to say, however, that the film is totally amoral. We do see that an ethos of taking revenge can spiral out of control and lead to unforeseen consequences, to the innocent as well as the guilty. This is particularly true of the scenes where Michael takes refuge in Sicily after killing Sollozzo. The dead man's associates track him down, and a bomb meant for him instead kills his innocent young Italian wife Apollonia.Although there may be no overt condemnation of the moral position of the Mafia, there is implied criticism of its bloodier deeds. All the characters, whatever the crimes of which they may be guilty, are careful to pay lip-service to the Catholic Church and its rituals. Throughout the film (indeed, throughout the trilogy as a whole) the traditional ceremonies of the Church form a backdrop to various criminal activities. ('The Godfather' begins with a wedding and ends with a baptism). It seemed to me that Coppola was using these scenes to make an ironic contrast between the values of organised crime and those of Christianity, especially at the end of the film. Michael, already a 'godfather' in the metaphorical sense of a Mafia boss, becomes one in the literal sense of a baptismal sponsor. Shots of him taking vows on behalf of his godchild to reject the works of the devil are intercut with shots of his enemies being gunned down on his orders.Despite my reservations about this film, and although I personally would not have ranked it as my all-time favourite, there can be no denying that it is a film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema. 8/10"
tt1853728,"You leave the theater with the only possible conclusion you were supposed to get: white people are bad, and they need to pay for that fact. It was a tour de force of violence and the n-word, and although the story was generally good and believable, and the actors were solid, I just felt like I had been beaten over the head with pure negative propaganda by the time it was over. Too bad. I like most of his work, and Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill are among my favorite films."
tt0372784,"Nobody doubt that Nolan's trilogy is, so far, the best option for those who want to watch some Batman movie and i totally agree with that. ""Batman Begins"" starts it really well, it is a great super hero movie, very realistic and dark, with a incredible well developed story (for a super hero movie, at least).
But it's not perfect.-Why do you think so? - you ask meI just don't see Christian Bale as a good Bruce Wayne, i mean, i think he doesn't inpire that strong personality we expect coming from Bruce Wayne.Another thing that i really disliked about that movie, is how they made Scarecrow look like just an ordinary vilain. I mean, the whole plot is about destroying Gotham through fear, and Scarecrow is the face of fear itself in Batman universe, but here, as i already said, he was just an ordinary vilain, who was defeated by an ordinary taser (???????) and was just working for Ra's Ghul, who was the real vilain of the movie.Despite of that, i really enjoyed the movie, and think it was a great start. 8/10"
tt1375666,"Genius from start to finish. Unbelievable. I've been a fan of Christopher Nolan since Memento, but this takes his immense talents to the next level. I wouldn't trust this film in the hands of any other filmmaker. Truly."
tt0137523,"This film is irrefutably bright and creative in its adressing of consumerism and attempting to find a meaningful exstance in a sleepwalking world. The protagonists are easy to identify with, at least in concept, as they search for sensation in their boring lives. This identification immediately helps draw the audience in, and keeps us there with flashy fist fights and emotionally packed dramatic scenes. The pacing and editing of the scenes that are meant to feel like a music video hit the mark with precision, and the violence, which could feel over the top and unnecessary, becomes a simple means to an end, as we embrace the events in time to the audio. The whole movie is melodramatic and unnecessarily high strung, but given that the acting is well done, and the subject matter is somewhat commentary on society, it works to convey the intended message."
tt0372784,"Okay, i don't know how this movie got such good reviews i don't get it. First the fighting scenes are annoying because the camera moves too much and you can barely see what they' re doing. Second for GOD SAKE this tow words "" FEAR "" and "" AFRAID "" are almost half of the script , no kidding they say those words more than 50 times on the movie it is really annoying !!!! Oh and do not forget those movement of batman, he basically have the same powers than superman, there are some scenes where he is flying , you don't see him using his stuffs. Katie Holmes had a good acting , even if in half of the time you see her she is like crying or about to. Besides those things the movie has a good story , and the guy that did Batman did good , even if i don't see him as a batman his acting was good. Oh and one more thing God! did you noticed how his voiced changed when he was batman and when he was Bruce when he is batman he has a deep scaring voice and when he is Bruce he has a normal kinda of gay voice. That doesn't really fit"
tt0177344,"Comedy, musical. The picture, shot in the middle of the Great Patriotic War in the Kazakh SSR according to the script of Evgeny Petrov. Yes, the same Evgeny Petrov, who together with Ilya Ilf wrote the famous and super-popular novels ""Twelve Chairs"" and ""The Golden Calf"". Unfortunately, Evgeny Petrov himself did not live to see the premiere, because his plane was shot down by a fascist fighter. So, this masterpiece was sincerely advised to me by a person who knows Soviet cinema, for which I am categorically grateful to him. And here's my brief opinion for you - The unequal love of a solid pilot and a young artist. I must say right away that there are no minuses in the picture, because we do not consider the rather primitive technologies of the thirties and forties, toy planes, obvious combined filming for this. After all, scolding for such an old movie is at least strange, and in general it gives off a bad tone. Therefore, I will focus your attention on the advantages of this masterpiece of Russian cinema.So, here they are:
1. Scenario - the action of the picture unfolds before and in the first months of the Great Patriotic War and tells the story of dating, trials and finally love of a pilot at the age of Ivan Baranov (a real ace in his field) and a young artist Natasha Kulikova, who is beginning her creative career. We will be shown all the vicissitudes of their love against the background of the history of a Great country at that time. But there were a lot of tests. And although I personally have a negative attitude to unequal marriages, but at the same time I admit that there are exceptions among them, and this masterpiece clearly shows this. The characters evoke sympathy, the dialogues are written by a master of his craft. It literally feels like real people are talking, not dummies. Minor characters are marked with broad strokes so as to give the viewer a visual idea of them, without wasting precious film on individual scenes with them (which modern Russian directors and screenwriters should learn!). It is pleasant and interesting to watch the romantic line. The final is certainly predictable, but the main message in the final is very vital and has not lost relevance even in our time. Once again, my respects to Evgeny Petrov!2. Humor - this picture is primarily a comedy, so the viewer will be amused here. Which she successfully does. Funny situations, small and not very dirty tricks, sometimes an open ""kindergarten"", but all this is very subtle, dosed and most importantly funny. No one has any ""crown"" phrases here, but still the picture will make you laugh, although do not count on wild laughter, because this picture is from the forties, and some moments the modern viewer may simply not understand, because during this time life itself has changed.3. Songs - they sing here, and quite often, but a jamb came out due to the sound twisted to the maximum at these moments, which is why it is very, very difficult to understand the words of the songs, which is very frustrating. Mostly they sing Russian folk songs in opera treatment, which is a bit unusual for modern audiences, but then it was common. In general, there is something to listen to!4. Warmth - the picture literally plays with all the colors of the rainbow (despite the fact that it was shot on black and white film). She glows with the warmth and love of the creators for her creation. And I wouldn't be surprised if it was shown to soldiers and officers of the Red Army at the front, because there is enough patriotism in the picture. And not a poster, but a simple, human one. Faith in yourself, faith in your love, faith in your people, faith in your country, faith in victory, which is sure to be (and was). After viewing, there were only pleasant impressions, despite the primitive technologies and toy planes, again, I repeat. But the picture was shot in difficult years and in difficult conditions, but at the same time they managed to shoot the most real masterpieces. That's it!A little about the main characters:
1. Ivan Baranov, performed by Mikhail Zharov, is an experienced pilot of civil aviation of the USSR, who, while performing another flight, notices a pretty young artist, and inadvertently speaks a bad word about her. He doesn't know yet that this will be the beginning of a great feeling. An honest hero, ready to do the impossible for the sake of a loved one, whose role was superbly played by the wonderful artist Mikhail Ivanovich Zharov. Bravo!2. Natasha Kulikova performed by Lyudmila Tselikovskaya is a young artist who has a great future ahead of her, because she also has talent. Imprudently falls in love with the pilot Baranov, which some people from her entourage do not like. The beautiful Lyudmila was no less convincing in her role than Zharov, so I can only praise and kiss the pen!3. Ananiy Svetlovidov, performed by Grigory Shpigel, is a capricious artist from Natasha's troupe, to whom he breathes unevenly. He tries in every possible way to upset the love of Natasha and Ivan, although not always by his own will. A talented artist, although not very much as a person, whose role was perfectly performed by Grigory Spiegel. Bravo!Once again I am convinced that Soviet cinema is the best and most unique event in the history of the entire industry, which is still worthy of viewing and which all directors of the world should be equal to (and not deny their past and spit on their ancestors, as modern Russian directors do).As a result, we have a great comedy about unequal love, with a great script, great dialogues, good musical numbers, great humor, and great acting!My rating is 10 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!"
tt0468569,If I'd been sitting at the end of a row in the cinema I would have left after 30 minutes. I've sat through enough hard hitting films to know the difference between meaningful grit and wanton hatefulness. The production values in this film are so high that the 'terror' that is deliberately laid down seems genuinely possible in its evilness. The killings and explosions however do not support the supposedly 'psychological' subtext. Two men sitting either side of the same coin...or as Gotham DA's coin shows....both the same side... is not adequately developed. The story's many conflagrations and large set piece explosions cannot possibly have been set up by one man (The Joker) in any reasonable timescale - and certainly not in the one suggested in the film. The whole thing is just preposterous - it is just an exercise in slash and burn without relief. I had one hell of a headache after seeing this film - I can't have been the only one. One other patron I heard afterwards was positively spitting with rage and contempt over being made to see a film about 'some psychopathic sociopath not Batman'. Heath Ledger evidently had to do himself in in order to kill off the blasted character seeing as Batman wasn't going to.
tt0133093,"I see that on this site only the positive reviews for this film are promoted to be on the first pages, which is at least one-sided if not preferential. This makes me think I won't even get read by other users yet alone supported by them (since they all find this movie awesome)... but whatever let me tell you what I think about this movie:The Story: Is probably the most important part of this movie and simultaneously the one which this movie gets so awfully wrong.1. The concept of machines imprisoning humans was exploited so many times by so many TV Shows (Stargate SG-1 for example had a similar concept driven episode) and movies (Dark City), so I expected this movie to go deep into why would machines imprison humans and have authenticity in its core. I got 0 of that, in fact what did I got? Some stupid explanation saying the machines imprisoned humans because humans loose energy as heat through their skin. OK, it might seem plausible at first sight, but if you know a little about human or about chemistry you will find this concept ridiculous and impossible. Humans lose through heat about 30% of the energy they consume. So that would mean the machines would have to supply the humans with so much energy and then consume the 30% they lose through heat (basically 100% energy used to keep humans alive to 30% energy remained for machines. That means the machines would lose about 70% of the energy they have or invest into sustaining humans alive) why? Because the script says so. If they have that much energy to sustain humans and their necessities for so long why not kill the humans and stick to maybe consume lightning energy which this movie shows to be very satisfying.2. The explanations Morpheus gives Neo are so thin, maybe thinner than a balloon inflated to its maximum. The Matrix was weaker at the beginning so that they escaped? Why hasn't anyone else escaped? How was the Matrix weaker? Does this movie or the next one in the trilogy explain this? No... But yeah because there's a bad-ass character saying these we all should believe this and then say that this movie is a benchmark for all sci-fi to come? I cannot believe that I'm living on this planet where people are fooled so easily by ridiculous explanations that are so thin and they think that they are smart by watching these kind of movies. Oh, but there's more... when other directors come up with a movie thought over 15 years (Inception) and so authentic and realistically executed that starts from correct premises and then exaggerates like any other movie, people make reviews like: ""Overrated because it makes people ""feel"" smart..."". It's incredible that a director that has been making movies since 7 years old and thinks so much about its movies is repaid with bad reviews from people who clearly didn't understood the movie and don't care about dreams, while this movie gets so much praise for having an incorrect premise that just becomes worse as the movie progresses.3. There's no plot twist that can make you say: Yes this movie was thought from start to finish. This movie is just a bunch of action scenes mixed with some poorly explained concepts that have an incorrect scientifically premise and has just enough of all of them to fool the average audiences.The Action: The only part in which this movie succeeded was the action which indeed revolutionized the action flicks back then. Along with the CGI this makes the movie watchable at best (for me at least). But here there are some unexplained things like why if you kiss a person connected to the matrix that person revives and more... becomes even more powerful. It's like a children's movie where the handsome prince kisses the princes or vice versa and she/he wakes up and then they live happily ever after. I expected much more from a movie praised by so many people, but I got 0 explanation for how Neo revives from Trinity's kiss.The Characters: Bland and boring... and so cold especially Morpheus, who was made like this maybe to make him appear more bad-ass. Neo's character is childish for a movie of this magnitude. The chemistry between him and Trinty is not convincing for me. I mean, for the duration of the whole movie she's just kicking ass like Neo, and then they suddenly are lovers... but their relationship has no development because the script is so poor in substance and creates no circumstance in which these characters might interact with each other beside kicking ass and saying one-liners.The Soundtrack: (gotta hurry, word limit) The most bland soundtrack I've heard in my life. For how this movie is promoted as being one of the best ever... I expected a soundtrack that could match this reputation. Actually if you search Don Davis, this composer is known only for Matrix and maybe Jurassic Park III but aside from that, he was never nominated for golden globe, bafta or Oscar (not to say that those matter but other great composers were nominated at least 10 times to Oscars or baftas). There was not a single iconic track in this movie and the score as a whole is just forgettable and underwhelmed.Hope I could include everything I wanted to say in this review. I probably won't get any support for this review, because every person on this planet adores this movie and IMDb supports only good reviews for this movie. And as to why I rate this movie with 5 is because of the CGI and action scenes, because the rest: premise, story, substance or authenticity of the script are either missing or are so thin as a inflated balloon (oh, wait the rating of this movie is as inflated as a inflated balloon... inflated by average people who like only mindless or pseudo-intelligent action)."
tt0139414,"I loved this dopey movie. Funny,with an absolutely hilarious performance by Betty White, an appealing Bridget Fonda (for the first time in memory), and very likeable Brendan Gleeson and Oliver Platt. Bill Pullman was fine but the least of it. What's not to like? I mean, who wouldn't want to save an alligator that's biting people in half in an unspoiled lake 25 miles from anywhere in the middle of Maine? There are so many BAD time wasting movies out there, so much violent, or inane, or vulgar, or sadistic junk that this tongue-in-cheek tale with its dotty characters and clever ending just has to be viewed as one of those times to sit back and smile broadly without guilt. This is hard to pull off, and not to be minimized."
tt0468569,"I don't understand the big deal over the Dark Knight. Sure its OK and the actors are OK and all but its not GREAT. I believe that the movie wasn't all that great and was way to boring. My opinion is the movie is O.K. The atmosphere was the main theme of the movie, it was meant to shock us, gore us out and make us feel sympathy. It dragged on to long and by the end i was half asleep and was glad it was over. As soon as it started I was excited to be watching and by the end i was waiting for it to finish. Most of the actors irritated me. I laughed when the love interest died. She annoyed me.But the movie wasn't horrible. Im not saying its the worst movie I've ever seen - but its not one of the greatest. It definitely has no right to be up there with the greatest. No moment in this movie made me stop and think - wow this is good. If you like action you may like this movie but if you like non-stop excitement you won't.Sure there will be people out there who think that this movie is a masterpiece and there will be people out there that don't like it like myself. But I don't believe such a movie has the right to be called one of the greatest movies of the year, or of all time."
tt0372784,"BATMAN BEGINS lives up to what I heard about it being a ""darker"" version, with much less reliance on flippant one-liners or gags, the result being a more realistic feel for what might have been.From the very start, there is a nice chemistry between Alfred, the butler (superbly played by Michael Caine) and Bruce Wayne (excellent job by Christian Bale). The humor is of the gentle kind, almost subtle in its implications, and it sets the stage for the more realistic flow of events to follow. There's a pulsating background score by Hans Zimmer and John Newton Howard that races along with the film, punctuating it in just the right places, at just the right moments, to give a vigorous punch to the action scenes. And there are plenty of them.But the quieter moments are all extremely well played and given depth by real characterizations--not just cartoonish figures. There is depth in all of the performances with the possible exception of Katie Holmes, an actress who speaks in a voice barely above a whisper and fails to project the belief that she is an assistant district attorney. Miss Holmes needs lessons in projecting her voice.Looming over the landscape is Liam Neeson, a distinguished actor who excels in his carefully concealed villainy. He is a force to be reckoned with and displays all of his versatility here. Equally effective in lesser roles are Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer as the Board Chairman that Bruce Wayne ultimately replaces, and Gary Oldman.The story is forcefully presented with magnificent visuals and eye-popping sets that all have a realistic gleam and are yet stylized enough to give credence to the fact that this is all based on a comic strip character.I can't praise Christian Bale enough as the man who dons that mask. He has all the strength and wily intelligence behind his serious good looks and makes the perfect embodiment of the action hero he is portraying. Firm of jaw, direct of gaze, he makes an excellent hero.Praise too for Cillian Murphy, who makes the most of his Scarecrow role behind a mask of creepy blandness, underplaying his role (as most of the others do) so as not to become a caricature, as so often happens in these Batman enterprises. If it's a series of running gags that you expect--as from previous Batmans--you won't find them here. The thrills come one after another, set pieces that are astounding to watch.Well worth the wait. Christopher Nolan has done an excellent job of handling his subject matter with great skill and flourish.Warning note: Perhaps a little too intense for children, but adults are certainly going to appreciate the fact that the real Batman has arrived."
tt0109842,"Want to watch a young boy in the projects, mess up his life and the lives of those around him? Well, do I have the movie for you! The spends about 5 minutes on the subject of Chess, and the rest of the 100minutes on people and things dying because of this boy's stupid moves. There's few things that irritate me more in movies than characters making illogical choices... but I guess the biggest illogical choice made in this whole scenario was ME, actually deciding to watch this movie. When the credits rolled, I was no smarter than I was before I watched the movie AND I resented the little boy too. So no, I wouldn't recommend that you watch the movie."
tt0361748,"Too many morons will believe this is a factual film and those idiots will pass it on as such. It is an insult to the veterans of WWII, and an insult to the intelligence of film goers. The trailer for the film is a piece of misleading garbage that has little to do with the film, and the group portrayed in the trailer should have been called ""The Inglourious Idiots"". Added to all the above is the fact that too many Hollywood drug addicts think that having most of the film in a foreign language makes it a better film. That just proves that much of the Hollywood crowd is a bunch of snobbish, self-important, elitist, and truly uncreative a**es that do not know how to make a good film. I have never been more disappointed in a film.The high point of the movie is Brad Pitt (Angelina Jolie's live-in). His pitiful imitation of the Billy Bob Thornton (One of Angelina's many former squeezes)character in ""Slingblade"" was hilarious. The attempt to copy Billy Bob is soooooo bad that Pitt should be at the top of the list for that ""Rotten Tomato"" award..Sheesh, when will film makers try to actually make a good film again. Of the last 100 I've watched, there have been two I'd like to see again. This one is 101 on the list..."
tt0133093,"What is THE MATRIX? Well, let me tell you: it's a crowd-pleasing science fiction adventure, which took audiences by surprise as it came out of nowhere and totally destroyed the year's other big sci-fi epic, THE PHANTOM MENACE. The reason for its success is quite obvious when you look at it. The film isn't just about special effects, although they do play a big part; it also has a rather complex and classic sci-fi set up. While STAR WARS was all bad special effects and little else, THE MATRIX is all good special effects and a lot more besides.Okay, so there are some obvious flaws: a lack of originality for one; the real futuristic world looks like something out of BLADE RUNNER and there are bits out of DARK CITY thrown in too. The story, too, once it has been set up, is dropped in favour of some increasingly outlandish action sequences. But when these action scenes are fantastic, then you just don't care. After all, I watch a film to be entertained, and fighting and explosions are the simplest source of entertainment around.The actors and actresses in the film are all okay, although you have to wonder if Carrie-Anne Moss was picked simply because she looks good in PVC. No matter, as it's left to Keanu Reeves in his best role for some time, to carry the film. While he may not be much of an actor (the sheer awfulness of his performance in BRAM STOKER'S Dracula is hard to forget), he just about manages to make his role as a mild-mannered computer operator who becomes a heroic saviour believable. Thankfully, there is some heavyweight support from Laurence Fishburne as the imposing leader of the rebels, and a wonderfully villainous performance from Hugo Weaving as the slimy villain. The costumes are great too - stylish leather and sunglasses making up the main attire.The film is not really about acting, though, or story. It's the special effects which make this, well, special. Without them, it would just be another average tale, but these CGI effects are truly outstanding, even on the small screen. For once, they do fit into the context of the story as well, as they are computer effects in a computer generated world. THE MATRIX has brilliant CGI, and has to join the ranks of TERMINATOR 2, JURASSIC PARK, and INDEPENDENCE DAY as a film which really sets the ever-changing standard on which all other films are to be based.Bullets fly in slow-motion, leaving trails in the air; characters can spin in the air, climb walls and jump huge distances; computer-generated villains morph into other people at will, fights are impossibly fast. Indeed, it is the fight scenes which are the most memorable, as they come across as a hybrid of the classic kung fu genre and the very best of style master John Woo. The best moments are the Fishburne/Reeves training fight, the moment where Reeves takes on Agent Smith in a subway, and the lobby shootout where plaster literally flies everywhere. You also have to love the ending, where Reeves finally wins over the baddies and manages to stop bullets mid-flight with his bare hand. A great image, just one of loads in this great film which has to be one of my favourite sci-fi films of the decade."
tt1853728,"Frankly, this was a really boring movie with too much unnecessary violence. But since the director is Tarantino, criticizing this movie is some sort of taboo. If you have seen some of Tarantino's work, there is nothing new in this one. Blood, violence, boring conversations and a story that has nothing special. Heads explode, bodies tear apart and people dies. That is the one sentence summary. I am not even mentioning the references that would be counted as racist. Moral of the story, this movie is not my cup of tea. Neither the action justifies itself for such a long period of time nor the story is interesting enough to compensate for the violence which was totally unnecessary."
tt0111161,"i had to comment, i really did, all those eulogies on what is in reality a hackneyed complacent pretentious film. Nothing that this film says challenges any principle or thought- its purpose is to confirm every conservative, sentimental, instinct in us all. And yet it has a sense of its own putative profundities, and bulldozes these throughout the film. Really what the film is saying is neither profound nor original, and is not to my mind worth saying in the first place at least not at such length- ie life is hard, people suffer, but through struggle the human spirit will win through, learn to make friends and get their deserved reward - mmm. Nothing makes any of the characters real, and the actors are not helped by this terrible overloaded narration which applies a great weight on the story which cannot breath as every moment is made to seem sooo significant. It is not just that there is no lightness of touch in the direction, or that there is no humour, it is that there is a sense that what is being described is more important than humour, or than the real nature of friendship. Suffice to say i loathe this film and recommend people watch it only as a lesson in what is bad about big budget Hollywood movies."
tt0167261,"I know, I know...everyone loves this movie.  Everyone loved the last movie too, right?  Other than myself, I have only found 2 other people that did not enjoy the first of the LOTR trilogy.  I went into the second one with high hopes - I mean, I disliked the first one to such an extent that I was SURE I would enjoy this one more.  I was right!  But just barely!With apologies to everyone who liked the film (and please remember, this is my opinion, you can have yours...), I found the film to be slightly painful. I don't know why!  I can't fathom my not liking these movies.  Maybe I found it too long.  Maybe I found the fighting scenes to be disjointed and uninspiring.  Maybe I don't like the numerous scenes involving wilted dialogue and sub-par acting.  Maybe it was the seeming attempt at making it a huge, long movie so that it would be considered an epic.  I just don't understand why I don't like the first two movies of the trilogy so far.For my money, the original Star Wars trilogy trumps this one.  Yes, that one had a lot of lame elements, in retrospect (the stupid Ewoks almost ruined it all, no?). It's lonely not liking a blockbuster movie.  I'd almost rather watch the Matrix, and believe me, I hated that movie too. Sorry!  If you liked The Two Towers, I'm happy for you!  Just don't bring me.  Please.  Please?  Please???"
tt0952543,This is a truly horrifying story and if we are the sum of our experiences it's clear from this that there are things people should never experience. Everyone loses in this and there are no winners. Waking The Dead was always a dark show but this pushes the limits of what is bearable and it has to be seen. The performances are astounding and the production is right up there. I've watched it once and I never want to see it again. Powerful stuff.
tt0361748,"Just another terrentino film trying to be a western with over the top gratuitous violence to try and shock the audience. The story is basic and contrived. It's not that the acting is bad given the material - they do the best they have to work with but to call this a great or good film doesn't make a lot of sense. There is no special underlying message. Just a lot of violence for the sake of violence and to satisfy Quentin's strange fascination with blood and gore and thinking that makes him a great writer and director. If you like gore, then this is the movie for you. If you want a good story line you might as well pass."
tt0139414,"I love watching this movie. I love this dialog in a ""horror"" film. I got myself a copy on DVD and watch it at least a few times a year. There are some classic lines between the city folk vs. the bumpkins. Fonda's line about the sarcasm being too subtle is great (while spraying RAID in the middle of Maine). Betty White is building her career these days being the tart-mouthed old broad (see ""Boston Legal"" - another David Kelley production). Also, the interplay between Oliver Platt and the actor playing the sheriff are priceless.Contrary to what others have written - I think the special effects go just fine with the overall campy and comedy feel of the movie and the amount of gore is also appropriate. More would change the tone of the film from the comedy which I enjoy, to one more of a gross-out nature.Just a favorite of mine. Try it if you, for example, liked ""Love at First Bite"" - you will probably like this too."
tt0120737,"... and so the film appears to continue in the same vein, repeating this pattern every half an hour or so.I am a pretty patient person - I don't need loads of action or constant surprises to keep me on the edge of my seat. However, I do appreciate a semblance of a storyline. I am told by friends that the reason I didn't enjoy this film was because i haven't read the book, but to me, this is simply not good enough as an explanation. Yes, we all know that this film is an adaptation of a famous book, but shouldn't the aim of the director then be to draw in new fans, as well as bring the book to life for those who have read the book??I was so disappointed with this - I don't buy into hype, but I did expect a good bit of escapism with this film. Unfortunately, as already mentioned, I failed to find anything that could retain my attention. And, from a person who gets irritated if people so much as sneeze during films: I began a conversation with the person sitting next to me halfway through the film and continued to do so sporadically, whilst simultaneously checking the timer on the DVD player, wondering when my own ordeal would come to an end...I honestly cannot remember how this ends, so no chance of spoilers from me - suffice to say, it doesn't matter in my case, as I have no plans to watch the sequels."
tt1345836,"So Let's see, The Conclusion to Chris Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. Starting with Batman Begins which was a great movie that pioneered the new wave of superhero films with blockbuster action and near art house philosophy with superheroes at the center. It took the concept of fear and turning it into power. Then came what is considered Nolan's greatest work, The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight brought in an engaging villain, ideas of anarchy vs control, real tragedy and analysis on what it takes to turn a hero to the dark side. Then came this movie...Well I personally don't care for it. It's long and pretentious and has loads of laughable moments. Bruce Wayne is written to be a little annoying and out of character. There are GAPING plot holes, nonsensical writing and odd creative decisions.First, what I like about the movie: Bane and Cat-woman. Bane is great. Tom Hardy is a great actor. He can be just a little hard to understand at times but did a great job nonetheless with an intelligent yet intimidating portrayal. That said, the character he played was Bane, in name only. No characteristics were taken from the comics otherwise. Cat-woman is great and that's all I can say. Her scenes are the most fun to watch in the movie.So where did the movie go wrong? Well, it has a lot to say but never takes the time to say it. It's also over 2 and a half hours long, which I don't usually mind but the editing and pacing are very hectic. It never takes the time to examine it's characters. Batman is a whiny recluse now and that character change plays no real part in the story later.The Batman voice is even more annoying in this one. The plot of the Dark Knight is made completely useless. They could have skipped that movie and gone to this one and everything would have been fine. the only remnant is Bruce Wayne's trauma (which goes NOWHERE) and the Dent act which caused peace (which goes NOWHERE). Things they could have cut out of the movie to save time since they clearly lengthened the movie ad cut bits and pieces everywhere.Bane has an overly complicated plan that involves (yet is not limited to) stealing Bruce Wayne's fingerprints, bankrupting him, breaking batman and throwing him into prison, destroying the city for the next 5 months, taking over the city and revealing the lies of commissioner Gordan, using tech from Wayne industries to break open black gate prison, then nuking the city. In that exact order. Why not just break Batman then nuke the city?Some Questions: If Bane has Bruce's fingerprints why is he stealing his tech? And why bankrupt him if you're just going to throw him in a pit and take over the city anyway? What is Bane's motivation really? He says the criminals are oppressed by the government but never explains how. His MO keeps changing though out the movie really Why is he attacking Gotham and claiming it needs to be saved like this when the first 30 minutes established Gotham is perfectly fine and at ""peace time""? If you're going to say because the commissioner lied about Two-face you'd be wrong because the league of shadows has no problem with lying and deceit to gain power (evidenced by Batman Begins and this movie). Why put Batman, WORLDS GREATEST DETECTIVE, in a prison A CHILD once escaped from? Why keep him alive anyway? The entire ""your punishment must be more severe"" line has no logic in it. The league of shadows kills its enemies but now it just keeps the most dangerous ones alive?Talia al Ghul appears. I have issues with this. Why do her and Bruce Suddenly start having sex completely out of nowhere when they've JUST met? she says she hated her father for banishing Bane but still wants to carry out his plan. WHY? Why send EVERY policeman in Gotham to fight Bane in the sewers? couldn't they have gassed the sewer instead or kept some officers on the surface?Aside from those questions, there is really no chemistry between Bruce and Talia or Batman and Cat-woman or Bane and Talia. These romances happen without any prior indication and just confused me.It's not very faithful to the comics, but Nolan never wanted it to be anyway. I don't mind that and the other 2 movies did it pretty well, but in this case it's so far from the comics that there's no reason for this to be a Batman film. NONE. Other than the costumes. Where is the detective work? Where is the use of intelligence? Where is the dark atmosphere? most of this movie happens in the day time. Where's the noir feel that Batman is known for? Bane is nothing like this in the comics and for that matter neither is Talia.But I'd let that slide if the plot made logical sense. Bane's and Talia's deaths are both completely lackluster scenes. The ending was predictable and foreshadowed heavily by both Lucius Fox and Alfred. And speaking of the ending... BATMAN DOESN'T QUIT!!!!! WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS THAT ABOUT? ONE OF THE MAIN FOCUSES OF THE COMICS IS BATMAN'S OBSESSION WITH CRIME AND HOW IT CONSUMES HIS LIFE!! HE STAYS BATMAN TILL OLD AGE. It might sound nit- picky but it's a major trait that batman has.There's just so much wrong with this movie. It has great scenes but they don't make sense in terms of the over-all film. Things aren't really explained very well either. to each their own I guess. This was not for me."
tt0139414,"If anyone is thinking of actually seeing this movie, don't. Please. I'm not kidding. Really. That paint that you weren't going to watch dry? Well, go and watch it 'cause it's a hell of a lot more interesting than this C rate, tries-to-be- funny ""Jaws"" clone. To borrow a line from Homer Simpson, ""I've seen better plays than this. Honest to god, plays!"""
tt0480025,"This Is England sends a strong message. Whether you view it as being anti-fascist or promoting racist and anti-social violent behavior, you can't underestimate the power this film packs. It's an awesomely raw view on the skinhead epidemic that plagued England in the 70's and 80's. It has some very gripping moments, with slightly not so gripping moments, but pass the hour mark and this film really kicks into gear.A great film that studies not only the Neo-Nazi movement, but also characterizes the change of people in it. The two opposing gangs are so polar that you can feel the full motives of both groups. An excellent, but not perfect, British film that has it all for everyone."
tt0816692,"Science Fiction works best when it sprinkles an element of actual science onto a canvas and then let's the imagination do the rest. Anything is possible right?This film however, drags you by the hair into a classroom, forcefully inserts the torn pages of science textbooks into your mouth, scribbles something ridiculous on the blackboard, urinates in the corner and then wanders out half way through muttering something dumb about love. That's all before Matt Damon turns up to ruin your day.I won't even talk about the ending...I love real science documentaries and science fiction films in equal measures. But they should not climb into bed with each other. The offspring will not be pretty as is the proof here.Honestly I really did want to like this film, on paper it would tick every one of my boxes, but I'm more concerned now for the mental well being of everyone who has rated this so highly and I really don't get the cult like following of certain film cast or directors. It is definitely life changing, but not in a good way.On the other hand, the visuals and the soundtrack are both fantastic hence the rating of 5. If we could do a people's cut of the movie with no dialogue, no acting, no plot, just shots of space and beautiful frozen alien planet landscapes, then I would give this 10 without a moments hesitation.Do watch it though and make up your own mind, but please don't say it's the best film ever made or any pukey nonsense like that."
tt0109830,"Delicate and warm American theme. The different fates of Forrest Gump and Jenny are almost a mockery of the affirmative action movement in the 1960s, and Forrest Gump's burial of Jenny is also the burial of America's own history in the 1960s. The writing is beautiful, the editing is clever, the monologues are soulful, and Tom Hanks' acting is flawless, but the film's values are dubious. So divided."
tt0468569,"Batman is a comic strip! The Dark Knight thinks it's Dostoyevsky! Over long, exceedingly tiresome and boring, one note performances, stale CGI stunts with a script that is more pretentious than portentous! Director Chris Nolan gets some marks for subtly taking the rise out of Bush and America, and convincing a very large audience they are watching Fellini, Tarantino, M. Mann and Carol Reed all rolled into one! Yes, folks, if it's dark, it must be a serious film!!!! I loved the holes in the plot(must be deliberate), when The Joker says he is an anarchist, who does not plan, but then produces several stunts that would have required Rand McNally precision and hundreds of accomplices! And please,I know he died under strange circumstances, but Heath Ledger, although not bad,is miles behind Jack Nicholson. As for the rating certificate, the British censor should be thoroughly ashamed of himself, or did he think it was just a Tom and Jerry comic cartoon?"
tt0109830,"A clear case of mass appeal prevailing over cinematic substance. The uber-conservative approach takes to US history is frankly misrepresentational at best. In a technique reminiscent of Woody Allen's ""Zelig"", the title character involves himself in all of the most famous events of the last forty years. Basically, the movie vilifies the protest movements of the 60's and preaches blissful ignorance under the apparently Gump-invented slogan: ""S**t happens"". Why create a hero who celebrates stupidity as a national characteristic is anyone's guess. Any true American patriot with an intelligence quotient above 75 would be deeply offended by the disservice the film does to our country. But even on a purely objective level,  ""Forrest Gump"" is deeply flawed. Not only does the film shamelessly borrow (or makes a very conspicuous ""homage"") from such masterpieces as ""Midnight Cowboy"", it is also poorly structured. Lacking any visible climax, it has a potential to end at any point during its third hour. Alas, it pointlessly drags on and on, as Tom Hanks gets into even more of his ""stupid"" adventures."
tt0109830,"I am surprised that `Forrest Gump' made it on the 1997 AFI list of the 100 best American films. My only explanation is that had the virtue of being a recent film. It is memorable, no doubt, but it doesn't fit together.When I first saw the film, I didn't understand the Black Panthers or even the specifics of the Vietnam War. Ultimately I was lost at some places. Now I understand the history, and my stomach turns at the thought of squeezing forty years of history into a two and a half hour film; it didn't work. Digressing, I am shocked by how disgustingly idiotic the character is portrayed, under the guise of a 75 IQ. I'm no expert, but I don't see someone with that IQ dropping his pants or letting himself be hit by rocks. Frankly, the rural areas of the South where young Gump grew up didn't yield rocket scientists. This is because common sense was taught instead of the abstract reasoning of the Weschler IQ scorer. Just because a person cannot recite ten numbers backwards doesn't mean that they will drop their pants on TV.I'm lingering on this because it annoys me due to my elementary knowledge of these facts which were overlooked in the plot of the film. In the 1979 film `Being There', Peter Sellers plays Chance, a gardener with a mind similar to Forrest Gump; even a little simpler. However, his character never left the house where he was born and learned everything from television.Next up on the docket, Vietnam. Vietnam was not funny, nor is its interpretation through the eyes of Private Gump. I don't like heavy-handed Vietnam films like `Platoon' or `Apocalypse Now', and this film is more accurate, visually; so I hear. As for the aftermath, Lieutenant Dan's post-war trauma so closely models that of Jon Voight's character in `Coming Home' that I would sue for copyright infringement.The acting has ups and downs. Gary Senise is excellent as Lieutenant Dan. Robin Wright's dime-a-dozen performance makes me want to throw up. Sally Field is good in her few scenes. Star Tom Hanks is overrated and, frankly, not deserving of that golden statuette. As for the film's Best Picture Oscar, I can only conclude that the judges knew they would be lynched by angry mothers, old people, and arch-conservatives if they selected the ultra-controversial, though much better, film `Pulp Fiction'.`Forrest Gump' has highlights however. The bus stop bench as a forum was a fresh idea. The Bubba-Gump Shrimp section is hilarious. And the too-little-too-late drama at the end of the film sticks with you.Make your own decision, I'm playing it safe with a 5/10."
tt0361748,"What's better than dudes killin Nazis?It is no surprise to say that this film is indeed a masterpiece of cinema. Not only in terms of writing, but the acting and execution as well. It uses every element of film in order to create tension and suspense mainly through the use of dialogue and camera work. There are multiple scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat simply because two people are having a conversation. My friend who had just seen the film for the first time calls it ""Tension: The Movie.""
When it comes to atmosphere, Tarantino is the king at creating suspense and tension in a scene. I've never seen a war film like this. It's able to balance action, comedy and drama perfectly.This film has one of my favorite opening scenes of all time. Tarantino's writing combined with Christoph Waltz genius acting and they can make any conversation seem like the most interesting thing in the world. This opening scene is both intriguing and extremely tense and grabs the attention of the viewer right away. Christoph Waltz is absolutely amazing in this film. He feels like a genuine psychopath. The character of Hans Landa is extraordinary. I also really liked the character of Shoshanna. Being a Jew myself it is awesome seeing all these Nazi's get killed by this vengeful girl. I couldn't help but feel for Shoshanna. She was definitely one of the best characters in the film with a great arc. The way she goes out is brutal. Daniel Bruhl was also great in this movie. Poor guy had PTSD and just wanted some.The characters within the Basterds are great as well. Specifically Brad Pitt and Eli Roth. The Bear Jew was awesome and the scene where we are first introduced to him really hypes him up and it doesn't disappoint. Such a well filmed scene. It really is hard not to laugh or smile when the Bear Jew starts swingin the bat. Michael Fassbender is in this film and I was surprised that he wasn't in it longer. But, his scenes were really good and he does a great job. In fact that scene in the basement bar is one of the best if not the best scene in the film. Literally every scene is so well written and interesting. There are no scenes that drag and everything that is shown or said has a purpose.Overall, Inglorious Basterds is a masterpiece, no doubt about it. It is one of the most well written films i've ever seen. All the performances are amazing, the script is fantastic, and the direction is perfect. I don't have any flaws for this film. It is one of my favorite films of all time. It is so extremely well thought out. All the characters are interesting. The opening scene is one of the best in film, and the entire third act is just perfect. In fact the whole film is honestly a perfect movie. It is also extremely rewatchable. Which is hard for a movie that is this long. But, it is so entertaining you will genuinely enjoy it with each watch.This is what moviemaking is all about. Exceeding audience expectations and keeping the viewer entertained throughout while delivering a great story. That is art. As Aldo says in the final line of the movie, ""This just might be my masterpiece."" And honestly Tarantino, I think it is. *chefs kiss*"
tt0848228,"Being at one time a young ten year old kid who cut his teeth on 'COWBOY SAM' books and 'JOHN HENRY AND THE DOUBLE-JOINTED STEAM DRILL' as well 'UNCLE ARTHUR'S BEDTIME STORIES', the adventures of the MARVEL UNIVERSE were a welcome introduction into what the older kids were reading and doing. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby somehow as though by divine guidance properly gauged the angst of those teenage years in the Sixties and the zeitgeist of that era. Before the Avengers battled the Space Phantom, I cannot remember when I ever encountered a Superhero like the Hulk. Basically he was a bully in diapers who did not play well with others. After the Avengers at last sent the Space Phantom back into limbo where he belonged, the Hulk related that his feelings were hurt by the remarks others made about him during the heat of battle. He gave the Avengers his walking papers and jumped off into parts unknown.This never would have happened in the JUSTICE LEAGUE.During the showing I attended, after the credits were done, there is a scene where the Avengers are sitting together in a restaurant eating. The expressions on their faces indicate that they would all rather be somewhere else. When I first saw it, it appeared a little non-sequitur and just something added-on to pique interest. But then I went to my Volume 1 of the ESSENTIAL AVENGERS which covers the first twenty four issues of their saga. I decided to use it as a reference for my remarks in this review. When I got to page two of Issue Two, there it was right at the bottom! Essentially the same scene that tagged the end of the Avengers movie. Oh, the setting was different as well as a couple of the characters present or absent, but the theme of the scene was identical to the movie. A bunch of misfits decide to get together and meet regularly in order to increase and better facilitate group cohesion and they can barely stand being in each other's presence! It's the American Experience reductio ad absurdum. It is also the Human Experience should you wish to wax philosophical about it.Reminds me of something I once heard Jesse Jackson declare during a speech and I believe he was quoting Martin Luther King; ""We have to learn to live together no matter how painful, or we'll die apart as fools.""Suffice it to say that for the Avengers working together and living together is particularly painful at times.No, Robert Downey Jr. would not have ordinarily come to mind as Tony Stark AKA IRON MAN, with his yuppie insouciance, but this is a new generation with its own issues and tastes, so there's no use asking ""-where have you gone Errol Flynn and Ronald Coleman?"". They're probably having lunch with Joe DiMaggio. Downey, in his own way, does more than represent with IRON MAN.Knowing this genre intimately and well, this time I may be too close to it to effectively evaluate it. There are all kinds of things in this movie that do not fit, but that's the glory of the Marvel Universe. It is a depot for all the things that do not fit that are somehow made to achieve this transcendent irreverent harmony, rhythm and balance. As Edward G. Robinson once said in THE CINCINNATI KID, ""-sort of like Life-"".Samuel L. Jackson has no real business being in the AVENGERS doing his usual scenery chewing, channeling bits of 'SHAFT' and 'HAWK' and the Black Man's angst about wanting in on the American Dream. For one thing, the original Nick Fury was a white World War Two hero who headed a squad called Sgt. Fury's Howling Commandos. He would probably be in his nineties by now, but only a time chosen few would know that. Besides, that's the beauty of this fantasy scenario. Nobody really questions what or who these super-powered characters are supposed to be avenging. Actually they're more like the FINAL GUARDIANS than AVENGERS. Anyway, you really would be missing the point pursuing this line of questioning. Here are all these odds and ends of personality and death-defying events and cultural themes somehow welded and soldered together in a kind of collage of imagination and experience and juvenile science fiction and it all works because in the end this ain't your universe. It's the MARVEL UNIVERSE and you're just living and thrilling in it. When you look at it that way, Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury gets down and gets back, and redefines the American Dream as something more than that house with the little white picket fence and perhaps simply the divine right to be whatever you want to be.Joss Whedon and Zak Penn finally wised up and decided to stand on the shoulders of giants Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, instead of jumping off to do their own thing with the Marvel Universe. They have written a tale to celebrate. Joss Whedon's direction is Marvelouseque rather than a penetrating interpretation that sometimes hits and sometimes misses as in the case with Sam Rami's SPIDERMAN movies.Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, Tom Huddleston as Loki, Scarlet Johansson as the Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, all have sufficient back stories now either through prior movies or the comics for the audience to be thoroughly prepared for what they might do. They are all so very nearly the characters themselves that all that's left is to be swept up in the action that is truly our satisfaction. And yet, the thing that makes the greatest impact in the end is the characters themselves.Welcome to the Marvel Age of Comics in Cinema!"
tt0108052,"I've watched this film about half a dozen times over the last five years and I still don't really understand what Spielberg was trying to do.  Was he trying to outline the horrors of the holocaust or was he trying to examine Schindler himself - why the man did what he did? Maybe both.  In neither case does he succeed.  One can't help but feel the atrocities were greatly toned down for this film thus not really reflecting the true horror of what really happened, and he fails completely in exploring the character of Schindler.  Why did Schindler do what he did?  The man was a philanderer and a shrewd business man who didn't exactly go out of his way to be nice.  Did witnessing what he did make him wake up to himself or perhaps there was an ulterior motive?  Spielberg looks at none of this and serves up a modern day saint.  It is kind of ironic that Spielberg shot this movie in black and white because that is the approach he has taken to his subject material.  He gives us the saintly Schindler, the stereotypical evil Nazi, the honourable Jew and none of the complexities that made these people what they are.  This was Spielberg's attempt to become accepted as a serious film-maker but yet he takes exactly the same approach to making this as he did with his marvellous popcorn movies resulting in a rather dictatorial film that has more answers than questions!"
tt0109830,"I'm either the only person in the world who didn't get this movie, or the only one who did. When I saw it I figured the only way to evaluate it was as a variation on the great ""Being There""-a wicked satire. But then the mainstream reviews began pouring in and it became clear that people were taking this Charming Simpleton tripe seriously. Does anyone really believe that the same Robert Zemeckis who directed one of the most scathing, vicious comedies ever (""Used Cars"") has suddenly gone simple himself and meant this to be taken at face value? It's not a healthy sign when so many people seem to regard a mentally challenged individual as a role model for all to emulate."
tt0468569,"Gotham is cleaning its act up, Batman is a successful crime fighting Legend, Jim Gordon is moving up the ranks and Harvey Dent is a tour-de-force for the city as its high flying District Attorney. Nothing can go wrong, can it? Well that it is except for a lunatic criminal called the Joker decides to bring chaos to Gotham, Batman is faced with a criminal who will stop at nothing to make a point and is seemingly always one step ahead of the Dark Knight, will he cross the line and kill to stop the madman and make Gotham safe, and will Bruce Wayne get to hang up his cape and get the happiness he deserves.After Batman Begins the scene was set for a bigger and better film to follow and after hearing all the hype I felt that this film could not fail ...I was very wrong. There are a number of issues that I had with the film that I have yet to hear a good defence for. The great films may not be liked by everyone for bizarre reasons but their criticisms are usually swept aside by the faithful. There are far too many errors in this film for it to pass such tests. I will address them one at a time, as one by one these spoilt the film for me.The first is that the film drags and drags and drags. Around the time of Batman's big decision of who he gets to save seems to be the perfect time to end it, on an Empire style ending, instead it goes on and on and we have about thirty to forty minutes extra to wrap everything up that the film simply doesn't need. End it with suspense, leave me on a high, but if I'm looking at my watch you've failed.Two, the performance of Heath Ledger is not all that. Yes, he is dead and this is sad, but the Joker we get in this film is sadly not the Joker of ""The Killing Joke"" or the Joker of ""The Dark Knight"", sadly it is somewhere in-between and this version is very mish-mashy, added to that the make-up changes from scene to scene when the jokers skin is supposed to be white all the time, also the make-up should make him look like he's smiling, DO YOU GET IT WRITERS, HE IS CALLED THE JOKER. Did he laugh that often in the film, I think not, he hardly smiled at all either, what's that for? For me, the big star turn in the film is by Aaron Eckhart who is magnificent as Harvey Dent and seems to steal every scene that he is in. Eckhart cranks the film up and makes it his own, and this is what increases the rating as it does.The action sequences that are so gripping in the first film are sadly lacking here as the editing to make it a lower rating and get more bums on seats have cut the films strongest feature to shreds.The last thing that really trashes the film for me is the end sequence with the Joker's final trap, as there is little explanation of how he has done this, are we expected to believe that the Joker is magic as that is what it feels like the director is saying. I'm all for big surprises but this was just too unbelievable, and I'm saying that about a film that has a man dressing up as a giant bat! Many of the people I have spoken to claim to love the film yet so few have any defence of the errors I speak of here, many of them Jump in and agree, and sometimes even add to the list, which annoys me for two reasons, because it will mean that more rubbish will get churned out that is supposed to be good and also because people's standards by accepting sub-standard films as good are lowering and we should always, as viewers, expect more, and pace, performance, writing and even make-up should all be first rate when $170 million dollars have been spent.Maybe many people feel that because there is so much hype for a film, and so much critical acclaim that they must be wrong for not liking it, when the truth is that the people who don't like it all that much are the ones who are right and those that just suck up to the critics view are very wrong. Thankfully I have been here before and faced exactly the same backlash 14 years ago for saying I didn't enjoy ""Jurassic Park"" which had similar levels of hype and got similar levels of public favour at the time of release. I find it interesting that it is now so very far down the rankings as, upon release, it was supposed to be the best film ever, according to the critics.No film could get a reaction like this on these boards without some element of over-reaction, and in this case it's to Ledger's death, the best time to judge this film will be in a year's time when the hype has died down, and for those who can admit they made a mistake to rethink their over-hyped ratings.Disappointing."

tt0172495,"Whenever a new Ridley Scott movie appears, I can hardly contain my indifference.  He's way too variable in terms of quality for me to get excited about a new release: Alien is a great movie, Thelma and Louise is nothing special, White Squall is pants, and G.I. Jane was surprisingly good, but I'm the only person who seems to think so.  With this track record, as I walked into Gladiator I was less expectant than Adam Sandler on Oscar night. It turned out to be worse than I thought.Gladiator is an epic-by-numbers.  Sweeping shots over cities, a couple of thousand extras wearing togas, a few seconds in a battle scene where the music turns to silence and the direct-o-matic uses a different shutter speed...  Seen it all before.  While everyone else was dropping their jaws, my thumbs got busy with the twiddling.If you're going to make a movie where the audience can root for the underdog, you should at least blur the lines a little.  Gladiator's heroic goodies and hissable baddies are so obvious even Spielberg would have complained.  For the Autobots, we have Russell Crowe.  He gets fired from his job, sentenced to death, manages to escape only to find his wife raped and his children murdered, is sold into slavery, forced to perform in front of bloodthirsty crowds as a gladiator, loses his car keys and steps on a dog poo.  For the Decepticons, we have Joaquim Phoenix, who killed his own dad, ordered the deaths of Crowe and his family, forces people to fight and die for his entertainment, wants to do his sister, and kicks puppies in the teeth.  It's as balanced as a see-saw with Jabba the Hutt on one end and Calista Flockhart on the other.It has pretensions above the action movie it knows it really is, and it's at those points that the film moves from boring to laughable.  We're told, over and over again, that gladiator fights are brutal, that  the crowds are disgusting for watching, and that the men are unwilling to take part.  It was at this point I phoned Amnesty International to see what we could do to stop this barbaric sport.  Are we really learning anything by this?  It's in these moments, too, that the film's hypocrisy becomes obvious.  While the viewers are weeping at the injustice of it all, they're also excited by Crowe's muscular heroics, and the slo-mo, pop-promo style used for the bloody fight scenes.  We can condemn the audience in the colosseum for enjoying it, while happily stuffing popcorn down our faces and cheering when Crowe stabs another gladiator.  Is he the only one fighting against his will, or are the people he kills innocent victims too?  Who cares?  We've moved past the pathos now, we're on to the fight scenes.  Carry on Cleo had more emotional impact.The ending is as predictable as possible.  Did anyone really think it would end with Phoenix still in power?  The only good thing about the ending was that it actually had one.  Three weeks into the movie I was starting to have my doubts.  Overlong, over-rated, add it to the list of undeserving modern classics."
tt1853728,"Looks like Tarantino is getting old and jaded. He generally has a small acting role in his movies, in this one he looked like Elvis in the latter part of his career and so does the movie. Going through the motions with little emotional involvement or imagination. I am actually quite a fan of Tarantino and had hoped to see his equivalent of Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven but left the theater disappointed. The movie was far too long for what was on offer (not that much) and the ending seemed to be a 20 minute add on to meet blood and gore quotas and nothing more. As regards acting, this movie should leave a few of the famous thinking like Silvester Stallone after he made Rhinestone. I understand he basically paid to have that movie taken out of circulation. Samuel Jackson, in particular, may soon be doing the same. His role was far from sympathetic, but made worse by overacting. Don't give up the day job Quentin."
tt0480025,"Brilliant story, brilliant acting, funny, frightening and sad. So many films, you see Pele get shot or blown up all the time and it means nothing. In this film, the violence feels horrible, like you're being attacked. NOt everyone knows skinheads, but people will recognise characters from this film- growing up, wanting to fit in with older kids, trying to be cool, the posing aggressive sorts. Shane Meadows is a class director. Conflicted violent/ vulnerable characters are always interesting to watch, but in Woody they created a nice-guy type who is also compelling in his own way. One thing I didn't understand was this guy in their gang who was about 40 and seemed to tag along without anyone questioning."
tt0993846,"This was about the most unredeemable movie that I can remember. The acting was over the top with only a few bit players turning in good performances Joanna Lumley as Aunt Emma comes to mind. Jordan Belfort tells his tale of excess without remorse or humor. I sincerely hope that he had a few sober moments in the late 80's and early90's where he accomplished something good, he doesn't seem to remember any of it. Most recovering addicts that I have met have tried to honestly reflect their past and turn away from it. Mr. Belfort has found a new drug in reveling in the hangover of his past. This movie is at best an extended drug flashback, one which has nothing to say about the human condition other than that Mr. Belfort and friends were degenerate. I knew that coming in and gained mo insight other than to be skeptical if I ever meet this guy in the future.Save your money save your time even Fox News has more to offer."
tt0422272,"What could I say about ""Fragile""? Well... it was a rainy evening in my town (totally true, not to give effects), and instead of going to the town party I decided to go to the cinema. I had a good idea because I've always admired Balaguer√≥ (Los Sin Nombre... great), and I love horror films too, but, like I've said, I had seen three horror movies before and none of them really frightened me. So I got to the cinema and waited for it to start. The atmosphere is very good, it seems they worked a lot to make it, but not only the atmosphere was right like in other films, the story is convincing too, not just ""killing-screaming-the end"". It starts about a nurse who goes to work in a hospital in an English island. The hospital is about to be closed and the few children who are still there are supposed to be out of there soon. But it's not as easy as it seems, strange things happen in that hospital, one of the girls see somebody who lived and died there, and that ""somebody"" hurts the kids, by breaking their bones most of the times. The real interest is in what is behind that story, who is that somebody, and why he or she behaves like that. The acting is correct, Elena Anaya, Richard Roxburgh (finally a good role for him!), Calista Flockhart and the kids work efficiently. And most... I'd never been so frightened for a long time. I think that good stories are that which scare me. The same happened with ""The Changeling"" (somehow similar, somehow different). But worth seeing both of them. I recommend it."
tt0381429,"Somersault underlines a girl's desire of not wanting to be alone. The main character, Heidi, may appear to be flirtatious toward guys; yet what she wants is really to have a company. I guess her characteristics are derived from her mother, Nicole. Thus this is one interesting point of view to look at: about the parallelism of stories between the mother and the daughter. From the short appearance of Nicole, I believe she has her own story of not wanting to be alone. Else, where would Heidi come from? In terms of storyline, I see the simple third act form; beginning, middle, end. Heidi has a journey, and after all the troubles, she manages to resolve with her problems. Heidi's diary might help the audience to know Heidi's back-story. I like how clever the dialog between Heidi and her 'boyfriend' is constructed. In terms of technicalities, the use of landscape and natural elements helps the audience to engage with the story. The snow, the ""tears"" caused by using hot water to crack the snow on the car's windscreen, the red color¬Ö (I am not going to spoil the film here =) ). The mood of the film is very blue from the very beginning; we even see a blue laundry basket! When the resolution is made, though, the light brightens¬Ö very nice indeed. ""It's good that we met"", Somersault."
tt0372784,"this was one of my favorite movies of the year. and i don't say that lightly. i saw this movie with my friend as a backup to lords of dogtown which was sold out and boy am i glad i did. Christian Bale did an amazing job with the tough role of being batman. i then saw this with my cousin who loved it as well. this is probably the best superhero movie I've ever seen. superman, horrible. batman, OK. spider-man the first one, OK. spider-man 2, boring. and so on. but this, this was amazing. it was well worth the 10 dollars to see it and i cant wait until it comes out on DVD. one of the best movies of the year and it deserves to be in the top 10."
tt1375666,"The pieces of the movie are amazing:
1. Hans Zimmer's music is hauntingly beautiful, probably my favorite movie score ever.2. The premise is unique and fascinating
3. The special effects are amazing and don't distract (unlike some Pierce Brosnan Bond movies). They fit into the plot perfectly.4. The acting is very good.But the assemled pieces make the whole only very good, not amazing: The movie is just too big, and they had to edit it to cut it down to essential info and scenes, resulting in a slightly unnatural flow that feels like trying to drink from a fire hose shoved in your mouth. A mild, subtle infodump feeling arises at times. There are no natural lulls or pauses to digest info. The first time watching you will feel absolutely lost for the first 45 minutes or so unless you read spoilers first, due to a combination of that flow and some out of sequence story telling. The 2nd time watching will be much more enjoyable than the first... it is that lesser enjoyment the first time through that keeps it from being amazing, knocking it down to just very good. There are two main storylines, one mostly in the present, the other about the main character's past...found myself wondering if the latter could have been less prominent or even cut to focus more on the former."
tt0993846,"I would just like to say that I got absolutely nothing out of the viewing of The Wolf Of Wall Street. It is easily the worst effort ever from Martin Scorsese. The story line is almost non existent , DiCaprio is just a loser with a loud mouth, and all the surrounding characters are one dimensional. I don't see any moral battle being fought, I don't care about seeing hookers, lots of drugs being taken , or stupid parties, very boring. The real role model in the story cites his hero's as Gordon Gekko of Wall Street, Don Johnson of Miami Vice, and Richard Gere in Pretty Woman, what a completely shallow loser, even in todays bottom feeding America. The whole effort is simple B movie territory, not just because of the 80's and 90's settings. Couple this film with American Hustle, and you have a pretty awful state of 2014 film-making."
tt0111161,"If you simply see this as a straightforward storytelling prison film, then it is excellent (10/10) because it truly gets you involved in its main character. It is an extremely enjoyable and compelling experience with a heartfelt and well-acted buddy-story at its core. It delicately--and sometimes brutally--juxtaposes Andy Dufresne's (Tim Robbins) good-natured character with the harshness of prison life, projecting so much heart in doing so.However delightful as it is, The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance. It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches - it's only a very safe buddy-story. A damn good one, but still just that. So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied, because what will it be remembered for? Friendship? Huh, neat. I therefore don't think it's entirely deserving of being considered the #2 greatest film of all time on IMDb.com.But moving on and looking past that, it is possibly one of my all-time favourite films for the feelings it leaves. Sure, it often jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely, but this is forgivable because emotion is crucial to a prison story. On top of that, it never falls prey to predictable sappiness - probably because of its content which is devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic friendship. It is so well-sewn together by a feel-good narrative by Morgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film.9/10"
tt1345836,"What makes things worse, is that its predecessors were basically intricate works of genius, but TDKR lacks essentially everything that made The Dark Knight (particularly) one of the greatest superhero movies ever produced. On top of all this, everyone's bandwagoning on thinking it's great because it's ""supposed"" to be great, right?!?! How could Nolan's finale not be a masterpiece?! Well, I'll tell you...Bruce Wayne acts out-of-character from not just the first two movies, but from the comic as well. Catwoman's motivation and place in the story is weak, flat, and forced. For a movie that's almost three hours long, you only get about 20 minutes of Batman in costume (if you're lucky). The movie jumps in weird time increments that are mildly confusing, but mostly forced to facilitate its wanna-be epic nature.As for more heavily SPOILERY observations...Commissioner Gordon is barely in the movie, spending most his time injured in a hospital, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character comes out of the blue and does what you'd expect the Commissioner to be doing... solution- COMBINE THE TWO CHARACTERS!!!The two Batman vs. Bane fights are flat and boring as hell. Bane is a cardboard, unexplored (until a late-third act flashback... of all ridiculous clich√© plot devices) character that reaches for sympathy in one of the most embarrassing, wanna-be-tender, totally out-of-place, extremely laughable scenes I've ever seen in my life- HE FRIGGIN' CRIES?!!?!?Every single, yes EVERY SINGLE cop in Gotham marches down into the sewers on a tip that Bane's raising a secret army, only to have all the entrances blown up so they can be trapped down there... for like three months. Reread that last sentence and tell me what part of it makes sense.Bane holds Gotham hostage with a 4 megaton nuclear device, after blowing up all but one bridge leading into and out of the city, for three months and the U.S. government does nothing. Seriously, nothing. It's said they negotiated a truce and had FEMA send in supplies for survival. Read that last paragraph and tell me what part of it makes sense.The ""real"" villain reveals him/her self in an absurd Act 3 ""twist"" that's followed by a narrated flashback (the same one that leads to Bane CRYING), and throughout the entire monologue Batman sits there doing nothing after a knife has been thrust/held into his side.After the 2nd lame Bats/Bane fight, the bulk of the late Act 3rd ""action sequence"" consists of little more than Batman flying around in that weird-looking clunky flying thing that supposed to be the Bat Plane- half of which is of him outmaneuvering missiles that the bulky ""plane"" couldn't have possibly eluded.I really, really, really, really, really, really wanted to not just like this, but LOVE it, but as it progressed the enthusiasm cloud gradually cleared to the point of my being utterly flabberghasted in disappointment- mostly because I can't believe the director of The Dark Knight and the masterpiece that is Inception was responsible for this movie. It's lazy and uninspired to the point of being offensive to everyone who's ever been not just a Batman fan, but a fan of non- intelligence-insulting movies."
tt1345836,"Every time a good superhero movie is made ,fanatic fanboys have to rush to IMDb to declare it as the ""Greatest Movie Ever Made"" LOL,, I do give them credit for a least being consistent. With that said, it was a good movie but should not even be in any top 100. Yes, the storyline was far fetched for real life but hey, it's the norm for a sci-fi thriller action movie. Villain wants to destroy stuff,, hero must stop him. It was well acted, and the action, while not ground breaking was shot very well. While Anne Hathaway is great to look at, and done an okay job , I felt you could of totally removed her character from the entire film and it would not have made any difference . It was almost like her role was just filler material. In the end to me it's just a fun summer movie to get lost in,,but not to put on a pedestal..."

tt0102926,"Having read both the Prequel (Manhunter) and Silence of the Lambs, I was looking forward to seeing how the transition to the screen went.A while back ""Manhunter"" was released, and although abridged and with a different (but better) ending, I loved it. Particularly Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecter, soft spoken, analytical and very, very calm. However, always an undercurrent of danger and a mere whisper of insanity.Now on to ""Silence of the Lambs"" - Hannibal Lecter has gone from being an all too believable real-life monster to a giggling Hollywood psycho - a veritable troll complete with his own dungeon (alas, no smoking torches) and a set of eyes wide enough to make Marty Feldman blink.Serial murderers such as this, particularly highly intelligent ones, do not prance about revelling in how evil they are, nor do they speak in such ridiculous snidley tones.They appear quite normal - the reason why they managed to get away with what they did for the length of time they did. Occasionally they speak in monotones and look at nothing in particular. Check out interviews of real-life serial killers - you won't find Anthony Hopkins's fairground pastiche there.The story itself rambled, the interplay between the two characters did'nt work - Hopkins possibly due to the material, Foster due to the lack of a believable protagonist. They have thankfully both done far better work than this both before and since.There were some (very few) well designed moments and images but the end was both predictable and dissapointing.Films are supposed to mirror real life, not the expected perceptions of the mainstream. Otherwise, what happens to creativity?Oh dear - we're back in Hollywood again.Dan"
tt0372784,"After reading the numerous good reviews of this film, I was expecting a seriously made, deep movie that explored the batman character in a meaningful way. There are so many things wrong with this film, but basically it just quickly degenerates into the typical brain dead Hollywood teen-pleasing crapola. I think all the A list actors were just collecting fat pay checks. I know Bale was probably looking for a blockbuster movie to propel his face a bit more into the mainstream, but he picked a turkey here. I really think Bale is a brilliant actor (as he showed in American Psycho) but he is wasted in this movie.The action sequences suffer from the modern Hollywood 'X-box' editing desease, where no shot stays on screen for more than a split second. This simply confuses the viewer as to exactly what he's supposed to be seeing. The score is good, but pervades far too much throughout the film. The plot is pretty ridiculous.I won't carry on criticising it, but this movie DOES NOT deserve to be anything like #80 in the IMDb list (as it presently is). Is this really a better movie than Midnight Cowboy??!!??!! I think not.Does absolutely NOTHING to restore my nearly extinguished hope that Hollywood is ever going to make brilliant mainstream movies again, like it used to do in the 70s (Godfather, Deer Hunter, Deliverance, etc. etc. etc.)"
tt0114369,"Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is a wearied homicide detective. Mills (Brad Pitt) worked hard to transfer to the troubled precinct. He's married to Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow). There is a serial killer on the loose delivering his sermon on the Seven Deadly Sins. Somerset is tired of the city. Mills is eager to investigate.Director David Fincher has filled with beautiful darkness. It's more than just the gruesome murders. It's the rain, the music score and the grungy setting. Fincher has weaved together an artistic masterpiece. Freeman is the perfect grizzled veteran. Brad Pitt is a terrific eager newcomer. There are surprising comedy sprinkled in. The final twist is simply cinematic history. The big line is awesome. Pitt delivers it perfectly with so much heart aching pleading. Some do deride its grotesque gloom but that's like complaining about a movie being too funny or too exciting. This is suppose to be dark and it achieves it."
tt0120815,"Being interested in history enormously and loving films with an historical background, I was very interested in this one at first. But I really think this film is the very reason, I started to dislike movies about WWII. American productions dealing with this topic always include a lot of bathos, but this one was too much after all and I have no clue how come, so many critics are amazed by it. The description of the events is horribly one-sided and unrealistic that I can only recommend to watch ""Das Boot"" or ""Der Untergang"" (downfall) instead to get a realistic impression of what was going on back then.I still voted with three because the performance by Tom Hanks as a soldier suffering from Parkinson was quite good and interesting. I'm thus still waiting for a film showing the events on the American side realistically."
tt0172495,"This was an interesting story, but historically was a little bit mixed up. It combines figures from different points in Roman History.  The real General Maximus was declared emperor after conquering Britain, by his troops and some locals. He then went to  Germany entered an alliance with the Emperor of the Eastern Empire.   He then attacked the Western empire and emperor Gratian and Gratian was killed in battle. Maximus ruled some of the northern and western provinces for a few years and then decided to invade Italy and took over the whole Western Empire for a year or so, then got into a war with the Eastern empire, and lost, and was executed. Marcus Aurelius was an interesting emperor, but he lived 200 years earlier.  His chief general in Germany was Avidius Cassius, who usurped him a couple of years before he died, and the conflict forced him to appoint Commodus as joint emperor several years before he died. Commodus went insane, (possibly due to lead poisoning), and was eventually strangled by a gladiator as part of an assassination plot by his sister and his own cabinet. Enjoy the movie, but try to keep it in historical perspective."
tt1375666,"This movie was terrible. It tried to be something ground breaking and emotionally challenging, but fell terribly short on all fronts, starting with the basic premise. I am expected to believe that a group of people smart enough to construct an elaborate plot involving breaking into other people's dreams are not smart enough to reunite a man with his family without getting stopped at customs? That's stupid. Fly to Mexico and walk. Or fly the kids to you. This giant plot hole is unfathomably stupid, as is most of the dialogue in this two and a half hour nightmare. I think my personal favorite line in the movie was when DiCaprio's character told his dream wife that he could not do her justice because he could not remember all of her perfections and all of her imperfections. You can't have both stupid. This movie is probably mindblowingly deep and meaningful if your education stopped in grade school, but if you have a least a GED, don't waste your ten bucks."
tt0313792,"This is not a fun movie. I feel like Woody might have been grumpy or particularly pessimistic when he wrote this film. Jason Biggs' character is weak throughout the entire film, to the point that he is hard to watch. Christina Ricci's character is disloyal and cruel. Because the characters lack any depth, the writing becomes predictable.Like a few other of his less-inspired projects, Woody felt the need to awkwardly crowbar a character for himself into this film. The age difference between Woody and Jason Biggs is rather off-putting and Woody seems out of place. Although Woody had insightful things to say, the film would have been more focused had a couple of those lines been given to another role, and the David character been removed completely.I won't watch this again.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:Acting: 1/1;Casting: 1/1;Directing: 1/1;Story: 0.5/1;Writing/Screenplay: 0.5/1;Total Base Score = 4Modifiers (+ or -): None.Total RealReview Rating: 4."
tt0816692,"The movie did not need to be almost three hours long...this was a great example of why it is a bad choice to let a director have the last say over edits, cuts, and length of a film. So many scenes could have been cut.The only interesting part of the film was when the characters finally made it to different planets. However, all the science leading up to the adventure of going to different galaxies seemed to be a lot of mumbo-jumbo...lots of theories and big words to confuse the audience so that we think it could be possible.The last thirty minutes almost was incomprehensible...the explanations of what happened in the earlier part of the film didn't make sense...but because it was explained with a serious voice talking and serious music behind it, people who don't understand quantum physics (which are most of us) will think it does.Plese Hollywood, reign in Christopher Nolen a bit."
tt0172495,"Gladiator is the best epic war film. Gladiator has the best war scenes I've ever scene. Better than Troy and much better than Alexander. I liked the digital effects in Gladiator. Troy and Alexander are pretty fun to watch, but in Alexander, i really want to forward it to exciting scenes, like war sequences. Gladiator, I can just sit there and watch it, because if you miss a part, you won't get it. The end was great, i really liked it. It was the best fight scene at the end. Every part kept me interested and there wasn't one part that bored me. It had one of the best endings ever.

tt0114369,"Two very different films about serial killers ruled Hollywood in the 1990s: 1991's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, featuring Anthony Hopkins as the infamous Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter, and this, David Fincher's masterpiece about a pair of New York cops tackling a perverted killer inspired by the seven deadly sins. SE7EN is an extremely stylish film that ended up inspiring dozens of copycats like RESURRECTION and THE BONE COLLECTOR: all of the films share a gritty-grimy style with depictions of unflinching violence, seedy backdrops and sleazy characters.Whichever way you look at it, SE7EN is a great movie. It has a pair of sterling performances from relative newcomers Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, playing stock clich√©d characters: the young rookie and the older, wiser cop on the verge of retirement. Both Pitt and Freeman overcome their characters' conventions to make them believable people. Their quarry is Kevin Spacey, giving one of his traditionally disturbed portrayals as a sociopath with no inklings of good or evil. Much of the film is made up of police procedural elements, with the investigation of crime scenes, the following of leads and at least one fantastic chase sequence halfway through in which Fincher's direction is top notch. It's also blessed with a gruesomely dark twist ending which stays in your head forever afterwards.For what it's worth, I'd pick SE7EN over SILENCE every time."
tt0260522,"Really a great movie, is a Remake of the 1973 film, based on a book of the same name from the beginning of the twentieth century. A great adventure of a Polish family in the middle of Africa, amid confusions in the period of wars between a descendant of an old Arabic religion in the Sudan, English and African natives. 
The scenes, the colors, the animals, the action is very good, the movie is fast (despite having almost 2 hours)
We take into account that director ""Gavin Hood"" is great, this African director also directed a movie called T s o t s i - 2005
This film is majestic, creative, fun to watch with your family, with your children, but very difficult to find, I practically have not found anywhere to buy or watch, I had to watch a bad quality version with subtitles alternating between English and French. But at last I understood everything calmly, and it is really a great production. I would say that it looks a lot like Lawrence of Arabia (1962), for showing the survivor in the middle of the desert and the lack of water and also show the Arab peoples of the desert. I recommend, to enjoy the story, the beautiful colors, the very serious actors with their roles, this is all very good, enjoy

tt0167260,"Though certainly an improvement upon the second film in this already classic trilogy, I must say I am shocked that of all the incredible films I could name right off the top of my head that could be sitting in the fifth position in IMDb's list of Top 250 Highest Rated Films, this is the one that's sitting there. I know I'm quite tardy in my viewing of this movie, and I've known of its sky-high praise for the four or five years it's been in release, and I thought that even though the subject matter, as I explained in my reviews of the preceding two Lord of the Rings films, is not my cup of tea, I would see what everyone else sees in these movies. I was very fond of the first one, I was grateful when I saw the ending credits of the second one, and though I found myself entertained more than the second one by the third one, I was even more grateful when the final credits arrived. I will start with what I liked: The battle sequences in this film were much better than the ones in its predecessor. I thought the second film's battles were lame and this time around, they had a lot of intensity, and I found myself drawn in. Where I found myself riveted was during the climax, the fate of the ring to be determined on a coarse cliff over molting lava, and everything unexpected happens and all of the present characters in the scene have tension that finally culminates and releases, and I finally truly found myself caring about the ring, even if it doesn't make sense that Shalob can stink Frodo through a supposedly impermeable vest.But now, let's get down to brass tacks about the denouement. I have never seen a movie that ends as many times as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. After awhile, I was counting the ""final"" scenes. Counting! Then, I found myself shocked that I had given up on counting. Who counts endings to one movie? I cannot stand a badly paced film. I've always thought of directors like Peter Jackson as directors who are particularly good at keeping a brisk pace, no matter how long the movie is. But, not only do his endings lag in this single film, but they are plagued further by two horrible things: 1) Every time one ending closes, it fades out and the screen remains black for several seconds. Then it fades up again, having fooled you and the interest that causes you to stay with a film to the end has left. This happens every-single-time-the-movie-makes-you-think-it's-ending. 2) After awhile, this series of endings becomes intensely contrived and meaningless. We don't need to see most of the things that happen! And if Jackson still wants us to see what happens to these characters, as these things must in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, he should pace it better so that it does not feel stretched, tacked on, or contrived. Perfect way to achieve this: Get rid of the deceptive fade-outs!I enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring, and I suppose the last two films had their moments, but all I can say is that I am glad that I'm finished with this trilogy and that I don't have to worry about seeing them ever again."
tt0133093,"Despite some plot holes, and recurring to ""the chosen one"" explanation, Matrix is certainly a classic action movie from the 90's. It boasted some extraordinary effects and action scenes at the time, making it one of the best movies of the genre. It is worth watching.However, this movie created a new fashion in action movies of exaggerated fight scenes, explosions, and indiscriminate special effects with very poor stories that ruined the action genre until today."
tt0110912,"I am not that satisfied. The worst thing is that this movie is old and too long, waste of time. It's not the worst, but definitely not even close to top 250 movies as far as I am concerned. There are far better, more emotional, with better story, and more teaching, and more positive movies. This looks like some random presence of mess, crime, drugs, lust, relationships, skills, and religion. Yeah, there is confidence in actors, but most in form of talk. Talk dominates, and no purpose in watching it. Most of it is boring. Unfinished, without purpose, too random events, that is how I would describe it. But does not even motivates me to even think what would happen, since even before that it was nothing happening mostly. Some random typical but negative twists of scenarios."
tt0268200,An exciting movie with twists and turns that keep you glued to the screen. Dutcher does an excellent job interweaving the suspense with the religious tones of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons).
tt0111161,"I can't help but feel emotional every time I see this film. Both Robbins and Freeman are excellent, and the supporting cast is good enough not to screw anything up, but they aren't spectacular.One of the few complaints I have about the film is that it does get slow at times, and I find myself becoming a little bored. Another complaint I have is I wish the makers of Shawshank would give credit where credit is due for the amazing amount of scenes and ideas taken from Escape From Alcatraz, starring Clint Eastwood. How can so many critics claim that Instinct is derivative while none of them mention the fact that Shawshank Redemption is one of the most derivative movies of all time? Shawshank is significantly better than Alcatraz, and it does have important emotional elements that Alcatraz is void of; but a theft is a theft, and that won't change unless the makers of Shawshank start giving credit to Alcatraz. Here are some of the things stolen:The digging tool being kept in a carved out bible and the somewhat funny irony that that entails.The rapist encountering the star in the showers near the beginning of the film to set up further encounters.An inmate at mealtime asking the star whether he will be eating something and then pulling out a small animal. I'm sure most Shawshank lovers thought that the whole bird thing was a completely original symbolic idea. Sorry, but even though the symbolism is well taken, it was FAR from original. The whole idea probably started with the mealtime animal scene, as it was obviously a direct steal.The digging debris being emptied out of the star's pants during strolls.The star befriending the black guy who can get you anything. True, Red is a much more important character in Shawshank, but considering how much was stolen, this certainly was too.There are several others that I have forgotten, as I have not seen Escape from Alcatraz in quite awhile. And if Instinct had any clich√©'s, Shawshank certainly did, with the evil warden, the evil guard, the religion, the ""highly intelligent"" star, and the concentration on the ""hole"", where the star is always sent to burn for a while.Despite all of this, I really do like Shawshank Redemption and will probably watch it many times in the future, but it absolutely amazes me that I have not seen or heard one single critic mention the robbery here. And as people became critic-following sheep with Instinct, they certainly did with Shawshank.Jeremy Barger http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/firegodsmovieclub"
tt0816692,"Let me preface this by stating that I am a big Christopher Nolan fan. Following the success of his ""Dark Knight"" trilogy, plus standalone movies ""Inception"" and ""The Prestige"", we have something of a one-man franchise. Warner Bros signed off on the biggest pre-approved budget in movie history to make ""Interstellar"" without even seeing a script.Going into the movie, I knew that with this kind of creative freedom, there were always going to be a couple of self-indulgent bits and perhaps a few ideas and sequences that the producers would have viciously vetoed with a less powerful director at the helm. But I didn't mind. In today's remake and reboot happy Hollywood, I sat back to enjoy what might be the last movie in a quite a while with an A-list director, completely original story, and a money-no-object budget.Which is why I'm sorry to report that this movie just didn't work for me at all. The problem is that it's not really a movie. It's about three different kinds of movie mixed together, into one very complex but rather indigestible dish. This same approach worked for ""The Dark Knight"", where Nolan threw everything but the kitchen sink into the screenplay and somehow made it all work. Unfortunately, lightning hasn't struck twice for Interstellar. Nolan's intergalactic juggernaut struggles to get off the ground, and when it's finally up there, doesn't really know what to do with itself. Sort of similar to the real space programme.The film opens fairly slowly, mostly in a dusty Midwestern farming community. No problem, in theory - ""Star Wars"" and ""Superman"" both openedlike this, and both were great movies. Then lots of talking heads pop up, like in a documentary. Then, they vanish, and we find ourselves in the middle of what feels like a Depression-era movie with a single father struggling to raise two wayward children on his own.We get a little background on this dystopian world. Big food shortages have created wars, crises, and the government can't afford frivolities such as a space program. Apparently, the Earth is dying, with the atmosphere rapidly becoming unbreathable. Also, there is a drone aircraft flying around - from India, of all places.Then, a ghost, which is actually gravity, communicates with Cooper's daughter by speaking to her by arranging books into barcodes and tells them to go to a secret (fully funded and operational) NASA base which has been hidden from society for decades behind a wire fence in a cornfield. I guess that must be some wire. Space wire. NASA wire.If none of this sounds like it makes any sense, it's because it doesn't. Without a clear direction, Interstellar falls apart. It continues to throw the most disjointed, jarring plot elements lifted from every epoch of space movie our way for the next two and a half hours in what could loosely be called a 'story'. There are bits that feel like ""Gravity"" with super-realistic spaceflight sequences. There are bits that feel like 1960s Star Trek where the famously doomed ""redshirts"" are sent down to random planets to die in slightly comical accidents. If you're detecting a bit of a clash of tone here, then congratulations: Nolan didn't. The unexpectedly mad, undisciplined screenplay continues to ricochet around until the very end, which plays like a cross between ""Inception"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""It's not just the plot which has developed mild schizophrenia either: the feeling extends to the characters. Brand (Anne Hathaway) is introduced as a scientific, hard-nosed foil to Coopers' wild, seat-of- the pants pilot. The movie has a nasty habit of forgetting about her, and she wanders in and out of proceedings to no avail. Then it's revealed that she's in love with an offscreen character who we have never met.All throughout this, we are flicking back and forth between equally weird and random plot developments on Earth. Cooper has left a son and daughter behind. We spend quite a lot of time with the younger daughter (Mackenzie Foy) but then she grows up, becomes a quantum physicist - not bad for a farm hand - and is basically a completely different character, which means all the time the movie spent on the young version is ultimately wasted. Cooper seems to completely forget he has a son as well - we only see him pining for the daughter.It's very important for a film to do is establish its tone and what kind of movie it is within its first ten minutes. Interstellar couldn't do this for two hours. It could have ended in a musical number and it wouldn't have made any more or less sense.I also found myself wondering what they managed to spend the enormous budget on. Take away the A-list actors and there's no reason that this couldn't have been done for $30m. Some of the effects (example: when Mann tries to dock with the Endurance) are actually pretty flimsy. They didn't look or move like real spacecraft at all.For me, the ultimate irony with Insterstellar is that it had two or three ideas which could have been developed into good movies on their own: for example, the idea of an former astronaut having to convince skeptical authorities on an impoverished future Earth that their only chance of survival is a wildly risky space expedition. For better or worse, there is no way Inception would ever have been made without Nolan's involvement. This is the great two-edged sword of creative freedom. I just hope Nolan doesn't become the last ever director to wield it."
tt0110912,"This is a very boring movie. The way that the storyline is cut up into 4 different parts makes the movies feel all very disconnected. The film basically just showcases the lives of your average mobster type criminals. Many people say that the ""everyday life"" kind of feel of the movie is what makes it great; I say very plainly that this is what makes it dull. It certainly a well made movie, this is why I give it 6 and not less."
tt0133093,"The Matrix is quite possibly the lamest cultural phenomenon since The Blair Witch Project. It's all polish and no substance. Frankly I don't find any redeeming qualities to this film franchise at all.Lots of big flashy fight sequences with no context. Lots of high-tech special effects with no character. Lots of plot complexity with no heart.I plain and simply do not get what all the fuss was about.And it took me multiple tries to watch this film end-to-end without falling asleep in the middle. The whole sequence of Morpheus teaching Neo about the Matrix put me to sleep every time.Horribly overrated. In ten years people will look back on this and say ""what in the world was I thinking?""4 out of 10.Barky"
tt1130884,"From the look of the trailer, Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" looks more like a horror film¬Ö This is a dangerous place where isolation rules under fascist control. A U.S Marshall is sent to an asylum to investigate a missing patient but discovers so much more. A demon? A ghost? Something more? Is this going to be as disappointing as I think it is?I was skeptical walking into the theater, wondering if this twist could hold water. The film starts with Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck, standing on a ferry. They talk about their assignment. What's suspect here is that there is no additional development. We are bam, smack right into the story without so much as an opening montage. All that we see is the men smoking a couple cigarettes. Though this is what begins as momentous development. As our hero smokes we that this isn't the glorified top lit smoking of a beauty or that of a sophisticated and confident gangster. We see that this is a harsher character with poor posture, someone who doesn't sleep well, someone with a deep pastThey are greeted at the gate by guards whose attitudes' seem immediately suspect. Soon we meet Dr Crawley, a seemingly complex and modern man who runs the asylum. However, he soon turns uncooperative with the investigation. Inmates and staff are hiding something but what? Everyone here seems off. Evidence and clues begin to appear but not before our hero seems riddled by psychosis himself. ""You act like all this madness is contagious."" Daniels says to the guard. Is it? Soon we begin to wonder, too, but not before he uncovers the tip of the iceberg and it's not only painfully intimate with his own past but also a mass conspiracy. The Nazis had concentration camps and the Americans have Shutter Island.Though, it doesn't stop here, but to say anything else would do the story injustice¬Ö Kingsley is in his finest role in years. Similarly, DiCaprio reaches new levels. Amongst others Elias Koteas, Ted Levine, Michelle Williams, all play small but wonderful roles. Robert Richardson captures a world all of its own.While Scorsese is a master of film I'd say that his specialty has been more character than story. This is a fresh balance of both. It's a mix of noir and thriller. It's only sort of a horror movie and could be compared to ""The Shining"" but it makes it look like it's a one trick pony.All this praise being said it's not for everyone. The story is complex. It takes some attention. At times it's a bit bleak and dire. Of course it all makes a little less sense when you actually think about it but then again that's film. There are a couple of moments where the story gets lost within itself. Things become a bit too complicated. At this point you might begin to lose faith in its viscosity, but don't worry because the story has you right where its put you."
tt0848228,"a rating of 8.8 on IMDb made me think this movie must be really fantastic, but it is not...weak plot, boring during the first 1.5 hours, no introduction to the characters, only the end gives a bit of what i actually expected. maybe it is because i am not a too huge comic fan, or that i had only seen hulk and Thor before (which i actually really liked), it was a really disappointing show. also the film appeared to be very dark with the 3D glasses on and i was not the only one in the audience who had a hard time staying awake. as other reviewers mentioned as well the different size of hulk in various scenes is a bit irritating. overall i had expected a lot more."
tt1130884,"I am very confused on why exactly this has an 8.2/10 but whatever. Don't get me wrong this is a decent film. DiCaprio phones it in a little which sucks especially compared to Mark Ruffalo's overacting. Ben Kingsley does a great job though. Same with Max Von Syndrow who played the German doctor. He was clearly inspired by Casper Gutman in the 1941 noir ""The Maltese Falcon"" starring Humphrey Bogart and directed by John Huston. Just listen to the way he talks. ""My sir, you have excellent defensive mechanisms"" compared to Gutman's ""My sir, you are a most headstrong individual."" As far as neo-noirs go, their are many better ones. However, I would probably recommend Shutter Island."
tt0848228,"I am a firm believer that every film should be able to stand on its own.This was a heavy action packed movie. The fight scenes were well choreographed, and the CGI was well done. The script cast some stellar characters with interesting backgrounds.In theory this movie should have been tailored to my liking.Unfortunately...I spent the first half of the movie dead bored and wondering how much was left. What this film lacked was character. We didn't see any depth of character. It doesn't matter that the actors or actress showed great facial expressions (reactions), their character was never explored beyond that. They remained flat, personable characters.And yes, I did read the arguments all over the internet: ""That's what the other movies were for. They showed character. Go watch those."" This leads me back to my first statement. It doesn't matter if it's already been done in a preceding movie. I expect to be wowed in THIS movie.To me, this movie came off as melodramatic.I was the wrong audience for this film.Recommends it for: Marvel fans; action-superhero genre fans."
tt0114369,"Se7en is a nerve-jangling thriller, hauntingly shot by visionary director David Fincher, who crafts one of the most iconic films of all time.Se7en tells the tale of a grisly serial killer who is twisted on delivering a sermon against modern depravity. He murders his victims to atone for the sins he deems them to have committed; his crimes echo the seven deadly sins namely gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, pride, wrath and lust. Tracking this gruesome killer (played with a quiet insanity that makes your flesh crawl, by an actor par excellence ‚Äì no spoilers here!) is a clich√© pair of cops. There's the jaded veteran Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman who brings great depth and dignity to the part) who is in the last week of his employ with the police department. Partnering him is a young, eager-to-kick-some-evil-butt cop Detective Mills (Brad Pitt whose callowness works perfectly for his character). After killing an overweight man by force-feeding him to death in the name of gluttony and bleeding to death a lawyer for greed, the anonymous killer is now turning his attention to the five remaining deadly sins. As the two men investigate, the gulf between their respective world-views begins to inform everything about how they respond to the savagery of these crimes.It is impossible to deny the potency and artistry with which Fincher executes the material. Although very little of each murder is shown, the director expertly allows suggestion to lead the appalled viewer towards the truly cataclysmic climax. Fincher's sepia-toned gloom successfully lends the film the knock-out punch it intends to. Purposely draining his landscapes of color, and setting all the tense action against rain-washed streets and under-lit interiors, Fincher evokes an atmosphere of nightmarish proportions as he unfolds a gripping tale of urban horror.Se7en is riveting in a gut-twisting way. It plays out at an engaging pace destined to entrance you with its abject horror. The film is as dark and brutal as a film can be, without showing much actual violence. Most of the stuff in the film is implied, but it's so damn disturbing that you feel like you actually saw it. And that is the beauty of Se7en!"
tt0468569,"""The Dark Knight"" is the most anticipated movie of the summer, partly because it's Nolan's follow-up to the fiercely adored ""Batman Begins"" and partly because it features Heath Ledger's last performance, as the Joker. That makes one good reason to see it. As much as I disliked ""Batman Begins,"" finding myself not just unmoved but bored by its alleged darkness and moral complexity, I concede that it was at least a real movie, with a thought-out structure, a reasonable degree of character development and, most significant, an adherence to visual logic that was at least workmanlike. ""The Dark Knight"" offers the same degree of murkiness, both visually and thematically, and maybe even a little more. And Nolan gives us enough multilayered subplots to at least fool us into thinking this is a work of intellectual and moral complexity. But as a piece of visual storytelling, from shot to shot, ""The Dark Knight"" is a mess. Characters disappear from one locale and show up inexplicably in another, thanks to the magic of editing. At one point, we learn two characters have been abducted, but Nolan doesn't bother to show us who did it or how. (Later, he explains the ""who did it"" with dialogue -- the lazy way.) At the end, a major character is left hanging, literally, as we are figuratively. If this is genius, give me hackery But ""The Dark Knight"" looks as if it were made from a messy blackboard diagram with lots of circles, heavily underlined phrases (""Duality! Good vs. evil -- in the same person! Kinship between hero and villain!"") and crisscrossing arrows that ultimately point to nothing. With ""Batman Begins,"" Nolan assured his audience that he understood that the characters originally created by Bob Kane -- and further developed by the likes of Frank Miller -- were rich, fascinating ones, and they are: It shouldn't be hard to write good stories around them. But what the Nolans have come up with here is just more pretentious poot, dumped onto the screen in a style that pretends to be fresh and energetic but is really only semicoherent. This time, Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne finds himself involved in a romantic rivalry with the handsome and extremely principled Gotham D.A., Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who has taken up with Batman's onetime love, assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes. Katie Holmes, who played Dawes in ""Batman Begins,"" has used her newly found Scientologist shape-shifting capabilities to morph into Maggie Gyllenhaal, and the effect is pleasing: Gyllenhaal's Dawes is a tough cookie in a Stanwyck-style bias-cut gown, and the movie feels smarter and more supple when she's on-screen.Many of the characters from the first movie return here, busying themselves in this or that corner of the plot with little or no consequence: Morgan Freeman is back as the tweedy genius Lucius Fox; Michael Caine, as Alfred, miraculously gives the movie's overserious dialogue some genuine dramatic heft; and Gary Oldman as Lt. Jim Gordon (he's not yet commissioner), so terrific in ""Batman Begins,"" seems lost here -- in one scene, his enunciation was so bad I wondered if he wasn't just trying to underplay the movie's self-important dialogue. (That dialogue includes choice pseudo-topical sound bites like ""Some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. Some men just want to watch the world burn."") Nolan moves his characters around the screen, in jagged diagonals and crazy swoops, in an attempt to explore the dark side of human nature. We get robber-clowns in scary masks, Batman look-alikes committing evil deeds, troupes of urban villains that come in all colors and sizes. A lot of stuff is blown up. The violence is swift and brutal -- including a pretty nasty trick involving a pencil -- although Nolan tastefully (and wisely) cuts away sharply at the crucial moments. There's an assortment of perspective shots that create the illusion we're looking -- or falling -- down from the top of some extremely tall buildings. To encourage thoughtful beard stroking among his audience, Nolan throws in a ""Lifeboat""-style (Who should die first? Me or the other guy?) plot device.There's no dramatic arc in ""The Dark Knight"" -- only a series of speed bumps. The moments in the movie that should be the most dramatic are glanced over so quickly that we barely have time to register what has happened. I'm not sure the actors know what's going on, either. Bale was a tolerable Batman the first time around, even though he ultimately failed to dissolve the distance between us and that mask. Here, he tries to build on that earlier performance. In ""The Dark Knight,"" Batman is misunderstood and mistrusted by the people of Gotham, who see him as a vigilante and not a hero who strives to protect them. Bale is slightly better as Bruce Wayne -- he's such a good actor that he's capable of conveying the deepest anguish in a single, flashing blink. But his Batman, lumbering through the movie in a suit that's supposed to be lighter than previous incarnations, is a flat, dull creature, with no new tricks up his gauntlets: Playing this moody superhero, Bale has run out of shades of gray to work with.Ledger's performance is unsettling and difficult to watch, partly because it's impossible to remove it from the context of his death. But it's a fine performance regardless, and I wish the movie around it were more deserving. ""The Dark Knight"" may be somebody's idea of a masterpiece, but I doubt it would be Hitchcock's. Nolan may want us to believe in the darkness that lurks within each of us, but instead of leading us to it visually, he chops it up and sets it out in front of us, a grim, predigested banquet. The difference between Nolan and his idol is that Hitchcock demanded that we trust ourselves; Nolan demands that we trust only him."

tt0172495,"Gladiator has become an icon of the 21st century of cinema. The film tells the story of Maximus (Russell Crowe), a former Romanian general turned slave and then gladiator, sets on a journey to avenge the death of his wife and son. Betrayed by the conspiring emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus must endure the brutal nature of the Colosseum and will stop at nothing until he's received his revenge.You can judge this film by so many different aspects. Just by the year this was made and the set pieces they were aiming to bring to life, I think they did a good job. The battle sequence in the beginning of the film is filled with extras and little use of CGI which to me is incredible. To orchestrate a set piece like this has got to be very difficult and yet they were able to achieve an exhilarating scene that really shows you the capabilities of the Roman Empire.Something about this sequence that bothered me and unfortunately continues throughout other fighting scenes is the shaking camera. It happens more in closeups as a means to give more realism to the scene. What it ultimately does, at least for me, is turn the scene all blurry, not being able to comprehend what's going on and miss out on what otherwise is a gut wrenching duel.I don't think I need to expand on the acting. There is a reason Russell Crowe won an oscar for his performance and Jouaquin Phoenix was nominated. The rest of the cast brings out some of their best performances as well.As for the score and direction, Hans Zimmer brings to life the empire that was Rome. With a thrilling score that keeps your heart beating fast and shifts the emotion of the different plot points. I think this is one of Ridley Scott's best films. I saw a good chunk of his films and other than ""The Martian"" and ""The Last Duel"" (both terrific) Gladiator is honestly a work of art.This film has gore, grittiness, drama, suspense and action. It serves as a time piece of the Roman Empire, investing time and care to thoroughly map out every single detail there is. The runtime is just over two and a half hours.This film has gore, grittiness, drama, suspense and action.

tt0215427,"Maybe in 90s it was good TV series but when I've seen it in somewhere 2010 it was really boring, sorry."
tt0468569,"I suppose many people might be offended by the simple suggestion that this movie could be anything less than ""the best movie ever"" or perhaps just ""the best movie of 2008"", that it was merely okay, for superhero action drivel.But to me, that's what it was. It's the old good vs evil thing, the good billionaire dons latex suit to fight the evil for no apparent reason other than that he's the good guy, and the bad guy being ridiculously-over-the-top so, with a similarly solid rationale. Then there is the another good guy who has to experience a biographical kink in the form of a girlfriend blown to pieces and some cosmetically challenging facial events, and he becomes the semi-good guy. Lots of explosions, pseudo- technology, vehicles driving above the speed limit, lots of fighting, the end.I never really understood the appeal of the Batman franchise, which turned a unremarkable set of comic books (uh, ""graphic novels"") into an unremarkable series of movies. Yet, many people seem to love it, and consequently another one of those hit the streets, bigger, better, more expensive, and this time with an IMDb rating that even made me curious.To be sure, there are many interesting and impressive aspects of the movie. The director, for one---I very much enjoyed Memento, and give Nolan a lot of credit for it. The cast of The Dark Knight is nothing short of impressive, with certified talent such as Caine, Ledger, Oldman, Bale, and Eckhardt. And, of course, the special effects are great, the fights are well-choreographed and fast-paced, the cinematography is excellent, and so on. It is, no doubt, a technically well-executed action flick, which I suppose is all that it wants to be, and probably all most of the people seeing it in the cinema expect it to be.But it is also other things. Overlong, for instance. The trivial comic-book plot does not sustain 150 minutes of interest, its self-indulgent repetitiveness becoming boring quickly, the little character development happening in cartoonish hit-you-over-the-head-with-hamfisted-symbolism style, the rest being fights, battles, destruction, and some more fights. The range of excellent actors that make up the cast remains woefully underused, although we do get so see some excellent acting, most notably from Ledger and Oldman. Ledger's Joker, in particular, does not require a very broad range, but it's far out in the crazy and psychopathic part of the spectrum, and Ledger manages to turn a fairly ridiculous and cartoonish villain into a three-dimensional and utterly creepy character, which is testimony to his acting ability. By and large, however, one does get the feeling that performance per talent ratio isn't a very good one, and that this crowd could have been put to better use in a more grown-up production with less of a focus on expensive action sequences.Overall, this movie is way over-hyped for what it is, it's not among the top ten movies of all time in my book, but then neither is ""Shawshank Redemption"" or ""The Empire Strikes Back"". It does have its moments, though, but it could easily be cut down to 90 minutes."
tt1853728,"This is not a spaghetti western. Django is not a superhero. It's a comedy trying to use the foil of slavery, torture, KKK to fool us into laughing.

It reminds me of a sitcom in that way; they are sometimes deadpan waiting for the canned laughter to roll in.Richard Pryor could make white people laugh at themselves. His satire was timely.

tt0068646,"I tried to watch this film a couple of years ago... since it is so hyped, and I'd never seen it before, I thought it would be worth seeing.I was wrong.Seriously, I found it hard to stay awake during the film - and eventually had to give up just over halfway through, and find something more interesting to do. This is a shame, because quite possibly it might have got more interesting towards the end - but it did not retain my interest for long enough. I did see the infamous scene with the horse's head, expecting it to be some cinematic masterpiece, but... no, even that was an anticlimax."
tt1853728,"Let us harken back to the 1960s. In America the advent of the TV western had pretty much killed off the big screen western, based on the notion that, why buy the milk when the cow is already in your living room? Meanwhile, in far-off Italy, a then-obscure director named Sergio Leone decided it would interesting to re-imagine the American western against an Italian backdrop. All the actors would speak Italian, which would later be dubbed over into the language of the country the film was playing in. Except for the main actor, who in this case was an ex-pat American named Clint Eastwood. Eastwood's TV series RAWHIDE had just cancelled and his career was effectively over. So,. when offered a few grand to be the only English-speaking actor in a ""spagetti western"" Eastwood agreed, and then forgot the experience. Until he later heard that the film, A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, had become the #1 film in Europe. But that is yet another story for yet another day... The original film DJANGO was one of the literally dozens of knock-offs of the Leone films, which (as said) were themselves knockoffs of American westerns. It starred Franco Nero, an Italian actor who spoke no English. It was hardly a prime example of the genre. It was hardly a prime example of anything. The more interesting story, a story that will fascinate film historians in the years and decades to come, is why one of the most honoured and respected film-makers on the planet today, a man whose work is actually studied in FILM SCHOOL, felt compelled to do a remake of one of the most forgettable films in the history of the medium...? This reviewer (who, by the way, considers Spagetti Westerns from the 60s a ""guilty pleasure"" - and has actually seen almost all of them in a real theatre, with a special preference for the ones starring Lee Van Cleef) could barely make it more than half way through Django Unchained, before being overcome by nausea and an overwhelming sense of loss for the way in which these resources might have been better deployed, perhaps in a parallel universe where ""QT"" is still able to pass an ink-blot test. Make no mistake. This is not fine film-making. This is a cry for help."
tt0102926,"Not so long ago, I was involved in a debate to decide what the best film of all time was. Not necessarily my favourite or the most re-watchable, but just the best film. Somehow, after a drink, a few arguments and a lot of contemplation, I singled out The Silence of the Lambs. The question remains though... was I actually onto something?The Silence of the Lambs follows agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is desperate to apprehend the serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). To try and help her gain insight into the mind of a psychopath, the aspiring agent must consult the genius, yet sinisterly manipulative psychiatrist turned cannibal, Doctor Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins). From the very first scene, Silence of the Lambs' genius is obvious. During the opening credits, with eerie music displaced on top, the camera follows Clarice, with almost stalker-like intent, as she completes a training course in an initially empty forest. This immediately founds a cruel feeling of fear, dread and unease that continues to build throughout the film... though there are noticeable spikes during any visits to the film's most infamous character.Hannibal Lector - ""A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti.""The Silence of the Lambs is one of three films in history to win the big 5 awards at the Oscars (best picture, actress, actor, screenplay and director) and the reason for those wins is thanks in large part to every and any scene involving Clarice's interaction with the eponymous Hannibal Lector. Imagine, Heat's diner talk, The Dark Knight's interrogation, or The Godfather's meetings. This is the level Silence of the Lamb's interviews are at. With closeups of both characters faces capturing their psychological chess game in exquisite detail, both actors are at the top of their games and refuse to provide respite for their entranced audience. Jodie Foster perfectly encapsulates the intelligent, ambitious yet emotionally delicate Starling who along with Anthony Hopkin's now iconic portrayal of the psychopathic Lector create a pairing so iconic that their interactions have been parodied to no end (references range from The Batman to Stranger Things to even Tom and Jerry).Hannibal Lector - ""And what did you see, Clarice? What did you see?""Clarice Starling - ""Lambs. The lambs were screaming.""Commonly touted alongside Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley as one of the all-time-best movie heroines, Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling is an icon. Whilst this is largely down to the captivating performance at the heart of the film, another crucial reason is how the director (Jonathon Demme) frames our protagonist. Throughout the film, the camera will occasionally position itself in Clarice's point of view. This means that whoever Clarice is talking to (serial killer or otherwise) will often stare directly down the lens and thus directly at the audience. This allows viewers to become a pseudo-psychologist themselves and deduce the intentions and thoughts of multiple characters in Clarice's periphery. Furthermore, this technique also forces audiences to identify with Clarice, as she navigates a case that, due to her age, gender and position, involves all eyes being on her.Jack Crawford - ""Starling, when I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you didn't it? It was just smoke, Starling. I had to get rid of him.""Clarice Starling - ""It matters, Mr Crawford. Cops look at you to see how to act. It matters.""Thankfully, to match the astounding performances at the heart of the film, The Silence of the Lambs bolsters a captivating, quick-paced and unbearably suspenseful story spread across a 2-hour runtime. By using the conversations with Hannibal almost like beginnings of a chapter, the film signposts where the story is heading, without giving any of its delicious twists away. This feat is even more impressive as Lector himself is only on screen for 24 minutes and 52 seconds, yet the pacing is so exquisite that his absence is never truly felt. Furthermore, the hunt for Buffalo Bill serves to keep both the audience and Clarice on their toes. By drip-feeding revelations surrounding Bill's psyche and own particular brand of horror, a sense of trepidation, tension and terror is expertly raised throughout the film. This then reaches a crescendo where, after a clever misdirect, Clarice finally confronts Bill in what has to be one of the most suspenseful battles ever put to screen. Does anybody breathe when the lights turn out?Clarice Starling - ""He won't come after me.""Ardelia Mapp - ""Oh really?""Clarice Starling - ""He won't. I can't explain it... He - he would consider it rude.""With a haunting score, powerful performances and exquisite pacing, The Silence of the Lambs personifies everything a psychological thriller should be. It is thematically rich, touching on overt and covert sexism, childhood trauma and the philosophy behind serial killers all while brimming with endlessly quotable dialogue, a lightning-fast pace and iconic characters. Honestly, I doubt many could argue with The Silence of the Lambs' status as both a classic for its genre as well as the medium of film as a whole. However, although not everyone may agree with it being the best film of all time, after a rewatch, I'd willingly fight anyone who claims it isn't close."
tt0372784,"To tell the truth, I thought the Batman franchise could never be saved, and I was really let down that I may never see my favorite superhero in a good movie ever again. Then I saw the preview to Batman Begins, I didn't really know what to think. New Batman. New Alfred. New story. New style. I wasn't sure why I wanted it 'the old way', but maybe I wanted to the actors in the Batman films I grew up with, to revive themselves and make a good Batman movie. I wanted Robin and sadly, Batgirl, alongside Batman saving the world from another familiar villain.I heard Batman Begins, and I thought great, this was called ""Batman"" in 1989, selfishly I said, ""I want something new!"".But, of course being a big Batman fan, I went opening night to Begings. 2 and half hours later, like the rest of the audience was completely blown away. It was the only movie I had ever been to (and yes I have been to some great ones) where the crowd claps and the end. This was not just golf claps for a popcorn clip, this was a standing ovation for 10:30 pm show in a crowded theater in Austin, Texas.I never would have thought this would have worked, even with Nolan directing. But I was wrong, so wrong. After seeing the X-Mens and Spidermans, I clearly thought Marvel had the upperhand and DC was just simply trying to keep up, again, so wrong.Nolan gave us a dark, gritty, and pleasantly realistic, view of Batman. Bale gives a tremendous performance as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Michael Caine was a fabulous Alfred, and Morgan Freeman almost stole the show as Luscious Fox.Even though X-Men and Spiderman(all of them) are wonderful superhero movies, Batman Begins, is just a good, no, great movie. And I think that is what blew people away, that it wasn't just some superhero, special effect, hero gets girl, good guy wins movie, it was a truly dark and well crafted movie, and it maybe stupid to say, but it didn't even feel like you were watching a superhero movie.I don't even think Burton, and his animated style(which works), could have revived this troubled series, that Schumaker wrecked, because like Fantastic Four and Daredevil, tried over do it and give us the latter part of things.So, here is to you Chris Nolan. You saved a franchise. You made an unforgettable movie, that will be remembered as the best superhero movie of all time, but just an all around great and unforgettable movie classic."
tt0120737,"The entire Lord of the Rings movie trilogy is a complete travesty. I read these books when I was very young (I'm 24 now) and after watching the movies and seeing the new covers for the books, my disappointment was heightened. One of the major purposes of any work of fiction is to exercise the imagination in the form of creating images of the things in the work, especially the characters. Now, when someone reads these books after watching the movies (even The Hobbitt) the reader will have a preset image of the characters that they've seen. The Lord of the Rings is one of history's greatest series of fictional books simply because of the imagination put forth in creating an entire world to base it on; that's now basically ruined because of the movies. A good comparison would be the Dune series, which I now feel uncomfortable reading simply because I saw the Sci-fi channels presentations of the book and Children of Dune. The only reason that the movie deserves a 4 is because of the quality of it."
tt0068646,"I saw this for the first time as a teenager and was pretty bored.  At the same time I was seeing things like ""Scarecrow"" and ""Deliverance"" so its not like I was just interested in seeing juvenile nonsense.I've seen it again recently, twice.  I admire the movie, I like it, it holds my interest, I think its very good.  But I fail to understand why the imdb trolls think its the greatest thing since the invention of the lightbulb. For that reason I've rated it lower than I normally would cause you've all gone overboard in your admiration.Pacino not winning an Oscar is a huge injustice.  He makes the entire movie worthwhile and doesn't even have to talk.  James Caan is miscast.  Brando is terrific but if he didn't win, I don't think the earth would have ceased existing.  Its Pacino's movie, through and through, and someone must have agreed w/me on that, since the second one is his, too."
tt0114369,I really liked it suprisingly. Seeing it is not the type of genre I would normally watch and that I generally like but this film was really well done. It has a gripping and interesting storyline. I think the whole plot around the seven capital sins was really ingenious and made the story great. I love the beautiful dark cinematography and the screenplay is really intelligent. To add on top of that great performances from Morgan Freeman playing the detective and Brad Pitt as Mills. I also like how the film talks about a lot of murders but really not much is shown. Overall a disturbing yet really good film.
tt0137523,"""Fight Club"" is an Academy Award nominated (sound effects) movie from roughly 15 years ago starring Edward Norton (a two-time Academy Award nominee before he turned 30), Brad Pitt, Meat Loaf and Helena Bonham Carter. It's possibly the most famous movie from director David Fincher, although it's far from his best in my opinion. That does not mean it's a bad film. Not at all. However, many of the characters are simply too over the top and the film is in constant danger of surpassing the fine line between entertainment and ridiculousness. It's based on a Palahniuk novel (his most known) and the script comes from Jim Uhls, who had a surprisingly insignificant career after coming up with the words for this cult film.The dialogs are witty and almost too hip occasionally. It's not a film for easily offended people as it tends to be vulgar at times and the violence is graphic frequently, although that is certainly not a surprise with a film titled ""Fight Club"". In general, it's a pretty insane film, most of the time in a good way. The fact that two characters visit meetings of dying people, so they can feel better pretty much says it all already. I clearly preferred Norton over Pitt here and it is self-explanatory that Pitt did not get a single awards nomination for his work here. He becomes pretty much a caricature at times. Then again, his character does not really exist, so this can be used as some kind of justification I guess. The final plot twist comes unexpected and reminded me of the one in ""The Usual Suspects"", only that the main character is still unaware of his true identity. By the way, Norton looked pretty much the same age in this film as now 15 years later when he scored another Oscar nomination for his work in a Best Picture winner.The ending was pretty great though and I liked how, with the disappearance of Pitt after the gunshot, we finally see also the darker side of Norton's character when he and Bonham Carter's character watch the explosions. But how did that gunshot do so little damage? Did the pain make Pitt's character go away? Anyway, ""Fight Club"" is a good movie. Not one of my personal favorites, but an entertaining 140 minutes, during which it almost never drags. One of my favorite scenes was near the end at the police station when he gets interrogated and almost emasculated. That was pretty funny there, but also shocking at the same time. Recommended.The above was my review from February 2015 and now in summer 2022 I got the chance to give this another watch and I will just add a few thoughts here. It is almost 25 years old now and the fact that over two million people have rated it on imdb is really self-explanatory. This film has become a cult classic for sure. I will just do some brainstorming: This time, I really wanna mention Meat Loaf, who is sadly no longer with us anymore. May he rest in peace. He played a truly extravagant character here with his sports background and substance abuse that eventually resulted in him having boobs from hormonotherapy he was forced to go through to battle cancer. Interestingly enough, he survived or at least did not die of cancer as you could think he would. Meat Loaf's character is one that really could have ruined a movie with the wrong approach, but here, thanks to Fincher mostly, we have the right approach and it works. Jared Leto is also in this film with really light hair. I think platinum blonde is the term, so yeah you will find a few musicians here playing supporting characters, but Leto's screen time is really limited. I already mentioned this interrogation scene earlier and I must also say how shocking it was and yet entertaining at the same time how they said they knew he would say so because his alter ego Tyler Durden told them he would. We never really see Norton in his durdenesque state if you want to call it that, only very briefly in flashbacks when the twist is revealed. Blink and they are gone though. Like the scene in which he and Bonham Carter's character are having sex. Yep, Helena Bonham Carter was a romantic interest in this film and her character pretty much an object of desire. A bit difficult to imagine for me, but this is just personal taste. I mean Tim Burton loved her, even if their romance started a few years after this film. I also see now she has Spanish roots apparently. Okay, I did not know that.As for this film here, so I must also say that I still think the song in the end (""Where Is My Mind?"") is very good and also much older than it sounds like. Really nice way to close the film as we see catastrophe happen. This was already done by the evolved Fight Club then and it got a different name, something with ""mayhem"" it was. I did not like this change too much, even if the members uttering the rules like robots was a bit on the entertaining side from this film that is never really about comedy at all, but will still make you smile because of situational comedy here and there. On the more dramatic side, I am still struggling with the big twist in the end. Not just that Norton's character somehow survives the shot to the head or who knows in the end it seems like just no rules apply anymore, but also especially that Norton is the real Tyler Durden, even if I liked how they depicted it when we see scenes that featured Pitt before and now they feature Durden with what he says. For example towards the guy they kidnap for a brief moment and threaten to do something ugly with his testicles. Also a darkly comedic reference back to the cancer group from much earlier. Oh yeah, the words they are shouting after Meat Loaf's character dies were also kinda funny because this was exactly what Norton's character did not have on his mind and they got the message all wrong. I liked the actor/character who had only one scene, but it was a crucial scene, a barkeeper or something and he is asked by Norton's character a very important question and the barkeeper shows him his hand that takes us back to the maybe most violent scene when a destructive liquid is put on somebody's hand where it causes irreparable damage, but it was an act of friendship somehow, or an act of finding strength through suffering. In a good way even. Difficult to explain.But now, let's really go to what I wanted to talk about. The scenes early on that involved Norton's and Pitt's character. I am talking about the phone call. I am talking about when the two are on the street fighting each other violently, yet playfully, which is the moment Fight Club begins to exist and others come to watch them. Would they have come and been impressed if it was just one guy going crazy with nobody else around? Or the conversation in the airplane during the first meeting. Or when Pitt's character is driving the car and Norton's next to him. I have a hard time to acknowledge that all these scenes actually included only one character in fact. So I guess the way we see the scenes are simply the way Norton's character (his harmless side) remembers them and they did not happen at all. Not just not like this, but not at all. This could also be emphasized by the inclusion of all these voice-overs. We are really witnessing the film through his own reality that may have been completely different to the actual reality. Or sometimes even been exactly the same. We can never really say for sure. But it was also a good indicator for example that Pitt's character told Norton's to not talk about him with Bonham Carter's character. Despite the two constantly having sex from Norton's character's perspective. Or could really all those police officers in the interrogation room been part of what started as the Fight Club? Difficult to imagine, also that nobody outside was watching the action in there. Or that nobody was really following Norton's character when he ran off with a gun in his hand. So yeah, the amount of scenes in here that play with your mind is endless and maybe you will understand the film a little bit better with each viewing or maybe you won't make progress at all. That is perfectly fine too though. This film can also be enjoyed through the crassness of individual scenes and it is not necessary to grasp the concept behind the overall thing. From a personal perspective, I would also like to say that I thought it was nice to see two actors (if I am not mistaken) that later on became part of Dark Angel, one of my favorite shows ever, so they worked with Fincher here and a little later with James Cameron. I am talking about the boss at the office and also one of the cop actors it was I think.Finally, I will not change my rating now and after this watch too it will stay at a solid 3 out of 5. I saw that critics liked it much less than general audiences anyway and let's be honest this one being ranked almost inside the top10 of best films ever here on imdb according to user ratings is a gigantic exaggeration. This good it is not. There are good moments for sure, but there are also flaws and the idea that (potentially) nothing is real as everything is seen through the eyes of a very delusional man cannot justify all that happens here. The potential suicide scene of HBC's character for example I did not like too much, even if it was a bit funny what she was shouting to the officers there. A scene I did like, however, was the one when the club owner shows up and really beats up Pitt's character there and the latter is treated like a Messiah afterwards because of what he endured so that Fight Club could keep existing. It was also all just in Norton's character head I guess because the latter was not injured whatsoever in the following scenes. I did not like though that the owner agreed to let the club exist because he seemed so determined before that to end it. The framework with Pitt's Durden threatening Norton's character at gunpoint at the very start and almost at the end was also not among my favorite parts. So yeah, I give this film a thumbs-up overall. Not a must-see though."
tt0816692,"The fate of humanity rests in the hands of a small number of NASA pilots, who travel through a work hole in search of a new home.I've only watched it for the second time, the first being when it first arrived on the big screen. My opinion hasn't altered since the viewing, it's an epic masterpiece, the story holds up remarkably well, but the acting and visuals all contribute to make this film something very special.The story is remarkably good, it's cohesive, well balanced, it makes sense.Matthew McConaughey's best film role still for me, he's awesome as the lead character, superbly supported by both Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine, it really is a well made epic.The visuals, the special effects are all tremendous, and have held up as the years have gone past, it remains one of the most incredibly beautiful visual films of all time.Epic 10/10."
tt0816692,"I was ready to like this film, given his work on The Dark Knight, Memento and Inception. Of course, I was worried about the casting - McConaughey doesn't belong in an intelligent sci-fi, and Hathaway should only appear in movies doing a bad English accent in a lush period drama, but I was hoping for he best.SO we get McConaughey mumbling for literally the first hour, during the course of which almost nothing at all happens. It's so bad you have to turn the sound up. And then of course we meet Hathaway, who is to acting what Genghis Khan was to community relations. And then, implausibly, we see them sent up in a rocket to save the planet, which is followed by some nice visuals and ludicrous plotting before the end which is almost as bad as Bobby Ewing waking up in a shower. SO it was predictable, absurd, and poorly acted which leads to the question why are people falling over themselves to say how great it is? I suspect it's because McConaghey is the man of the moment, and Nolan considered a genius. Which people think mean they can do no wrong.Which is a disappointing conclusion to reach."
tt7286456,"To say it was satisfying would be somewhat misleading. Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it."
tt0114369,"First, the good bits about Se7en are its cinematography, colour palette, and the ever reliable Morgan Freeman, replete with unnecessary end-narration.His co-star, however - that's a different story.Se7en is not a very good film. And it's aged much like Salad Cream. For a taster of this just check out its schlocky film-print-like titles twinned with commercial alt-rock.Pitt has demonstrated some good acting before (Kalifornia, 1993) and after (Fight Club, 1999). Not here. Perhaps he didn't like the simpleton character he plays, or it was too underwritten, but in any case he just doesn't sell the archetype of the basic think-later masculinity the film wants to go for.There are lots of classic literary quotes in Se7en left by the serial killer (Kevin Spacey), but it all amounts to pretentiousness. It feels rather like the film wants to sell the idea of smartness. By appealing to people who identify with Pitt's basic-man: those who hold some kind of resentment for ""fag poetry"", but would dearly like to be in on it. This insults not only its audience (Pitt's character is not likable enough), but also those who are somewhat well-read. Moreover, the clumsy, out-of-place, Neo-noir atmosphere plods inconsequentially to the film's culmination: the part for which it is best remembered, its shock ending. The link between the detectives (Freeman and Pitt) and the serial killer becomes personal; but radically so, and conveniently near the end. Only for the sake of the film's surprise. This is why Se7ven just doesn't work on a whole. It's too contrived and not nearly as clever as it thinks it is.Pitt actually seems like he would rather play any other character than who he is playing, sophisticated or not. In Pitt's defense, it's likely the film still wouldn't come together even without his casting. Interestingly, there are two references made to an earlier, more skilfully made piece of art of this ilk, but Silence Of The Lambs (1991), Se7en is not. Incidentally, The Last Seduction (1994), China Moon (1994), and even The Firm (1993) are more cogent nineties noirs."
tt0133093,"""The Matrix"" is a decent and entertaining movie that is only viewed as something more than that by those who haven't seen better.The story borrows heavily from other films and tries real hard to convince it is more than your average sci-fi/action movie.  It's not.  Keanu Reeves' acting is better here than in anything he has done before or since, but that's not saying much.  He does not make a good leading man and is easily eclipsed by the supporting cast (mainly Laurence Fishburne).My suggestion is if you want to see The Matrix then see it and enjoy it, but then go out and see far superior movies like ""12 Monkeys"" or even the ""The Cell""."
tt0429078,"I really like Donnie Yen's movies, but definitely not this one. I used to hear praises for Tsui Hark's work, but certainly if his other pieces are like this one, I won't line up to be his fan. I don't like his way of directing. I don't like the script. I don't like the plot. Everything seems terribly hectic and overtly dramatic. It was very much difficult to differentiate between two village girls that were a bit of a main cast. The martial art choreographer definitely was far from awesomeness.I was hoping it would be a bit like Hero or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. But well, it was a mere hope."
tt0268200,"You know, when most people hear about this movie and they find out that writer/producer/director/star Richard Dutcher is a Mormon... and that the movie has a definite Mormon agenda... they are going to be rolling their eyes and thinking, ""That can't be any GOOD!""  (Heck, that was my own reaction initially.)  This movie is about a small Mormon town who's quiet tranquility is rocked with the seeming arrival of a serial killer in their midst.  I don't even want to say anything more about the plot lest I give something away.  Suffice to say that the movie is one of the best-written AND directed AND acted (with the exception of co-star Wilford Brimley, I don't think anyone is a ""professional"" actor) police thrillers I have seen in recent years!  And no, I'm not a Mormon!  Richard Dutcher has really done something unexpected here... by infusing a traditional thriller with an examination of faith... and emotion... and humanity... the movie works on all levels... topped off by a searing ending.  I was really blown away by this movie (though I still have no intentions of joining the Mormon Church.)"
tt1345836,"I really liked the first two. I did. It was clear from the first gratuitous, plot-crushing soliloquy of Michael Cane (there were four in total) that this was headed for disaster: a disaster that even Anne Hathaway in black latex couldn't save. There was unintelligible dialogue from everyone, especially Gary Oldman; Bane never had a chance to be understood, with that auto-tune mask set to 'distort' on his face. People around me were constantly asking, ""what did he say?"" What little action and Bat-gadgetry there was just couldn't save this bloated failure. The names 'Waterworld' and 'Indiana Jones 4' will justifiably be raised in comparison. I really liked the first two. I did."
tt0372784,"Well, it's official. Batman has gotten his balls back. This film is dark, extremely dark. So dark in fact, there are a great number of scenes filmed, I kid you not, exactly like a horror film. Now, I'm a huge fan of the ""real"" Batman movies. You know, ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" which were done by Tim Burton, starred Michael Keaton, and were carried along by Danny Elfman's rousing musical score. Let's not forget, that old Batmobile from those films. This tank-like monstrous new Batmobile may very well be the coolest car I've personally seen in a movie in ages. Of course, if you're a fan of those rather putrid, embarrassing ""other"" Batman films (Forever & Robin), then you may very well not like this movie. Because it doesn't totally suck like those films did.Basically, this is the story of how Bruce Wayne thought of, created and became Batman. In a nutshell. However, it also tells, in the most personal way, of his struggles with the concepts of justice and vengeance. It shows us how he trained to become the ultimate fighter of evil and corruption. It introduces us to a different villain from the previous four filmsand does a mighty good job of it, too. Even as a side notewe're introduced to good old Commissioner Gordonbefore he's police commissioner. So then, it also tells a bit of his ""beginnings."" We see the beginning of the Batcave and find out just how Bruce Wayne was able to, to quote the Joker, ""get those wonderful toys."" On top of it all, if you ever thought Michael Keaton was the only person who could adequately, correctly portray Batman on screen, you just may change your mind hereI never imagined Christian Bale would do such a remarkable job.Here's the breakdown:The Good:--The action is fast and brilliantly choreographed.--The dark mood is finally backthe way Batman is supposed to beit has even less ""camp"" value than Burton's films!--The Batmobile, as I said, is incredibleand has some great sound effects to boot. Supposedly, it was designed by the same person who created Keaton's Batmobile.--Christian Bale is so good, he almost causes you to forget about Kilmer and Clooneythank god!--Michael Caine's powerful performanceshe's the major player keeping Bruce Wayne's humanity in check. More so than Katie Holmes, whose performance, while good, was a tad weaker than Caine's in this respect. She did an interestingly good job as a tough lawyer, however.--Bits of comic relief here and therethat don't ruin the movie!--Brilliant atmosphere.--Excellent acting all around.--Not claustrophobically over-crammed with ""Batman"" villains like the last two films. The only major villain is the Scarecrow, and another character whom I'll leave up to you other movie goers find out.--Excellent tension.--Fantastic cinematography.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--The music is good, but for those of you out there like meyou may miss Danny Elfman's beautiful score.--Gotham City is not as Gothic as it should be. However, the film has slightly more modern twist that makes it more ""believable"" than the previous films. Especially those last two, which, if you haven't guessed it by now, I hated.--Early on, the story deals a lot with flashback sequencesa couple are a bit confusing as to where they belong chronologically. They may have indeed been chronological, but only seemed like a steady story with flashbacks. Still, it gets the point across.--The film seems to be set-up as either a new Batman series, or a prequel to Tim Burton's original Batman.

tt0848228,"This is an OK superhero flick featuring the Marvel Comics heroes Thor, Ironman, The Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow. They are assigned to protect the entire globe from Loki, the stepbrother of Thor, and an alien invasion.There are plenty of enjoyable action is this movie, helped with some slapstick humor. The action sequences, especially during the climax, were breathtaking and exciting, leaving the audience thoroughly entertained. However, the movie's main plot and story aren't very captivating or compelling, coupled with lack of chemistry and substance between the cast of characters.I would like to have seen every superhero in this movie given a more elaborative purpose and equal screen time; it appeared that Ironman was the main focus of the movie and took away most of the glory - too much emphasis was placed on the character. Robert Downey Jr. was too cocky and tried too hard to be funny in the Ironman role.Overall, this movie is just one battle scene after the other. Not much of a story here, but it's something the kids would love to watch.Grade C"
tt0108052,"Poor acting, poor direction.  Every theme cannot be made into a movie. This tragedy in our time could not.  The horror of it all is just to great to be made into something the entertain, a popcorn smacking, no-nothing about history, clue-less to suffering, average audience.  Would have been better to have left it alone."
tt0108052,"A beautifully crafted film which seems somewhat hollow at the center (as is true of many of Spielberg's films).  Though many have hailed ""List"" as being a great film, I felt that it soft-pedaled the horrors of the Holocaust. Kudos to actor Ralph Fiennes and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, however..."
tt0468569,"I'm pretty serious about this one because I love movies. And since this movie is being rated as the best movie of all time, I was expecting something that could measure itself with the great movies of all time. I expected a movie that grips you, crawls under your skin and leaves you breathless. It does none of that. It is pretentious and inconsistent. It pretends to dig deep and dark and explore themes like morality, fate, good versus evil, heart versus mind, madness versus reason, and at the same time it wants to be this big spectacular action movie. But it fails miserably. It's all just a big clumsy pretentious inconsistent mess.Yes, Ledger is good, but for his performance to really contribute to the movie, there should have been context. If the rest just doesn't feel right, it looses its potential. If you throw a diamond on a mountain of poop, it doesn't change much of the way it looks or smells. Love interest Maggie Gyllenhaal (great performance in Stranger than Fiction) produces no chemistry at all, so I wasn't really blown away when she was blown up. Editing feels weird. But most of all it was the inconsistencies that got to me. And then not just the 'practical' ones (like the inconsistent protective quality of the batman suit; or why leave an extremely dangerous criminal unrestrained with a tubby policeman in his cell ('hostage volunteer? you, tubby?'); a schoolbus is used twice to make a grand escape? - do they come with teleporter machines these days?; why would you want to ride your batmobile face down?; Batman lowers his voice to be unrecognizable, but how hard is it to follow a batmobile with a helicopter to its hiding place?), but more importantly it's crucial plot/ morality inconsistencies. Yes, the White Knight went through some traumatic experiences, but to turn to the dark side so wholeheartedly and sadistically? And then to just let the Joker (at least indirectly responsible for his trauma) walk when he only needs to pull the trigger? Oh yeah, forgot, he's Mr. Coin Toss now. But even if he is guided by blind fate now, he still determines himself who he goes after and whether it's OK to threaten to blow out the brains of little kids. And then the Big Bad criminal who throws the detonator out off the window. Ah! The Joke is on you Joker! People are not what you make them out to be. Even the baddest bad ass has a good heart. Never mind that just before when the Joker threatened to blow up a hospital unless an innocent lawyer was killed, there was a crowd with guns ready to shoot the guy within no time. Also, what with the vote on the 'good people boat'? They vote to blow up the 'bad people' (democracy at its finest) but then Nobody has the balls to do it? So they don't blow up the other boat because they think it's unjust, but because they're spineless hypocrites.I applaud movies that try and deal with complex issues like conflicting emotions or morals, but to just make a big soup of it all under the pretense of 'but that's how life works, it's conflicting ideas, feelings and actions' is just a weak excuse for the inability or laziness to produce a good consistent story. Believe me, I detest black and white thinking and applaud the exploration of the Grey area. But that's not what this movie does. Piling a bunch of random inconsistent ideas on top of each other is not equal to exploring the Grey area.The climax is the ending though (it usually is). Our dark knight has to sacrifice himself, has to live like a hunted animal in the shadow, because the People would not be able to cope with the idea of Denth doing bad things, despite his recent traumas. So it's better to LIE to the public, because they are too stupid to make up their own mind and their faith in goodness of man would be lost forever (despite the fact that they just tried to establish with the boat-thing that there's goodness even in big bad criminals). So Batman (whose enemies take advantage of the fact that he doesn't kill) takes the blame for a bunch of random killings that could have been linked to anyone - a Joker perhaps? (even if they wanted to absolve Denth from his crimes -I mean, evidence/motive would have been needed to link it to Batman too?) and goes off running ('run Forrest!') into the night to save us another day. Because you just can't trust people to make up their own mind, it's better to lie to them. It's for their own good. Great morale. Straight from the White House? But ey, why so serious?"
tt0102926,"Such a boring movie.  Not much seemed to happen until the end, which was OK. The reason behind why the guy was killing the ladies was the stupidest thing I have ever heard.  Hannibal Lecter's character and his escape scene were really the only things I liked in the whole film.  It pretty much sucked."
tt0137523,"This is one of the silliest movies I have ever seen.It is not only not credible that such clubs exist; the motivation of the characters in this film to act the way they do is simply not believable.Having said that the performances are quite good. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton always deliver consistent well rounded performances. It is unfortunate that their efforts are wasted here due to an unsatisfactory script and an incredible plot line.The ending of the film is especially unsatisfying and .... well, weird. I guess one should have expected that from the lengthy period of grief that precedes it. The performances probably rate more than a 2 rating, but I think it deserves a rap on the knuckles just in case someone wants to make Fight Club II"
tt0167261,"I have never read any of the LOTR books (and have no mind to), I am merely commenting on the film quality itself.Since the advancement of computer graphics, directors can now create the humungous, landmark battles that could only be hinted at in such films as ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  Other than that, there is the clunky conflicts of ""Spartacus"" and ""Ran"".  Do computers make this any better?  Having seen LOTR: The Two Towers, I will say ""yes, they do"".  The battle of Helm's Deep is undoubtedly one of the largest and most interesting set pieces ever created out of zeroes and ones.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie seems vapid and more focused around the big battle than in the mood for telling an engaging and developing story like ""Fellowship"" did.  Gandalf gets minimal screen time, Frodo and Sam seem totally out of place with the rest of the story, and the other Hobbits look bored for about 90% of the time.Oh well, watch this if you have time for it. I'll go back to ""Empire"" instead.Overall: !!! out of !!!!! time-wasting viewings."
tt0172495,"I am usually worried that I'm in for a big let-down when I am looking forward to a film as much as I was to this one.  This time however, I was very pleasantly suprised, when Gladiator not only fulfilled but surpassed my expectations.  It's a brilliant film, which (while containing weaknesses such as a script which wasn't quite as good as it could have been, and one climactic scene which completely changes, and ruins, the ending) manages to engage your heart and mind.The performances are without exception excellent (although the accents may distract a bit, there is such a wide variety of them).  I must single out for commendation Mr. Phoenix, who despite his youth manages to portray a character with such conviction that you never for a moment doubt his interpretation.  His physical performance is as good as his mental one.The film rests firmly on the (extremely attractive and capable) shoulders of one Russell Crowe.  In a tour-de-force performance, he manages to convey a man (not a superhuman) with frailties and doubts and fears and heart.  I cannot convey to you how brilliant this man's performance was.  If anyone else had been this character, the film would have rated at best a five out of ten.Kudos to Russell Crowe, and to Ridley Scott, for managing to keep this film on a level with humanity, rather than one in which the characters become killing machines.A must see, five stars out of five."
tt0109830,"The thing that really spoils my enjoyment of this film is the way history is re-written.Not ancient history, but history which I lived through. In real-life the anti-war protesters were venting their disapproval of what they earnestly felt was an immoral war. They took a lot of knocks from the powers that be for their troubles as well.This movie depicts them as shallow, selfish, manipulative, power-driven, and even violent people (there's irony for you!) who were ""Unamerican"" in every sense of the word.The odious message of this movie is that ignorance is bliss. Don't think about things and everything will work out nicely and you will be happy. Well at least you'll get rich - which in most American movies is close enough.It's enough to make a person gag.Oh, and the fact it beat Pulp Fiction and Shawshank Redemption to the best picture Oscar doesn't help either."
tt0108052,"My first recollection of this movie was in my early adolescence, and of all the movies I've seen that portray historical events, Schindler's list is one that evokes the greatest emotion and most memorable impression. The black and white representation provokes the feeling of desolation, and shows the seriousness of the events that took place during that era, but doesn't overshadow the brilliance of Schindler's unrelenting kindness and heroism despite all obstacles. It gives descriptive recounts of how heinously and inhumane Jews were treated, with raw and unforgiving scenes unlike those seen in most factual films. This is truly one of Spielberg's best works of art."
tt0361748,"Whenever I view a Quentin Tarantino film I expect a quirky plot, decent acting and a cool soundtrack. Unfortunately, I also expect non-existent pacing, a confusing narrative and long, drawn-out talking sequences.You get plenty of the above with his newest effort, the revenge fantasy, ""Inglourious Basterds, a remake of the 1978 Italian picture, ""Bastardi Senza Gloria"" (literally ""Bastards Without Glory""). It's ""The Dirty Dozen"" meets ""Valkyrie"" meets ""Kill Bill"" and tells the story of a small band of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers who are dropped behind enemy lines in German-occupied France and strike fear in the hearts of Hitler's military.Led by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), the group accomplishes this by raids and ambushes in which dead German soldiers are scalped (in some very gruesome scenes) and survivors have swastikas carved into their foreheads (think younger, more Teutonic versions of Charles Manson). While there are eight of these commandos, the two most interesting are Pfc. Omar ""The Bear Jew"" Ulmer (Omar), who beats Nazis with baseball bats; and Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), an ex-Wehrmacht soldier who killed a dozen of his own troops.The trailers for the movie are really pushing this plot line, but that's a false premise. There are really only a few scenes of such carnage, instead the story revolves mostly around a lisping SS colonel, Hans ""The Jew-Hunter"" Landa (Christoph Waltz, a German actor appearing in a rare U.S. production) and a French Jew, Soshanna Dreyfus (M√©lanie Laurent, a French actress appearing in a rare U.S. production), whose family Landa had killed.She owns a movie house in Paris and becomes acquainted with Frederick Zoller (Daniel Br√ºhl), a war hero who supposedly killed over 100 U.S. soldiers in Italy. A film of this exploit, ""A Nation's Pride,"" was made by Nazi Minister of Propaganda, Josef Goebbels (Sylvester Groth). Of course, the premier of this film will take place at the picture show.Also complicating matters is a British spy, Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender) who is unintentionally hilariously briefed by Michael Myers (doing his worst Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake impersonation) and Winston Churchill (Rod Taylor, ""The Time Machine,"" ""The Birds""). Then, there's another subplot which has the Fuerher himself (Martin Wuttke) possibly attending the premier.To complete these various story lines, Tarantino falls back on his habit of filming scene after scene of people sitting around tables, talking, talking and talking (see ""Grindhouse's Death Car""). Talking in taverns, talking in houses, talking in war rooms, talking in basements, talking in prisons. Mr. Tarantino, there is a person who toils on every film set that ever existed - this person called an ""editor."" Please make use of this person.These sequences swallow up about 80 percent of the movie's 2-hour, 30-minute running time and leave precious little time for Pitt, who does well, albeit with a bad Southern accent, and his mercenaries.There some good things about the film, however. The sets and costumes are wonderful and quite accurate as far as period detail goes; the location cinematography by Robert Richardson (""The Aviator,"" ""Kill Bill, Vols. 1 and 2"") is terrific; the movie uses authentic German, French and Italian (with subtitles); and Tarrantino knows his German cinema history, dropping names like Lili Riefenstahl, P.W. Pabst and Emil Jannings.A good surgeon could have removed about 45-minutes from this movie, though, added a few more scenes of the Basterds and toned down the David Bowie. Then, it might have been the taut, compelling film I thought it could be."
tt0361748,"Stupid me, I didn't even notice who the director was before I sat down to watch this really peculiar film.With the possible exception of the first segment, the film - despite what the storyline is saying - is entirely in the here and now. A fantasy of revenge played out amid - not just gratuitous - but completely surreal, graphic, sickening violence. The carnage is so over-the-top that it quickly doesn't even garner a raised eyebrow, it becomes simply wallpaper behind a really vapid, simple fairytale. And the sets and costumes, though I guess not entirely inappropriate for WWII, never feel like anything more than just what they are - sets and costumes. The ambiance being much more akin to gangsta rap than Glen Miller. ""Forties"" it definitely is NOT.Though I initially was interested in the story, it devolved quickly into a nonsensical race to the bottom in trying to outdo itself for sheer in-your-face, amoral brutality. Is this Tarrantino thinks passes for entertainment? God, I can't imagine what a twisted, jaded, socio-pathological mind can produce such disgusting, visually repellent images.And then for a finale, QT decides to completely rewrite history, and two members of a ragtag troop of misfits - with the help of a theatre owner and her projectionist - defeat the entire German high command. No armies required, TYVM. What a joke.In the end I found myself somewhat ashamed for having sat and watched this. It says far more about who we are today in 2010 America, than it ever would about WWII. And what it says is something less than complimentary."
tt1130884,"i was one of the lucky ones to sit and watch the pre release of the shutter island in the opening with the director himself.as said ""It's 1954, and up-and-coming U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Boston's Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital. He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he wonders whether he hasn't been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals ""escape"" in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity""enjoy"
tt0120815,"Considered by many to be a fantastic film, I feel I must have missed something. This film is certainly a good film by any standards. (The camera work is well done, backdrops are excellent and the opening scene on the beaches of Normandy is one of the most memorable in cinema history) But the film does suffer from a couple of failings.Firstly, it is strongly and unapologetically patriotic. The film beings and ends with the American flag, and the in fact, the Americans appear to be the only people in the film. The only appearances from other nationalities are the Germans, and the only character seen is a back-stabbing monster. In contrast, the American soldiers are all rough diamonds, and each death scene for an American character is a tear-jerking moment of sadness.Secondly, the plot. After the initial scene, the plot becomes somewhat silly, going increasingly downhill until the surviving half dozen characters end the movie fighting a battalion of soldiers and a squad of tanks. I really don't understand how anyone can watch the end of this film with any seriousness.In conclusion, I'd say that the only way this movie deserves the high regard it seems to have is if after watching the opening half hour, the movie was switched off. None the less, I would recommend viewing this film, as its qualities do outshine the flaws."
tt0120737,"This review contains SPOILERSAll qualities of the book were sacrificed for the sake of an action film full of cheap plot devices, gratuitous and often illogical story changes, and poor characterization. The scenery was actually great, if the camera would ever stop whirling around long enough to allow it to be enjoyed. I appreciate a sweeping camera move judiciously used to set off a dramatic vista, but that device was done to death. The action scenes are such a blitz of brief incoherent cuts that they were hard to watch. The lighting is frequently peculiar, for example everyone in Rivendell looked waxy and sallow. Then there is the music. I am afraid the composer has watched Conan the Barbarian a few two many times. Operatic choir music = bad guys, every time you see them. Yuk! Those are just the minor flaws in this piece of trash.The endless action cliches and cheap devices left me groaning at such a ham-handed treatment of Tolkien. From the sacrifice of Sam, Merry, and Pippin's characters for the sake of comedy, to the crumbling staircase in Moria, to the silly wizard battle between Gandalf and Saruman (complete with the dive off the tower, only to be caught by the eagle ploy). All of this was invented by Peter Jackson, as if the book does not provide enough exciting events to draw upon. It is a long book, and clearly cuts had to be made for a manageable movie. But to expend precious minutes on protracted combats and repetitious detail of Isengard, while leaving out important story and character development is truly sad. In fact, Jackson goes so far as to drag material belonging to The Two Towers (the shortest of the three books) into this movie (which is the longest of the three books).Many of these changes do nothing for the story, sometimes even weaken it. In the books Saruman is in it for himself, believing himself to be the one person who could stand up to Sauron, if only he had the ring. His view of things has been warped by Sauron's subtle control of what he sees through the Palantir. This is much more interesting than Saruman as the avowed lackey of Sauron. The former case makes sense of the treatment Saruman gets at the end of The Two Towers, while the later does not!The combat and action should have been brief, intense, and significant. In the book none of the combat with Boromir defending Merry and Pippin is seen, just the tragic result. The battle in Balin's tomb takes up 1 page out of 400. It is short, fierce, and to the point. The incident of Frodo turning out to be okay after being speared is actually rather funny in the book. In the movie this is blown so far out of proportion I thought I would gag. It is turned into the worst of manipulative `character is killed, oh no they are okay' scenes. And for those long minutes (and many others like them) they sacrificed the Barrow Downs? Frodo's `Cow Jumped Over the Moon' table dance? The hobbits actually getting to know and trust Strider on the way to Rivendell?The worst part is the butchery of the characters. Legolas loses his light-hearted singing nature. Gimli is a caricature from a bad D&D game, replete with Irish brogue. Absent was their caustic interaction and the development of their friendship, one of the hallmarks of the books. Hobbits go from the stealthy nimble people of the books to bumbling comic relief. In the book Sam is clever, loves all things elven, knows old ballads. In the movie he is just dumb and loyal. In the movie Merry and Pippin are turned into witless juvenile troublemakers sucked into the quest willy nilly, instead of dedicated friends conspiring with Sam to go on the quest to support Frodo. And Frodo's own strongest moment, when he defies the Nazgul at the river, is taken away, leaving him just a helpless victim dragged along. And finally, back to that ending battle: where is Aragorn's poignant agony watching the Fellowship fall apart under his leadership? And his tortured choice over which way to go? He doesn't have to make it, because the movie adds a scene between Frodo and him settling the matter.Then there are `the bad guys'. We can start with Sauron in the beginning. He looks like some sort of battle droid transformer monster. What is that?! He is a wizard, and in the history of Middle Earth is most famous for his guile and lies, not being a walking tank. The orcs: of course they are supposed to be scary and nasty. But they are in fact a people. It is clear throughout the books that they are more than beasts. Much of the beginning of The Two Towers hinges on their own politics and personalities, as do the events in Cirith Ungol in The Return of the King. But what we see in the movie are almost-zombies who hiss and growl and grunt a word or two. The biggest problem with all of the evil portrayed in the film is the complete lack of subtlety or mystery. It's all shown in full special effects glory, rather than hinted at as in the books. Have I been frightened at movies? Plenty of times. Was I ever frightened during this one? Never.In fact, that is the big flaw in all of this. Peter Jackson has no sense of subtlety. Everything is explicit and obvious and the viewer is clubbed over the head with it. The movie is informed less by the books than by the stereotype-ridden gaming genre that came out of it. If the movie I saw was in turn novelized, the result would be just one more derivative hack and slash novel that would be forgotten a couple of years after publication."
tt0068646,Before i fell asleep i was extremely bored. couldn't tell you what the plot is whatsoever.
tt0137523,"If you read the opinions about the film from different sites from different people, you can find out that basically you will either adore ""Fight Club"", or in the opposite direction you will dislike it to the same extent. I am one of the first. Moreover, this is probably my favorite movie.I liked everything here - from the actors' acting to the plot itself or the production of shots. The film is at least memorable and obviously will not leave anyone indifferent. The plot and motivation of the characters have long been known to everyone, if not, then it's for the best, a brief description and understanding will be enough for you.It's up to you to decide whether to watch or not. For me, according to the assessment and the above-written - ""... favorite movie ...

tt7286456,"In the non-canonical origin story Joker, Joaquin Phoenix plays a deeply disturbed man named Arthur Fleck as he experiences through a series of traumas that turn him into the notorious supervillain.Phoenix is terrific as the agonized loser with a compulsive-laughter condition. He's weird and creepy and full of angst and anger and self-loathing and everyone-else-loathing.The first half hour is simply a grinding, agonizingly slow moving portrayal of Arthur's life. Then there's a moment of stunning, electrifying violence. And then everything gets tedious again.Joker is not a supervillain movie, it's an artsy character study, and if you like those then this might appeal to you. But there's a superficiality to it all. Arthur is deeply disturbed and living in a city where society's have-nots are increasingly disenfranchised, but the script and director don't really seem to have anything to say about mental illness or inequality and injustice.In the run-up to the film, director Todd Phillips criticized ""woke"" culture and the far left, and perhaps that's part of the problem. Woke culture says we need to think about things deeply, and Phillips really, really seem loathe to delve into what it means to be mentally unstable and poor in the greater societal sense. He's only concerned with how it effects Arthur. Arthur is also only concerned with how it effects Arthur, and the result is a film that seems to accept that Arthur is a victim of an unjust society while never really considering why the society is unjust or how much of Arthur's problems might be the result of his own narcissistic self pity.But the main problem with the movie is it's slow-moving and dull far more often than not. I wouldn't recommend it."
tt0372784,"I enjoyed the film BATMAN from Tim Burton, though I'll be the first to admit that it was very, very dark and disturbing. I'd also agree that the Batman role in this and subsequent films was a bit one-dimensional--with a much greater emphasis on the villains and amazing cartoon-like scenes. However, despite enjoying the first film, the subsequent films were a disappointment to me as they just seemed overloaded with special effects and were a bit light on character development.In light of this, I really appreciated how the Batman character was hashed out and given much greater depth in BATMAN BEGINS--especially because it explains the long evolution of Bruce Wayne to caped crusader. Christian Bale was very good in the leading role and the story was very unusual but enjoyable to a point--though the plot did get awfully convoluted towards the end. In fact, I would say that the least interesting part of the film was the final conflict at the end, as this seemed a lot like previous Batman films--full of special effects but that's about all.Now my quibbles with BATMAN BEGINS are quite minor and I can't fault the movie too much because it doesn't pretend to be Shakespeare or a contender for a Sundance award! It is just old fashioned entertainment. Not especially deep, but entertaining.By the way, when I saw this film I was amazed at the high-priced talent organized for this film--Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman. In particular, Freeman and Caine were terrific in the film."
tt0468569,"There is nothing special about this movie. Period. Nothiing special. It tries on so many levels to be this big mega movie, and in financial terms, it was, but you know what? It's still not good, no matter how many fans it has, no matter how much money it pulls in. Those are just figures and numbers, and they're quite boring in the long run. Let's go over a few reasons why it was not good. First off, the story bites off way more than is necessary. We have Bruce Wayne in this ridiculous attempt to win back a woman he'll never have the chance to be with. The woman he is in love with prances around like a little school girl, and really has no business being in the story to begin with. She is just there to make both Batman and Harvey Dent rival each other. I'm so sure that the writers could have come up with a better plan to pit the two against each other than that. Then, there's the Joker...the most ridiculous part of the story. Ridiculous because of the lengths and the means that the filmmakers took to bring a new kind of villain. It's not entertaining, it's not disturbing, it's just sick. This movie was not fun. It was not entertaining. It was a product for the mindless audiences who were going to buy into it anyway, and especially because of the death of Heath edger. Let's talk a little about that. This film had success that rode the curtail of Ledgers death. The studio deliberately used the poor suffering of a human being to push a film into exhibition. That's really sad, and you know what else? It's all this film will ever be...the last film of Heath Ledger, and America went to see it because he died before it's release. sad. Really sad. I didn't like it, and I bet others will not like me for that very reason. Even more sad still."
tt0167261,"We have witnessed another melancholic Two Towers tragedy. That is the second installment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy `The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'. This ring also fits into the hand of pathetic cinema just as the one of the previous fellowship. The film brings back all of its characters: hobbits Frodo & Sam, Gandalf the Wizard, hobbit defender Aragorn, and all the rest of these ludicrous characters who are more reminiscent of `ringling circus' animals than lords of rings.   My quest, just as it was last year, is for this ring version to get destroyed at Oscar night and not receive any major wins. * Failure"
tt0875595,"Demirkubuz has a specific style. Just like any cinephile can tell a Bergman film from one by Tarkovsky, Bresson from Almodovar, and so on, you can tell a Demirkubuz title from anything directed by anyone else, by his style. That is not to say he's always great, he does have his weaker features. (Such as casting his goddess-looking wife on one of his flicks to make up for the weak plot). The only thing that's always good about him is his excellent setting of pace, for which Nuri Bilge Ceylan needs his private lessons. All that said, this one was a typical Demirkubuz movie by all means. Just like Masumiyet, which is connected to this movie, it deals with fragile lives and shattered dreams. I imagine 99% of the readers would agree that's ace for the style he adopts.Well, let me start with the few bad things about this movie. The language! Turkish people do swear a lot, Turkish people pursuing the lifestyles outlined in this movie swear even more, but use of heavy slang is still excessive in this movie. And believe me, I am an authority on that, because I've been known to let my let profane language slip my tongue myself. Just take it this way, a nun could find anyone slutty. But if a street hooker finds someone slutty, chances are she has a point! Speaking of street hookers; a Turkish woman from any walk of life, including street hookers, would never ever use the phrase ""sikildigimle kaldim"" in any conversation, even when talking to other women. It just doesn't sound natural, and the whole conversation between Ugur's mother and Bekir on his visit was simply out of key. For the excessive swearing, although I didn't like it much, I can see through the frames and picture Demirkubuz going on fire and saying ""right on!"" and hitting his fist on the table ferociously. This shows he really got into the script, and I find such a directing skill amazing, considering the horrid actor he is. Now, that really sums it up for all the downs of this movie.As for the ups, the story is interesting, the scenes are well-shot, the acting is splendid, and the dose of bleakness is just right. At times it feels like an Angelopoulos or even Kaurism√§ki work, which by itself means it's relatively slow but ultimately captivating. The lack of an emphasized ending is supposed to ruin everything, but everything is set so well that it actually feels more rewarding. The long fight consequence scene was also really successful. Until the very last second, you can't tell who killed whom, but the camera is so good that you don't end up feeling like you're watching a soap opera. Something that I just thought of to finalize: Even the name selection is exploding of intelligence! The movie's name is ""destiny"", and the movie's message is ""nothing is destiny, you make your own destiny"". I just love that! Overall Kader is a fantabulous (fantastic+fabulous) feature, and gets 9,5/10 from me. Seeing such a robust effort in the Turkish cinema in the era where people like Altioklar with their plot less Hollywood style trash are considered directors, is very promising.If you are interested in Turkish cinema, and you are one of those who think a movie must be either fun or rewarding, but prefer one that is both, stay away from boring Tarkovksy wannabes and √ºber-miserable Tarantino wannabes, and follow Demirkubuz. Needless to say, Kader is a particularly good start at that."
tt0109830,"While this film has good points which others have already mentioned, I wanted to point out some points that really irritated me.The #1 thing is that this film would shed tears for the shooting of George Wallace, an opportunistic politician who curried racist favour for his own cheap political gain, yet have NOT ONE mention of Martin Luther King in any way, shape or form.  This was even though he was working in Alabama at the same time when Forrest was growing up and it would be certainly more believable for Forrest to meet King than 90% percent of the celebrities he meets in his life.  I'm not asking him to meet Malcolm X, considering he was working in New York at the time.  Yet, King is ignored as if he didn't exist.Second, the cross country marathon screams of being tacked on.  I fail to see any humour in it and my eyes rolled how the media completely ignores in their reports that this ""mystery marathonner"" is an All American football player, a Congressional Medal of Honour recipient, a ping pong company spokesman and a millionaire owner of a fishing fleet.  You would figure this would make a lot of hay for any reporter writing this up about a man who can do all this and have a IQ of less than 75."
tt0114369,"Seven is a crime, thriller following a rookie and a hardened, retiring detective as they try and solve the case of the mysterious murders, one per day for Seven days, finding that the victims also follow a pattern, they all represent one aspect of the seven deadly sins. The duo must find this killer before he finishes his grand masterpiece.I love this movie, the grimy and dark atmosphere, almost rustic in nature. Beauty in imperfection. David Fincher is a masterful director, choosing to rely on the weight of the scene, allowing it to hold, over fast cuts and fancy camera movements. The movie hooks you in most with it's disturbing nature, everything is so graphic and or disturbing in context. Right there, seeing what the detectives sees, trying to solve this puzzle with them.But outside of that, the story is simple yet deals with complex ideas, while also keeping it in a 2 hour runtime, which is impressive, knowing how long it needs to be and not over staying it's welcome.The only real issue i had with the movie is that i didn't feel that much of a connection as much as i should have to the story, until John Doe finally comes into the picture. From there, the movie is tense and had me hooked the entire time, the building music and the overall feeling that the characters are not in control. This is Fincher's true start into cinema. Though i prefer fight club and zodiac, this is by far his best original project."
tt0120815,"The more I think about this film and read differing reviews about it the more I feel it wasn't meant for me. I'm a Finn, not American. I don't know if Spielberg meant this film as a last hoorah for the G.I.:s, but to me that is what he made. All right the film does have something to tell for everyone: in the insane theatre of war one should try to do the right thing, have courage to do it, that your actions have consequences, war as a whole creates nothing but bad feelings and probably something else too but nothing that has not been told earlier.And I suppose that isn't so bad, I mean there have certainly been worse films. But what does bother me is that Spielberg set out to do a film about what war is really like and to me, he failed. Yes I have seen the opening scene and to me it was more about exploitation and action film then about anything else and not even very memorable action. Even if one would skip all the omissions and strange things about the film (in the landing scene no naval artillery support, no air force support and the illogical German tactics in the final battlescenes) to me the main plot is a strange curiosity that only serves to illustrate that the average soldier wasn't that interesting or important. Apparently with some links to reality the main plot remains distant and odd to me.With Oscar, block-buster, critically acclaimed material as ww2 with all the gore how could Spielberg go wrong? First of all the acting. Well I could not stop wishing there would have been some lesser known actors used, maybe even amateurs. A lot has been made out of the cinematography and yes, it is good. Although to me it is not so effective when there is apparently too much money to make a film and then the camera work tries to make it look more realistic. As ww2 films go this film is a far cry from ""Come and See"". Yes I do admit that flag waving is a common problem among ww2 movies, I just wished that Spielberg could have avoided it."
tt0120815,"The beach scenes are absolutely fantastic, and I'm not sure if I did breathe at all during those sequences. The sound and the effects are amazing, the use of small hand cams gave the whole thing a documentary feeling of the hell that met the men who landed on the beach. Sadly after that it is not too good, and the film quickly becomes a standard Hollywood WW2 film, with heroic Americans and stupid German soldiers. A better story and less sentimentality (everyone understands that young men being blow to pieces is a tragedy and this need not be pointed out by the director. The price for freedom is high)would have given this film a 10/10. I think the men who laid down their lives on the beaches in the fight to free Europe deserves more than this."
tt0139414,"It's a sad state of affairs to see what happens when good actors go bad. Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt. These are good actors. What happened? All I can think of is lots of money. I mean, does anybody expect anything superb in a movie about a killer giant alligator? I didn't expect Oscar winner, but even Deep Blue Sea was slightly entertaining. This was just a waste of time. Not funny. Not scary. Not exciting. Boring."
tt0848228,"The avengers is a classic marvel movie full of action, stunning special effects and the odd bit of funny humour. I think Age of Ultron will be better but this is still a fun and enjoyable film. I love how it appeals to everyone not just comic book fans. I can't find any flaws in this movie , it kinda has everything you need in a good movie:action, comedy, cool quotes and stunning special effects. I also love how marvel did movies before this one so the characters could be developed. The casting choices were also great. Everyone fits perfectly as the character they were chosen to play. Robert Downey Jr is great as Iron Man and Scarlett Johannson is amazing as Black Widow. My favourite is Samuel L Jackson as the tough but amazing Nick Fury. All in all WATCH THIS FILM."
tt0137523,"I don't think I've ever been put off a film by its violent content .. until this one. You come out of it feeling like you've been swimming in a tub full of offal. After two hours or so it really starts to become boring, which is disturbing in itself. After it finished though, and I got the more disgusting images out of my mind somewhat, I thought, it really doesn't make much sense either - did anyone ever hear of data backups, maybe? and just how do you wire up a condemned old house for a heap of electronic gismos to conduct a urban warfare campaign? Cronenberg manages all the creepiness and shocking images (e.g. Videodrome) without stooping to the goriness that this film revels in."
tt1345836,"First of all, when I was in the theater watching (The Dark Knight) I said to myself that there's no way I'm going to miss the next movie in this series. after the epic nature and the overwhelming performance also the art of directing that makes you live inside the movie as we have seen in The Dark Knight, I expected this one to be at least the same level and I was absolutely correct. Christopher Nolan is the best Director out there, the way he makes you become part of the movie and feel the same feeling of every character you see is just magical, and add to that the fantastic music of Hans Zimmer, not to mention the Perfect Selection of the Actors and Actresses in this movie. Before The Dark Knight all of us used to watch super hero movies and consider them the kind of thing that would never happen in real life but things changed after the epic clash between batman and the Joker, The Dark Knight Rises even make it more reasonable it makes you think that if there was a batman he would be exactly like this. and it is being proved in each scene as you go through the movie, how hard it is to live with the cruelty of bane, how it is really hard to find weapons and devices to use that they use everything they got (unlike other action movies that everyone suddenly have a 100 gun when it is time to fight) it is like what would really happen if Bane came to your city and Batman was to defend it. in other words you can call this movie a masterpiece,if you didn't watch it yet then what are you waiting for?"
tt0110912,"Pulp Fiction is the most overrated movie I've ever seen. Reservior Dogs had released and was the talk of the town. Average movie that talks a lot and is set in mainly one place. Pulp Fiction is another movie that talks a lot, and doesn't do much else. It is a 2 in a half hour long movie and calls itself a action gangster movie. There is hardly any violence in this movie, its just talking talking and more talking. No where near comparable then Goodfellas, Scarface, Godfather or Casino. Only a few jokes like Bruce Willas and Ving Rhames in their worst nightmare. This is more of a comedy gangster related movie like Lock Stock and two smoking barrels. That was funny."
tt0137523,"The first time I watched this flick is when I'm in my junior high. My thought are what an amazing film this is. Ten years later in my College I watched this again and I'm in the awestruck, how come such a splendid craftsmanship bring so much joy to my life. After the first watched now 17 years later I watched it with my pregnant wife. And she's had the same reaction like when I'm in Junior high. Times goes by, but this film is sit still the Thorne of awesomeness."
tt1130884,"Shutter Island. The story starts you off with a strong suspense of something really wrong in the so called island. It then develops a very subtle intrigue to the story, which keeps us assuming and guessing repeatedly on what the actual truth is. When the story progresses, just when you've received the pieces of the puzzle to actually delve the story, you then realize that you've been working on the right pieces, but in the wrong puzzle.The acting was very good and well coordinated. You could feel the dramatization of the characters and subtle elements that will keep your mind moving. They also arranged the sound well, with a simple yet chilling heavy bass orchestra to psyche up the moment, and at the same time complete silence to pique in your senses. I was a bit disappointed with some parts of the editing, but these small bricks didn't affect any major enjoyment of the movie.This movie should be watched with great attention to detail, to give yourself a satisfying outcome once all the mysteries unwind itself, leaving you with a repeating portrait of the story in your mind."
tt0167261,"Extremely boring and long movie with poor storyline. The action and special effects were great, but those are tiny upsides in comparision."
tt1345836,"Part 1 and 2 where good but part 3 is something really boring. After the first part of this movie when I saw it in the cinema I still hoped it would get better and maybe even awesome. This didn't happen. The first part of the movie made a couple of my friends, sitting next to me, fall asleep. This almost happened to me too and that would have been the second time ever if it would have happened. Instead I laughed because two of my friends had indeed fallen asleep. batman does almost nothing in the first hour because he is crippled or something. How exciting, a batman who can't do anything. And I'm not writing batman with a capitol b because this batman isn't worth pressing the shift key. Catwoman is pretty cool. The problem here however is that she isn't really Catwoman. She's is just a girl with cool moves and a tight outfit. No cats anywhere. The bad guy is nice but the movie is so slow that it doesn't matter. In the second part of the movie we see batman recovering from a hernia just like that. All of sudden he is the man again. However, this doesn't give you any real cool Batman action. Noooo just the same lame batman action we had to see (or sleep through) all movie long. Most of the things batman does, he does from some bat bike or bat plane which is boring. I almost forgot, the acting by most actors isn't really good. Most of it is boring, again. Except for the butler played by Michael Caine. He's a good actor in most of his movies but manages to make you laugh your ass off when he starts a sentimental lecture to Bruce Wayne. It's so funny when he starts crying and makes the movie even more stupid. It's not that I can't take sentimental moments, no. Believe me, it just looked ridiculous. And of course batman needs someone to follow in his footsteps because well, he kills himself trying to save the city. We can all see who's going to be the new Robin halfway through but I remembered Batman and Robin working together from old series, cartoons etc. These two hardly know each other. I don't know if they even meet in this movie. I can't remember because I'd rather remember a movie that's worth watching like the first two of this series. Or even better, the movies with Micheal Keaton as Batman. That Batman kicked ass!!"
tt0848228,"OK went into the cinema in April, ready to give this film a fair chance. Of course i knew what to expect and as usual, i wasn't disappointed. Not that that's good for the film. After watching it i then began to hear almost everybody say it was the best film in the world. Well that a Huge claim. Well TBH it doesn't have any of the qualities of ""Best film ever made"" in it. Story was at best flawed, some characters i would go as far to say as boring and the Special FX were just a cover up, blinding viewers from the truth, its not a great film. And then there's the villain. Weak.But it's not all bad, i thought it was funny and if your a fan of everything exploding then it is good for a quick thrill. Thought Nick Fury, Iron Man and Bruce Banner were good characters.I think the Kindest thing i can say about this movie is that it is Average. But like Avatar it is Hugely overrated, I'm afraid its another example of FX covering a mediocre story. Fun to watch but not the best film ever made. (By some way)"
tt0111161,"Shawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made, and definitely the best film of 1994. Yes, it is better than Lion King, and I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and moving too. I will confess that I didn't understand it when I first saw it as a lot happens in the film, and I have now seen it three times. I seriously hope, that those who ignored the film when it was first released now recognise it as a great film, as it really is. The dialogue was extremely well-written, with lines that really stick in your mind. The cinematography and music are both gorgeous, and the prison itself is like a character that dominates the film. In the script, there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am not a huge king fan, and usually don't like coarse language in books. But in his books like It, which is very good, I have accepted the language represents brutality and rebellion, shown perfectly in the film with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and the superiors(like the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at the new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.)The acting was exceptional. I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins, but he did a great job in a very demanding role. The best performance however, comes from Morgan Freeman as Red, who was seriously robbed of that Oscar, that he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump. Freeman reminds me very strongly, or his style of acting does, remind me of that of Sean Connery, suave yet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal range, it's about depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In short, Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. The scene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the speakers was a beautiful profound moment, and I actually cried in Brook's death scene. Very rarely do King adaptations translate-to screen well, because of the large scale of the author's books, with the exception of this and the Shining. Some like It and Dreamcatcher are genuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from being classed as outstanding. And some, like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film, that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long. 10/10 of course. Bethany Cox."
tt0114369,"This movie is almost unwatchable because of the pornographic use of violence. There are filmmakers who use violence sparingly when necessary and then there are the ones who wallow in it like porn. This is an example of the gratuitous use of violence. The studios know that Americans and lots of foreign markets like southeast Asia LOVE violence for its own sake and so they dish it up because it sells. It sells better than sex. Religious zealots will let their kids watch violence while insisting that they avoid sex. So these kinds of movies get elevated to Academy stature. It's symptomatic of the American psyche. We would rather let our kids kill someone than have too much sex. Okay, that's overstated but you get the point. Quentin Tarantino is one of the most famous violence porn producers. David Finscher is talented but I can just imagine him and Quentin masturbating to graphic violence. They need it to get off."
tt0848228,"The Avengers,the story of a group of super-powered people (well some of them anyway) who are recruited by a secret agency to stop a threat that apparently one hero alone can't fight. Such lies.Captain America,(Chris Evans)- the so called leader of the avengers. A nice person to the point of garystudom. He is one of the most boring characters in the movie. I watched the avengers for the first time a few months ago on Netflix, and Cap's origin movie was on there as well, and I tried to watch it but only got to the 30 minute mark and shut it off. I was bored to proverbial tears. I don't get the appeal. For me he has no presence and is as forgettable and boring as Hawkeye and Black Widow.Ironman,(RDJ)- the real leader in my opinion. He seems to be the focus for most of the important plot points, and he is the one who untimely saves New-York. He just has a presence that the rest of them lacked. Where the heroes were concerned the movie was more like Ironman featuring the Avengers and I actually didn't have problem with that.Out of them all I loved his costume the most, and seeing him here has made me want to go out and see his origin movie and sequels.Thor (Chris Hemsworth)- Thor is decent by himself, but the interest level really comes in when he's playing against Tom Hiddleston's Loki. Hemsworth and Hiddleston play well off each other. They have great chemistry and their love/hate brother dynamic is always fascinating to watch. This is a shame that this was barely touched on in Thor's own movie. Since to me the family dynamic is the meat of their stories. I loved watching their scenes in this movie (the little that we got to see of it) where we get to witness them bounce their dialogue and emotions off each other.Thor as a character shines better when he is on his own planet. Or pretty much any planet not named Earth. It's like when he's on ours it nearly sucks out everything interesting about him.Hawkeye( Jeremy Renner) and Black-Widow(Scarlett Johansson )- Two completely human characters fighting alongside super- powered people. Yea, really don't get that. They were wallpaper for me just like Captain America. When they were on screen it's like they were barely registering. I should not have a continuous question mark in my brain when it comes to a character.Bruce Banner/The Hulk(MarkRuffalo)- I have never seen the hulk movies (apparently there are a fair few) or the TV show. My first foray into this character was in this movie. He is nervous and twitchy, but generally a nice person and I think Ruffalo pulled that off nicely.Then he turns into the Hulk¬Ö. I didn't like the Hulk. He's too godlike for one thing. Same problem I have with Thor and his kind. It takes the emotional stakes out of the character if it's pretty impossible for them to die. He also acts like an animal. Also not a fan of obvious CGI characters (huge green ones at that) being mains and running around with actual real people. It's very jarring in a bad way. I also don't think a full-blown movie works for him. His character works better in an ensemble or even better not part of the cast at all. As for the Bruce part of him well we already have a genius level scientist. Don't really need two. Overall I didn't enjoy the hulk and wanted him off my screen.Loki (Tom Hiddleston) - the main villain who pretty much took over the movie by his first scene on down. Like in his co-origin movie 'Thor' he is a true scene stealer. I loved watching him. Hiddleston is a treasure to watch act this character out. If the academy wasn't such stuck- ups about fantasy/sci-fi movies I truly think he deserved an Oscar for his portrayal in this and the first 'Thor' movie. His acting for Loki is just brilliant.However, no amount of scene stealing acting is going to erase that Whedon pretty much destroyed his overall character. He went from a sympathetic villain in 'Thor' to a complete monster punch line in this one. The tone of this movie wasn't serious enough in the first place with Whedon thinking he had to make everyone be a walking comedian, but I will never understand the logic of making your villain be the silliest thing in the movie.Sadly that is exactly what Whedon did. Loki was a pathetic villain.He took a great character and made him into a joke. The last straw though was not the constant beat downs and jokes at his expense, but an encounter with one of the avengers toward the end of the movie. Loki as a villain had officially went into ludicrous territory at that point. However, what saved him as a character for me was no matter how silly his dialogue sounded at points, or how many times he kissed pavement, or just how overall ridiculous he was as a villain, Hiddleston acted his butt off as Loki. I couldn't take my eyes off the character. All I wish is that Loki from now on stays in the 'Thor' movies and that Joss Whedon doesn't get to touch the character ever again.In summary the movie's tone was to comedic. It was like whedon was writing for the next bada bing instead of great emotional character moments. The dialogue was more cheesy and clich√© then not.The CGI looked dated.There was no real emotional punch. I just didn't care if they lived or died. Although It wasn't like they were in any real danger of that happening in the first place since the movie overall lacked believable tension,and the villain was well acted but really pathetic as one."
tt0114369,"***Spoilers included****Great.  Just what the world needs.  Another dark, disturbing, gratuitously violent movie that has delusions of achieving the dizzy heights of a modern classic.  Sure- I recognise that the movie has good points.  The performances are pretty good, the camera techniques and photography employed effectively enhance the subject matter and hey- there is always Gwyneth losing her head - something that should have happened a long time ago (if you think I'm probably not a Gwyneth fan..well- you'd be right).  But my objection lies in the completely depraved scenes that accompany each of the seven (sorry about that - I meant, of course, Se7en) sins.  This is torturous violence at it's most debased.  And if the movie is about how desensitised we all are to the problems of the world we live in, then why did this movie make me leave the cinema feeling violated?Don't get me wrong.  I'm wouldn't consider myself prudish or oversensitive when it comes to violence on the screen- after all, I am a classic Gen X, who grew up watching violence and sex of some form or another manifest before me.   I can usually watch serial killer movies without too many problems (apart from the entirely involuntary hands over the eyes during the critical moments).  But this was different. This was disturbing.  Maybe I just can't stand the suffering and torture of the human condition that was evident in this movie.  Or maybe it was because the good guys definitely don't win out in the end and I've been so Hollywoodised (yeah- I know it's not a word, but it was the best I could come up with) that I can't handle this fact.Seriously, don't bother with this movie."
tt0108052,"After watching the well-crafted and riveting ""Judgment at Nuremberg,"" I was prepared for a worthy follow-up - companion piece - in ""Schindler's List."" This over-rated film was a dismal disappointment to me. Anyone with a heart and soul could have felt the suffering and tribulations - of the Jewish population - without the director resorting to heavy-handed dramatic subterfuge, telegraphed to elicit sympathy for their plight. Furthermore, the movie could have been cut by at least an hour and benefited from that alone. Conversely, Liam Neeson's final scene was so over-the-top and downright hammy that it was totally unbelievable to me. All in all I deeply resent this important subject matter treated in such a forced-fed or programmed manner that precluded the audience from forming their own conclusions and allowing us to arouse genuinely deep-felt compassion for the victims of these atrocities... If simplicity is elegance this lengthy, haphazard hodgepodge lacked the class it should have displayed and as a result left me cold. I unreservedly recommend those who actually liked this picture to view ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" to distinguish the difference between mawkish, self-indulgent directing and true art."
tt0167261,"This somehow did not work for me. If this was supposed to be serious, it was verging on the ridiculous. I could excuse the first one for a little low-brow humour considering it didn't get right into the journey at first, but it was too overdone to at least lighten the mood in a serious context. It also had massive pacing issues, as it either brought everything to a standstill or hurried everything on, and it's suddenly strange how they stray off and bring to your attention scenes of no point whatsoever.On the positive side, the acting wasn't affected too much. The scenes with either Legolas, Aragorn or Frodo were beautifully done, so I have come to terms with the fact that the acting can still be good even when the pacing isn't. Despite that, they should have taken a few of the characters out, because they were kind of pointless. I liked Gollum (or Sm√©agol), but I think he was just there for the crazy factor.Overall, it was good, but was not as good as the first one. This could definitely have been better. Maybe they should just have done two films if there was going to be such a big gap in the middle."
tt0480025,"Amazing film with a funny, sad and emotional storyline followed up by the series.. great film and great show. The actors they picked are amazing and fit the storyline perfect."
tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption is in my opinion the most Overrated film in history. With the highest IMDb rating ever it confuses me why people like it so much. It's a fine movie but not the Greatest Ever. Morgan freedman's performance is Alright wildly Overrated It's hard to believe this is the best. I've watched this movie 3 times each time I was disappointed with literally Everything. With such an iconic legacy for a movie I don't understand what people love about this Film it's just not Great. The film should be fantastic with a Amazing Cast all around I don't understand how this film truly flops so badly.
tt0114369,"I probably haven't watched this film since it came out on VHS (Yep, that long ago). I thought that I'd better watch it again before I added it to my films list as I really couldn't remember all that much about it. And that is probably because apart from the very end it's quite a forgettable film.Although, I believe, the focus is supposed to be on Brad Pitt's character, it is definitely Morgan Freeman that owns this film. He gives a great performance as the embittered older detective, as he always does, but he just doesn't have the support of a good story or script.For me, it would have been better if Brad had been part of 21 Jump Street instead as his character is very similar to that. He's not mature enough to be a big bad detective. Which I realise is supposed to a part of the story, but that's not how it comes across.As for Gwyneth? This is possibly the worst performance I have even seen from her! Her character is just weird and apart from the end, quite superfluous to the story.As for Kevin, is this what he got up to before he was in 'The Usual Suspects'(1995)? He plays freaky, odd people too well. Maybe that's why his private life allegedly went wrong?You do have to wonder about the weirdos that write these things? I mean I have some very sick thoughts, but these murders are just bizarre. I think they tried too hard and didn't deliver.It doesn't seem to flow very well and it's a bit drawn out. The whole thing seems a bit disconnected.187.55/1000."
tt0167260,"I was actually really disappointed with this movie. I suppose it's because I read the book first and you usually get disappointed with the film based on a book if you've read the book first. Anyway I think it's so obvious that the most important reason to make this film was so make a lot of money. The film makers have put too much energy and time to all these boring and endless action scenes that only anyway are destroying the mystic feeling of the movie. All the other parts of the movie are actually pretty good and I wonder why they didn't give these parts more space in the movie. I don't see why they had to change that much, especially in the ending, if it wasn't just to get more time to the fighting scenes, and then be able to make more money. And that's not good movie making is it?"
tt0108052,"It is only twice that I have watched this movie and it definitely is one of the classics of Hollywood. Probably the finest work (and undoubtedly one of the finest) of Steven Spielberg till date. In the backdrop of Nazi-occupied Poland, Schindler's List comprises of Jews who are to be saved by an otherwise greedy and flamboyant businessman but a transformed humanitarian, Oskar Schindler.Story (10/10): The story is based on Thomas Keneally's 1982 novel ""Schindler's Ark"". It is a story of a German businessman who went all out to save the Jews who were being massacred by the Nazi army post-invasion of Poland. While, initially, he employed the Jews to make quick money by exploiting them. However, the views of people being needlessly killed by the Nazi army evokes the human inside him and that's when he decides to do whatever possible to save as many lives as possible. And while doing that, he not only has to manage the secrecy of the purpose but also justify the purpose of every single Jew in his company to the bloodthirsty Nazi army. The screenplay is brilliant and it couldn't have been better adapted from the novel.Acting (9/10): Liam Neeson, playing the title role, was effortless in the projection of a greedy, money-minded and a womanizer businessman in the beginning of the movie and an emotional, humanitarian later on. One of the toughest scenes was when he is watching the Jewish massacre from the top of a hill - and his expressions in that scene told a thousand words, something which is very tough. It was quite a challenging role and Liam executes it like a boss. Besides Liam, another actor that stood out in the movie was Ralph Fiennes. His role and quality of acting reminded me of the role of Christopher Waltz in Inglorious Bastards. Playing a role of a cruel Nazi commandant of the Krak√≥w-P≈Çasz√≥w concentration camp in P≈Çasz√≥w (German-occupied Poland), he was brilliant in his cold looks and depiction of hatred towards the Jews. Ben Kingsley was commendable in his role of Jewish accountant of Oskar Schindler. His depiction of a hesitating, unsure and under-confident person (yet rising to the occasion whenever the situation demands), largely due to the circumstances around him, was brilliant.Direction (9/10): I loved the idea of Steven Spielberg shooting this movie in B/W which provided it a vintage feel as well as a slightly dull projection which was necessary considering the subject of the movie. SS has been great with the actors and he brings the best out of it. One negative for me was the length of the movie which was too long, especially when you have such a heavy topic. Conceptualization of some of the scenes are so brilliant they stay on your mind long after you have watched the movie - something I felt when I watched ""12 Angry Men"".Overall (9/10): Definitely, one of the classics in Hollywood, and a must-watch movie, if you love a little heavy but a top quality cinema."
tt0313792,"Directed by Woody Allen. Starring Jason Biggs, Christina Ricci, Woody Allen, Danny DeVito, Stockard Channing, KaDee Strikland, Erica Leerhsen, David Conrad, Jimmy Fallon, Adrian Grenier. (R)In roles that would have been played by Woody and Diane Keaton a few decades ago, Biggs is a neurotic aspiring writer who loves Ricci's pretty but problematic would-be actress. Why he puts up with her is a complete mystery; why Woody thought the viewer would care enough about them to puzzle it out is an even bigger stumper. Biggs (in a flat performance) breaks the fourth wall and has conversations with a fellow struggling artist played by Allen that feel like fantasy sequences where he's addressing his future self. Ricci has a few funny lines, but her character is so unappealing that it's kind of like watching a sex offender do stand-up. The actors know the dance steps, but they can't find the tempo; only DeVito as Biggs' business manager really pulls it off. A real disappointment, though it has a few outspoken fans (Quentin Tarantino claims it's one of his favorite movies!).39/100"
tt0372784,"Christopher Nolan undertook the difficult task of bringing back Gotham's savior and managed to pull it off in style. Nolan's tribute to the 'Caped Crusader' is a clean break from the twentieth century franchise that included Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney donning the mask of the great DC comic detective. The chiseled Christian Bale takes on the mantle of the 'Dark Knight' as Nolan delivers a gritty, edgy and, dare I say it, more realistic Batman than his predecessors, who inadvertently ended up making a parody of the superhero and his exploits.Bale delivers a troubled and dark Bruce Wayne who in is complexity is more credible then the Bruces of the past. As Batman, he fits the mold although his delivery could use some work.Cillian Murphy is far too pretty to play an arch villain like 'The Scare Crow' who, surprisingly, didn't pose much of a threat and would be laughed at if considered a true nemesis. On the other side of the tracks is the world's favourite girl next door, Ms. Holmes, who still looks like she belongs at the creek. Though their efforts are both apparent and commendable, they still come across as children caught up in a game for grownups.Michael Caine brings emotion, humor and charm to the character of Alfred the Butler as is Gary Oldman believable as the helpless but good, Sergeant Gordon. The original Hitchhiker is back too, with Rutger Hauer's convincing portrayal of the ever so sinister Earle who runs Wayne Enterprises until Bruce comes of age.Liam Neeson's performance is the big surprise in this movie of all stars, which also includes Oscar winner Morgan Freeman and Oscar nominee Ken Watanabe from 'The Last Samurai.' The audience can always expect a great performance from Neeson but in this flick he really hits the mark especially with the physical demands of his character. Not to be out done by the other heavy weights, Tom Wilkinson, also an Oscar nominee for 'In the Bedroom, is up to par in his performance as the immoral underworld boss, Carmine Falcone.The action scenes are shadowed by darkness, literally. The audience doesn't get the opportunity to fully appreciate the fights mainly because they take place under limited lighting. On a brighter note, it's enjoyable to see how Bruce Wayne actually transforms into 'The Batman' albeit is at an accelerated pace.With the combination of a worthy Batman, a great cast, a plot that's not totally predictable and a more REAL and gritty feel, 'Batman Begins' is an enjoyable feature that leaves you waiting anxiously for the next installment."
tt0167260,"I have just staggered out of the cinema after three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by."
tt0361748,"The answer: Having to READ about 2 hours of it! Yes, the man is talented. And yes, there are parts of this overly-lengthy film that are terrific, but I've just come to the point where the thrill is gone. Gone is my appetite for Tarantino's style with excessive homages to an era of films I never saw, and neither did many of his hard-core fans. Gone (if it ever was truly there) is my desire for endless conversations that seldom lead anywhere or advance what little plot his films often have. It's all pretty much gone. Tarantino has been doing this to us for almost twenty years now, and its time that either himself or myself moves on.Inglourious Basterds is marketed to the masses as somewhat of a revenge film about Jewish commandos slaughtering Nazi troops behind enemy lines with Brad Pitt as their leader. Some of this lengthy film will in fact actually deal with that story line. But so much more of it is window dressing with long, subtitled conversations in either French or German. Many of our characters are not believable... even in a Tarantino universe. Nothing we see is plausible. And very little of it is tense. Many have pointed to Christoph Waltz's portrayal of a kind of SS detective as being the lone good aspect of this film. That's pretty much the case. This guy grabs the film and runs away with it. Pitt is tolerable for once, but his character doesn't have to do much in terms of acting range. Thank Goodness. Diane Kruger has some nice moments, and its good to see her in something other than National Treasure movies. I guess... watch if you must, but this is not the director's best work. His breed of film peaked with the Kill Bill movies, and it isn't clear if he is capable of doing anything that isn't just a patchwork of what others have done. Inglourious Basterds is a long, talky waste of 153 minutes. Its few good scenes aren't enough to justify the rest. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound."
tt1345836,"The high rating of this movie here is unbelievable. Did they WATCH the movie? Especially that it is given status as a ""Top 100"" in ANY forum - absurd. This movie, though filled with all the FX of an high budget movie, was a stinker. Everything had the feel of a contractor, over budget, wrapping up a job before the holidays - contrived story - lacking even abstract, ""comic book"" common sense. Packaged, 'out of hat' storyline. I did like The Dark Knight - though Heath Ledgers role Joker/Devil archetype, was what gave its greatest depth. Though it's not new for a high budget movie to be a dud - the biggest disappointment is how many people (here) laud it so highly. Kind of like politics I guess - people will vote party line regardless of the quality of the candidate. I'm glad I didn't spend any money to see this. What a waste."
tt0108052,"Spielberg's so intent on telling the whole history of the Jews of Poland after Germany's invasion that the story gets lost, and I find myself only watching with curiosity rather than empathy.The characters of Schindler and Goethe I enjoyed they're portrayal and think the actors did a good job but on a whole I felt like the film was trying to tell me something rather than make me feel something.I don't mean any offense to Spielberg but I've seen European holocaust films that are less than half the length of this film and they are ten times more powerful than this one. This film is over hyped. If you really believe this is the best holocaust film there is, then you haven't seen enough of them."
tt0137523,"Similar in idea to 'American Beauty' but certainly not in style or content this bleak look at underground culture and the spiritual redemption it brings is easily one of the most intelligent films I've ever seen. Directed by the same man who brought us the superb 'The Game' this is another film which you'll have to see more than once to truly understand.  Focusing on sad white-collar, middle-class Norton whose only real dream in life is to own all the contents of an IKEA catalogue it follows him through a chance meeting with charismatic stranger Pitt and the unfortunate events which conspire to draw them together. After a nights hard drinking they start a friendly-ish scrap which is viewed by a couple of others and from that small acorn a mighty oak called Fight Club grows. This is the point around which the whole film revolves with Norton and Pitt forming an underground club which draws more and more disillusioned young men to join it. Based on firm 'Queensbury Rules' it is a cathartic if bloody way to spend your night. Eventually as it becomes a huge operation Pitt, the de facto leader, moves it up a gear and creates his own cult from this secret society. This is where the film becomes brilliant and the twist near the end is magnificent, better even than the much talked about 'The Sixth Sense'. It just has so much to say about things: the emasculation of an entire generation of young men (""No great war to fight, no great depression""), the growing isolation we all feel from one another and the need to find something to draw us back together and most importantly, the power of an exciting, challenging idea and it's fermentation into cultism. However, where many films would just say 'This is a bad thing' 'Fight Club' doesn't. It is more a condemnation of a materialistic society which has forgotten about a large section of itself. You can empathise with these men completely, even when they band together against this uncaring society that has reared them to be something their instincts don't understand. It's as close to genius as you'll get and one film you'll talk about and think about for days."
tt0111161,"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman).Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth.If there is one complaint, it is Andy's claim of innocence. It needs to be shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from Andy's demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning. When Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail from the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an aha moment. It's a minor point, and overall this is a good prison fable."

tt1130884,"I honestly admit I didn't understood the movie,though I watch lots of movies regularly but these is beyond my limits.I never enjoyed it,whole of the whole movie.Greatest disappointment is ending of the movie.Most oftenly Hollywood movies are having positive mood with happy end, where our beloved main lead character wins.Here whole scenario is different.I felt cheated at the end, our hero is the main victim who is being manipulated by rest of the cast. Pace of the movie,another aspect where movie disappoints,sequence of event doesn't keep me on the edge,It was difficult to have attention on the screen.Its better to do anything else than watching these movie"
tt0120815,"I think this film is terrible.  The war scenes are gimmicky, especially the flanging, shakey camera work.  Some scenes are outrageously unrealistic, such as when those American soldiers shot the Germans using the mirror. Also, studies have been done showing that only about 1/3 of American troops landing during D-Day fired their rifles.  Not all of these soldiers were hardcore killers like the movie makes them out to be.  It's laughable that people call this film ""realistic.""The audience is given very little credit.  The dialogue sounds like it is cut out of newspaper articles which editorialize the mission.  It's as though Spielberg thought his audience was so stupid that the moral dilemma of the film had to be spelled out for them in detail.It also overused action sequences.  Those in creative control of the film tried to make up for the lack of depth with gritty, excessive scenes of violence.  All in all, this is one of the worst films that I have ever seen."
tt0120737,"""One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.""""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is an exhilarating and unforgettable start to a three-part adventure series. Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the most universally acclaimed projects in the world. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of the long-running franchise. It mainly focuses on establishing the setting, mythological figures, places emphasis on worldbuilding, and sets up the next two films in the trilogy. The story primarily follows Frodo Baggins as he tries to resist the power of the ring and to not succumb to the dark side. Smeagol aka Gollum is the ringmaster, while Frodo Baggins is the ring-bearer. The ring was forged by the dark lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom. The ring grants immortality, but it also unlocks your deepest darkest desires and lowers one's inhibitions. Even though he is the protagonist, Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins is the blandest character introduced in the film. The inclusion of non-diegetic music enhances the tension and suspense of the scenes in the film like Gandalf's unfortunate demise. Peter Jackson manages to precisely capture the beauty of Middle Earth and the subtleties of the mythological figures represented in the film. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is an ambitiously crafted epic fantasy with stunning imagery, memorable characters, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences, a gripping narrative, a powerful score, and magnificent costumes and set design. Peter Jackson's craftsmanship and sheer level of detail is incredible and left me in awe.Memorable lines:""Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.""""Embrace the power of the ring or embrace your own destruction.""""There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only one who can bend it to his will. And he does not share power.""""You shall not pass.""""To bear a ring of power is to be alone.""""Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.""Final verdict: 8.5/10."

tt0120737,I've seen this movie and I dont see what all of the fuss is about. Its not that great and i dont know why people think it is. I struggled to stay awake and fell asleep several times trying to watch this movie. It a tedious movie and once you finally get into the movie it ends.I'm not saying it was a horribly bad movie or anything I just dont understand why people think it is so good.
tt0108052,"SCHINDLER'S LIST is perhaps one of the ultimate anti-war movies in existence. Directed by Steven Spielberg in a naturalistic, unfussy style, it's a harsh, black and white epic that looks at the extermination of the Jews at the hands of the Nazis. Some humanity is brought to the fold by an excellent Liam Neeson who plays Oskar Schindler, a businessman who somehow found himself involved in the situation and who did the right thing. Like many Spielberg films, this is shamelessly sentimental, but then it can hope to be nothing else given the subject matter. The stirring music combines with the expert direction to make this an effortless watch, complemented by Ralph Fiennes whose role is the personification of evil."
tt0120815,"This movie serves two purposes: a) glorify the American soldier from World War II and the American nation in general and b) help Mr. Spielberg overcome his own neurosis about being Jewish, a task he started with ""Schindler's List."" That probably makes him the envy of anyone who ever saw a psychologist: to get paid for spreading out your psyche instead of having to pay for it.The first 20 minutes of this movie are amazing, indeed. Very well captured is the sheer horror of landing on a fortified beach; the disorientation, the killing etc. But after that, this movie drops on the level of ""Armageddon"": a mother has a number of sons, all of them died during the war, except one and the US military surely puts the life of half a dozen soldiers into peril to save that last one. Of course, that is completely logical.The German soldiers, in the contrary, don't seem to have mothers or anyone who cares about them, they are ugly, lean-mean-killing machines, shouting incomprehensible things and should be killed wherever possible. They are also not just as scared as any other simple soldier on a battle field, they don't have any feelings at all.So, what could have been a great movie, with all the money spent for and stars on it, playing in the same league as ""All quiet on the Western Front"" gets to be completely pathetic, unrealistic, super-patriotic and one-sided. Steven Spielberg once said that he often didn't feel he was a ""real"" American and was left-out because of him being Jewish and that the past of his family haunts him. It is ok to feel that way and I wish him he will finally get rid of both feelings. But on the other hand he also was left out of getting an ""Oscar"" until ""Schindler's List."" That was a well done movie, but on the long run it seems it didn't do Spielberg too good. Somewhere he must have come to the conclusion that doing movies about WWII helps him overcome his problems and making them patriotic will help him getting an Oscar.If you are interested in a realistic look on war, watch ""All quiet on the Western Front"" or ""Das Boot."""
tt0361748,"This starts out silly/cool, getting sillier by the minute and ends up something like a twelve year old's revenge-fantasy of what should have happened to those meanie Nazis. Sort of like Abbot and Costello Meets the Nazis. Or The Three Stooges' Kooky Trip to G√∂ring and Hitler. I admire the hell out of QT, but this is a miss and the praise lavished on this movie is a sad case of the emperors new clothes. The key scene for me is in the Parisian cinema. With Hitler enjoying the Nazi-propaganda film. Hitler seated in medium close-up; moronically joyous at the violence inflicted on the allies by the nazi sniper on screen; slapping his knee and wheezing laughter from his sweaty face. Disgusting as his reaction may be, this is a mirror-image of the faces around you in the theater five minutes later, at his extended come-uppeance.-So, if you had the same moronic joyous reaction; I guess yet another Gloryhole got Basterdized during the showing of this movie.

tt0361748,"I have as many seen all Tarantino's work and loved the majority of it but I have also as many noticed a steady spiral downwards in his work culminating with inglorious bastards. Jackie Brown, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are three films that I could easily watch over and over again while Inglorious Bastards I had trouble sitting through once. It was the first films EVER that I contemplated walking out of. . .this might be due to the fact that I rarely go to the cinema on a whim but Tarantino carried so much credit in my book that I went on the day it opened without reading anything about the work.It seems to me that no one really has the courage to say what they think...that this movie is something they would expect from a B or even C production! The story line is absolute garbage and all though I sat through the whole 150 minutes of the film I couldn't help but think that Mr Tarantino should stay of Cocaine and maybe watch some classics again before making a movie. Inglorious Bastards is like a WW2 comedy with a Western Twist...I hated it. There is not a single part of the movie which is historical accurate including things like uniforms, weapons etc. which by the end of the movie was the least of my concern. The acting was by in large rubbish...perhaps Brad Pitts worst performance. The only light point in the movie when it comes to acting is the performance of Christoph Waltz in his role of the SS Col. Hans Landa.All in all there is not much reason to see this film...there a couple of funny moments and several well done gory scenes apart from that tickets for this film should be given away for free.All of this being said I think that this movie will be well received by the general audience who will most likely praise it for being courageous and what not but the reality is that if this movie was made by someone not famous it would have been labeled as what it is...absolute rubbish."
tt0114369,"Throughout history the Bible and its wisdom have been used as an excuse for murder. The director in ""Seven"" cleverly makes use the seven sins as Kevin Spacey's Divine permission to commit the biggest biblical sin of them all; murder! While Spacey is sacrificing his victims in the name of religion and punishing them in graphical behavior for their weaknesses; Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt appear as the prophets defending and protecting all that is good by trying to catch him. The director David Fincher keeps you on the edge of your seat as you watch each brutal murder appear across the screen and as you watch Freeman and Pitt getting closer to their killer. Freeman always appears the wiser while Pitt gets more and more engulfed with rage as the killer taunts his pursuers while punishing his victims. We the viewers, are filled with anger and wrath (one of the sins themselves), as we want the killer to be caught but we realize at the end that he wants more than that! At the end the shocking revelation takes over our minds and fills us with even greater anger as we want Spacey punished! We also want him dead for his last brutal act! We also want Pitt to kill him! The question to be asked, is the unborn child saved from been born in a world full of religious contradiction or should those who wrong us be punished without question?"
tt1853728,"I've watched it, but it was so boring that I had paused it for several months and only by force finished it so that I try to understand why it's so highly rated. And I couldn't understand it at the end.To be honest, I can only imagine that it can appeal to some public enjoying particularly white people getting slaughtered by slaves. I don't know, maybe some feeling of revenge? However since I'm positioning myself racially neutral here, I don't feel any sensations from any of the scenes regarding violence to the slaves or violence to the whites.But apart from that, there's no story (OK, I'll correct myself, there's a story, but it just doesn't get you hooked), nothing in the movie. The movie is dull and boring to watch. I regret having watched it to be honest. It's one of those movies where some people recommend you as a great movie and you trust that and end up deceived I guess.I hope this review helps others."

tt1853728,"There's been no film more divisive or more igniting in terms of strong Oscar speculation then Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained. After months of shooting, word of a last minute edit (some believe editing is still going on currently), the film has finally hit cinematic eyes and the ""final"" product is both bold and misguided. Django Unchained is big and full of Tarantino life and color that we've come to love about him. On sheer production value, it's his finest film endeavor to date. Set designs are simply gorgeous, Robert Richardson captures some beautiful shots, and Sharen Davis proves once again, she's one of the most awe- inspiring designers working today. Tarantino does go a bit ""out there"" in his choices of dialogue along with the developing and rising structure of the story. Where Tarantino succeeds is in digging some terrific performances out of his principal cast, even if his film is at times lunky, problematic, and a bit messy.In the opening title sequence, Tarantino uses one of the best film theme songs this century and setting up ""Django"" for an audacious roller coaster ride. The film tells the story of Django (Jamie Foxx) who with the help of his mentor Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) becomes a bounty hunter in the 1800s and sets out to save his slave wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from the clutches of an evil plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).Anyone who knows my cinematic mind, knows my feelings about Jamie Foxx and his abilities as an actor. For the most part of his career, I've found him immensely overrated, though excels quite well in comedic driven vehicles. As the uneducated yet craftly-minded Django, Foxx does one of his finest works. As satisfactory as Foxx is and given the nature in which the character is written, he gives Django a needed sensitivity that lacks in this grotesquely violent portrait. This isn't to say Foxx doesn't fault. His interpretation of Django at the beginning of our tale, fresh off the slavery line and later becoming an A-list free bounty hunter is not entirely on point. Not always being believable, at least in drama, is Foxx's major flaw. Where he'll start by burying himself into a character, by the end of the three-hour finale, Foxx's natural and Foxx-mannerisms reveal themselves in an awkward fashion.When Christoph Waltz came into our lives as Hans Landa in Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds (2009), many cinematic-lovers thought their lives would never be the same. Waltz's ticks, evil grin, and astounding portrayal went on to win, very deserving, the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. As Dr. King Schultz, Waltz recaptures much of that magic and demonstrates once again, he is one of the most talented actors to grace our land in quite sometime. What Waltz demonstrates so brilliantly is how he can both inhabit the soul of a man with no remorse or fear to take life yet have this potent and clear sensitivity for humanity. A divine interpretation. Waltz is fearless, becoming a man with no obvious background, and building one of the finest portrayals by an actor this year. Simply superb.In a near-mute performance, Kerry Washington, and make no mistake, is absolutely magnetic and steals focus from every single actor in every single frame. As Broomhilda Von Shaft, Washington delivers a performance reminiscent of Holly Hunter's Ada McGrath in Jane Campion's The Piano (1993), a turn Oscar recognized and is equal in talent and execution. Besides the obvious beauty Washington naturally exhibits, her heartbreaking and bravura work stands at the top of anything she's delivered in her respectable career. Though the work is brief, and in many ways a background ornament that some might miss, without it, the film and the fable would feel simply meaningless. Washington is purely fantastic.As the flamboyant and wicked Calvin Candie, Leonardo DiCaprio steps out of his usual comfort zone and is as charismatic as I've ever seen him. When Calvin is on an even keel, telling a story, and simply on his lower register, DiCaprio excels. It's when the work hits the high notes, over-the-top anger or forced fuming yells, it can often feel stale in its execution. One thing I've noticed is that Tarantino attempts to give DiCaprio, and the character Candie, instances of an ""evil monologue,"" where the audience can find the brutality of his motivation spelled out on the screen for all to see. Tarantino attempted this in past films like Kill Bill Vol. 2 (2004) with David Carradine in the scene with the Bride and B.B. and the infamous story about the fishbowl. In most Tarantino films, this tactic works. In the newest effort, it doesn't come off as a natural disposition and simply out of character. The only conclusion I can come up with his either Tarantino doesn't fully understand his characters and/or their motivations, although he did create them, or simply the editing and the timeline didn't give him enough time to fully develop Django Unchained into the story he envisioned. With all this said, DiCaprio is still memorable and should be worth the conversation of any awards body.As the grumpy and vulgar Stephen, Samuel L. Jackson delivers his best work in years, reminding audiences that when teamed up with Quentin Tarantino, Jackson can stand next to any other actor working in the business. One of Tarantino's successes in the screenplay is the creation of Stephen, a head of house slave for Candie. Jackson is the comedic backbone of the film and steals focus from many of its performers including DiCaprio and Waltz. Also making a brief but memorable turn is the talented Don Johnson as Big Daddy Bennett, a slave owner that moonlights as something even more offensive. Making a cameo, Jonah Hill makes his mark and makes it well...Read the rest at The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)"

Tried again now, and got bored very quickly. To those people who love this film, OK, you get it. But it is not for me, sorry. Slow and kind of stupid. I love Laurence Fishburne as an actor, but a lot of the other actors are really cheesy. As for Keanu Reeves, well, quite dreadful. The sets are nothing special, and the slow-mo bits in the film really become annoying. It's a shame, because the story idea is not bad. Just needs to be a better movie."

This is why I love movies ... why imagination is the greatest human gift ... why I dream to write such creative and intelligent stories ... And still ... I don't know how to feel ...

This is how I felt when the movie ended. A second watching transported me from ecstasy in perception to ...REVIEW 2 : Originality in Conception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""It's a dazzling intelligence-challenging puzzle, but only on an intellectual level, not emotional. Why not? Should all the movies have a 'heart' beating inside ... as long as it makes yours do. Now I understand the film and love it because I decided not to care for the emotion and just try to understand the story. And with this mindset, believe me, ""Inception"" is an incredible experience. The movie is a fantasy and remains realistic in the same time, it's real because we know it's fake, but the fake world feels so real because we can technically live in. It doesn't say anything about dreams and subconsciousness, because it's all about actual and virtual reality, perceptions and intentions. As a script, it's a very impressive work from Christopher Nolan, not to mention the brilliant editing. Yes, I know I'm watching a film, but this one I value as an intricate puzzle that challenges my intelligence. ""Inception"" is like a cinematic Rubik's cube."" 9,5/10I was still loving the film, but in the meantime, starting to concede that the enjoyment was more on a technical level, on the construction of the plot and the intricacy of the script ... I admitted that the whole Mal-Cobb subplot was just plot devices to insert a melodrama, necessary to plunge us in Cobb's subconscious and inject it into Fisher's dreams, combining this way two parallel worlds, two narrative structures. In such action-driven films, 'forced' is 'flat' and melodrama must be handled carefully. The movie was perceived as excellent by my humble mind, but more in a cinematographic, geometric, almost pragmatic way ... which brings me to ...REVIEW 3 : Enthusiasm in Reception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""It's a great film that should grab the Oscars for Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Visual Effects, Sound Effects, Best Cinematography. If it didn't, there would be no justice!"" 8/10I knew I enjoyed the movie because as I mentioned before, it featured great thrills, action, script, music, editing, visuals ... hence the word 'sensational' I used in the beginning of this review. But as I titled in another review : ""many elements of greatness don't necessarily make a great film"". I started to question myself. It's a film about dreams, about subconscious, right? but did I sense a real escapism in those supposedly dreamy settings? didn't those dreams look a little bit like micro-episodes from formulaic action films? could the fights (or anything for that matter) be more imaginative? did the Mal-Cobb subplot make me feel sympathy for any of them? did I really care for Cobb? or did Leo make me care for his character? did I care for the whole mission? did any of the characters appeal to me? So many interrogation marks leading me to the ""Limbo"" review ...REVIEW 4 : Realism in Deception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""Wow ... this movie has a really strange power, it leaves me ecstatic when it finishes, and then the more I think about it, the more I realize that the very aspect that made me love the film could've been handled in a better way and with a deeper characterization: less chase scenes and shootings, more imagination and by that, I mean more beautiful settings and creative plot devices ... This movie is a cinematic experience that makes you scratch your head and hold your breath, but does it deserve all the praise? I wonder how I fell for this one, but I think it's time to retract myself and admit my judgment mistake. Yes, the movie is a cinematic Rubik's cube, but I guess I forgot how I used to get quickly bored by this game. How did I change my mind ? ... I don't know ... thinking, reading, realizing, sharing views, using this mind ""Inception"" tried to twist ... A very creative film, I wish it will win all the Oscars previously mentioned, but beyond the creativity of the concept ... what did I enjoy? I guess only the concept, the rest was just ... all flash and no substance"" 6/10Yep, the rating also fell through 4 ""layers"" ... what a painful awakening, this movie amazed me so much, I couldn't feel anything negative about it ... and one thing for sure, ""Inception"" has the weirdest power of attraction when you watch it for the first time, that's why I understand its popularity. It's like my mind had already accepted the idea that the movie would be a masterpiece just because it relied on a particularly innovative concept. Or was I just victim of an ""Inception"" called Marketing?"
tt1345836,"The problems with this mess of a movie are endless. Mainly, it's just boring and completely unbelievable...and way too long. There's not nearly enough Batman and, when he is on screen, he mostly gets his ass kicked. Meanwhile the villains are capable of doing everything successfully. As a result, Batman just comes off as tired and lame. The movie's war scenes smack more of Iron Man than Dark Knight. The movie desperately tries to prove how bad-ass Bane is, but he's just...not. Truly, I expected a scene with Bane loading cancer surviving, crippled grandmas into a bus and blowing them up. It was that silly. All the subplots slow things down: I could care less about the backstory of the chick with the accent, Robin (gee, I didn't see that coming two hours before it happened), the corporate stuff, Alfred's blubbering. Dull, dull, dull. Lastly, the sound is amateur. Everything is pushed up front, so it's often difficult to understand dialogue. Just a disorganized mess."

tt0372784,"After Tim Burton reinvented Batman for the movies in 1989 with his darker and disturbed vision.The subsequent sequels directed by Joel Schumacher got sillier and campier. Also Warner Brothers could not keep hold of their dark knight. The replacements Val Kilmer and George Clooney just did not look right in the batsuit.Christopher Nolan was bought in to launch a new series of films. He went back to basics with a prequel and a reinvention of the character.The first third of the film is an origins film. Bruce Wayne travels the world learning combat and find his purpose in life. He encounters the League of Shadows led by Ra's al Ghul in the Far East. However Wayne rejects their twisted message of destroying Gotham.He returns to Gotham as Bruce Wayne the playboy, his family company being run by an unscrupulous executive.However Gotham is a corrupt cesspit run by organised crime. Wayne develops his Batman persona with the aid of prototype technology developed by Lucius Fox.Christian Bale does his best Clint Eastwood impression when he has his bat suit on. There is enough playfulness in his public Bruce Wayne identity.Batman Begins is a much needed return to form for the Batman movies. In part Nolan takes this opportunity to fulfil a lifelong ambition. Direct a James Bond type action adventure. The finale is very much like a Bond film."
tt0816692,"Christopher Nolan once again gives more than enough evidence that he is the most overrated director in modern Hollywood. How is it possible to have such a premise (interstellar voyage to save human race) and make such a boring movie? It beats me, but what puzzles me even more is how it is possible to make a movie with almost no character at all. What is this movie about? It's not about an interstellar voyage, that's for sure. It ain't about discoveries, either. (imagine a group of explorers who are some of the first people to land on another planet and they are excited as my 90+ year-old grandmother is when she cooks dinner) It ain't about aliens either. It ain't about saving humanity either, there is hardly any people shown except for one village somewhere in USA. Can you really tell a story that big by wrapping it around just a few people? In theory you can and it could actually work if it made any sense. But to end the movie they it was done here, by placing a portal inside a black hole which is designed to connect only two specific people, two specific people who have accidentally found NASA's basement top-secret James Bond project - it is beyond me. Once Cooper started texting his daughter in Morse code through this portal I felt embarrassed. I felt embarrassed for Nolan brothers. That's it? That was the grand idea which connects the loose ends and saves humanity? I wish Matt Damon had killed them all, it would have been more interesting and much more plausible than this mess. His anger actually makes sense, who wouldn't be frustrated with a plot like this?I believe a big portion of estimated 165 million dollar budget went into paid reviews here on IMDb."
tt1345836,Way longer than it had to be. Bale is still not good. Bad acting by levit. Only good thing about the film was Anne Hathaway. Second one was better. First and 3rd were just ok.
tt7286456,"Despite an extraordinary performance from Phoenix, the film itself is a sub-par experience. It's Taxi Driver lite, from someone who has seen the far superior film and completely failed to grasp its meaning."
tt0133093,"The Matrix is terrible. A complete abomination. And the sequels are even worse. The only worse movie series is The Planet of the Apes. Your money would be much better spent buying a homeless person lunch.Granted it seems mildly clever at first, but it is actually an underdeveloped story with a completely unsatisfactory resolution. Any comparison to Star Wars or the Lord of the Rings trilogy would an insult the clear superiority of Lucas or Jackson as both film makers and story tellers.I hope the people that profited so greatly from this film can find a way to do something with that money that is socially responsible. Having said all of that, acting was actually OK, though.And the only part of the story that makes the least bit of sense is that technology and artificial ""intelligence"" can be dangerous instead of helpful if abused."
tt0167260,Lord Of The Rings:Return Of The King was everything I expected it to be and no more. Don't get me wrong it was great and all but nothing special. It was the best by far but it just wasn't as special. I think that is because Peter Jackson used all the eye candy(special effects) in the first two so he had nothing new to show us and that is slightly disapointing. Overall I give this movie a 8.5(for pip being so cute) out of ten. I must thank the cast and crew for I enjoyed your journey on this mission...quest........thing

tt0251661,"Modern Greek Cinema? is there such a thing? over the past few years there seems to be a sudden rise in the number of movies produced in Greece. Such is the popularity lately, that Greece has even got a film festival in Salonika which invites Greek as well as international director's work. One of winners of this festival in 2002 was ""Dekapentavgoustos"".Dekapentavgoustos is a Greek National holiday, which is celebrated every 15th of August, to mark Virgin Mary's day. The word ""Dekapente"" means 15 and ""avgoustos"" means August. Combine the two and you have 15th of August.The movie shows three different stories, occurring in parallel on this day of celebration. Some-one may recall the Latin American movie 'Amores Perros' which has the same format... It is about three different families which leave Athens, the capital, to go on holiday -but they all end up in different situations.The movie starts off with a 'feel-good' factor as the protagonists embark on their holidays and ends up with emotional tears as the story takes up a very unexpectedly different path. If you like sunny-Mediterranean cinefile movies you will love this film. It has it all- melodrama, comedy, action, love... a ""first"" for the Greek movie business -a must-see!"
tt0429078,"If the action scenes were removed, this film would have been painfully boring.With the film reaching a very long and tedious 2 hours and 20 plus minutes, I expected the movie to be at least logical. However, some scenes outright stupid or ludicrous. For example, why would someone even pay for the heads of children and women when the imperial edict was to ban martial arts? So the bandits just attack helpless villagers and get paid? Then there was a scene when the leader said to free the horses so the villagers can escape. Why would do that? Then when the two swordsmen freed the horses, one horse named Rifle, was following them. The two swordsmen had to hurry and hide from Rifle. But after they can't see the horse anymore, one of the swordsmen hurriedly and repeatedly shouted out the horse's name, presumably to say goodbye. Stupid. I thought they were trying to hide awhile ago from that same horse? How about when Green Pearl and the other swordsman decided to go to the general's fortress to loot its gold? How could the two quickly get out of the cave when the whole place is under siege with cannons and the general's army is all over the place? Then the two was immediately back in the general's fortress. Then, surprisingly, the general is back in his fortress with his army and cannons no less to surprise the Green Pearl and her companion swordsman. That was some fast transportation back then, eh? Maybe I fell asleep watching this overly long movie so I missed the explanations for the above scenes. Given that if you take out the action scenes, the film would be boring, I would not be surprised to fall asleep in the first place.The cinematography is OK, although the viewer can see the obvious camera filters effects that were used. In many scenes, the ""afternoon effect filter"" was so obvious that even plants had the orangy/afternoon lighting on top and normal color on the bottom.Over all, the film is mediocre and trying to be ""artistic"" but came out flat, illogical, and boring. The action scenes were entertaining and bound to wake up the viewer. The rest of the film is bound to make the viewer fall asleep."
tt0468569,"Seeing it rated as the third best movie of all time by IMDb voters, and ranking up huge box office, I thought I'd give it a swing.I mostly wish I hadn't bothered. Like most super-hero movies nowadays, it's one gigantic battleship of a movie, weighed down by its humongous budget and massive running time. How many sub-plots do we need? How many conflicted characters, staring into the depths of their pompous souls? Visually - great. And the vfx crew have to be credited for some of the most seamless and impressive work ever done, on the city, the batmobile, the bat bike etc. Brilliant stuff.But the story, the script, the pacing - all pretty blaah. Did I give a damn about any of the characters? Did I really care what was going to happen next? Nope. Did I actually know what was going on half the time, what with the various criminals, their money, the money laundering guy, the Joker, the various Police Departments (what the hell is ""County""?). No, no, no. Boring. I was actually looking at my watch.The one intriguing episode in the film - with the ferries - is shoved in three quarters of the way through the film, and unceremoniously dumped once it has served its purpose in sticking other bits of the film together.So, all in all, I wish I'd spent the time some other way."
tt0172495,"In German there is a good expression for movies such as Gladiator (G): ""Historienfilm"" -- it means that it is a movie which has a historic backdrop, but is not a movie ABOUT history.  What worries me is that many people will think that G is realistic, that the historic context of it or even the entire story are accurate, which is not the case.I found the movie definitely too long -- it would be much better if it had been cut by 45 or 60 minutes.  The story line was too pompous, without much suspense, and ordinary.  The ""look and feel"" (camerawork, lighting, sound track, decoration, casting, etc.) is high quality, though too glossy and commercial - like for my taste.  As for believability -- oh well.  Maybe seen from America ancient Germany is just a quick horse ride away from Rome and right next to a gladiator training center in the middle of the desert, but trust me -- it is not.  And I do understand that there has to be a bad guy, but did it have to be a hare - lipped, father - killing, sister - fancying, paedophile dictator?  And did the good guy have to be such a sickly - sweet mixture of George Washington, Rambo and Walt Whitman?  And -- on a slightly jingoistic note -- if the ancient Germans were such club - swinging barbarians (""hunh?  cavalry attack from back, that no fair""), how come the Romans never did capture the territory?Conclusion:  if the movie had been shortened, I would have found it OK to watch on the small screen (rental or free TV).  As it is, I did not like it. And I find it depressing that such a great director as Ridley Scott seems to have dedicated himself to producing glossy, mind numbing garbage."
tt0816692,"The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar.Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded.I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves ""behind"" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the ""black hole beyond the horizon"" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, ""all it takes is a little push ! ""*you'll have to see the movie to figure that one out.F√©lix Tardieu, November 1st, 2014"
tt0109830,"I have a difficult time watching (and reviewing) `Forrest Gump'.  Despite the brilliance of its actors, of director Robert Zemeckis, and of certain powerful scenes, I find that the overall film itself is a cynical lie.  On the surface, `Gump' is a cheerful film about the perseverance of its genuinely sweet title character.  Under that sweetness, though is a disturbing, uncomfortable message that says daring to dream is a bad idea.For the seven people who haven't seen `Forrest Gump', the film deals with the travels and troubles of one Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), an affable man with an IQ of 75 who manages to bounce around key historical events from 1950 onward in `Zelig'-like fashion.  Forrest inadvertently teaches Elvis to swivel his hips.  Forest accidentally becomes a football star.  Forest accidentally becomes a Vietnam war hero, then accidentally becomes a successful businessman.  (See a pattern?)  Throughout all his travels and misadventures, Forrest is forced to deal with adversity and hardship ¬ñ and he can never seem to fully capture the love of his childhood sweetheart Jenny (Robin Wright-Penn) ¬ñ but through sheer niceness and through blind faith in the goodness of others, Forrest invariably manages to push on through his difficulties and to triumph in life.Again, on the surface, a sweet, glowing, feel-good film.  Despite my own misgivings about the film, there's no doubt that Tom Hanks is simply awesome as Gump ¬ñ he clearly deserved the Oscar he won for the role. He gives Forrest Gump a childlike innocence, but there's more to it that that; there's a certain confidence that he exudes at all the right times, as well as insecurities at his low moments.  Forrest Gump is certainly far more complex than the simple figure he appears to be at first glance, and I can't think of any actor who could've played it better than Hanks.  Robin Wright-Penn is perfect as Jenny, who makes an astonishing journey through the years between wide-eyed to hardened cynicism to the acceptance and understanding of experience.  I'm surprised she wasn't nominated for an Oscar as well.  Gary Sinise makes a perfect counterpoint to Gump in the Vietnam era as Lieutenant Dan, another person who can't seem to travel through life quite as smoothly as Forrest does.  Combine this with a superbly paced film, with moments both funny and sorrowful (often at the same time), as well as some of the best, subtle uses of CGI effects ever put to celluloid, and `Forrest Gump' should be one of the best films of all time.  Right?In my opinion, no.  `Gump' is a bitter, bitter movie.  Look at Jenny's dreams and aspirations, how hard she works to attain them, and how little she actually accomplishes.  Ditto the dreams of Lieutenant Dan, or Gump's friend Bubba (Mykelti Williamson).  For them, their hopes never ultimately amount to anything, not without the `accidental' help of Forrest Gump, anyway.  Forrest, who has no ambitions, and never shows any true interest in doing anything, becomes wildly successful by doing nothing.  In essence, those who dare to dream in `Forrest Gump' are punished for their ambition, while those who do nothing are handsomely rewarded.  Considering that some of Jenny's dreams (and Lieutenant Dan's) are particularly selfish ¬ñ in fact, a few are downright noble ¬ñ I found this little understated message to be incredibly disturbing.  It bothered me enough to make me not like this film at all, despite all the wonderful moments it does contain.`Forrest Gump' gets an overall grade of a C+ -- it starts out as an `A', but its dark underlying cynicism drags it back down to that level.  But hey, I could be wrong.  It's simply the Mad Reviewer's opinion.  Good or bad, there's some great performances, and it's also thought-provoking.  Watch it for yourself, and let me know what you think."
tt0372784,"A lot would argue that ""Batman and Robin"" was the worst Batman movie of the whole series, and that is something I have to agree on. However I feel ""Batman Begins"" is the worst interpretation of Batman ever. I admit I was not too happy with the reinterpretation that occurred with ""Batman Forever"" but that I could live with because there was still a lot of amusing and visual elements to it that made it watchable. ""Batman Begins"" on the other hand is heavy handed and a little too much so to the point that it becomes abysmal and practically unwatchable early on in the first act. I found it becoming tedious with Bale delivering lines like an automaton and even though I think he's a good actor and liked him in other roles, he just wasn't Batman and did not fit the role well enough. As for seasoned actors Freeman, Oldman, and Caine popping in this mish mesh I have no idea what on earth they were thinking. They just made it more grating to bear. Caine has a lot of cred and has been in many superior films but it was actually depressing watching him tread through this sloppy disjointed sludge. He needs to retire. And the less mentioned about the dreadful and miscast Katie Holmes aka Mrs. Cruise the better. I think this was very much catered to the current MTV generation with extremely short attention spans and little imagination. This movie did not amuse or fancy me the way previous Batman films did. In fact it did not entertain me in that way at all, and for that reason I found it to be without value whatsoever. I say why even bother making a Batman film that is so abysmally dull and dim."
tt0139414,"Lake Placid was a must-see for me and when I finally saw it on video, I must say I was really disappointed. The acting is terrible, the story is flat and the crocodile looks fake. The comedy is the only thing that keeps you entertained.Bridget Fonda plays Ally, a scientist who has found a leg-less guy who has been bitten by something mysterious in Black Lake which is ages away from where she is. Ally goes exploring with another bunch of people where she finds a cow eating crocodile and a very upset granny croc.Don't see this, try ""Deep Blue Sea"" instead."
tt0114369,"This is by far the finest serial killer movie of all time. The script is beautifully paced and original with a fantastic twist at the end. The acting is superb, everyone is on the top of their game. Morgan Freeman shows his versatility and superb natural ability in the role of retiring detective Somerset, Brad Pitt gives the performance of his career as the young feisty Dectective Mills and Gwyneth Paltrow is fantastic as his highly sympathetic and caring character of his wife Tracy. But of course it is Spacey who steals the show as the compelling chilling ""John Doe"".His entrancingly calm and chilling performance lifts the picture above many others of its genre and his pure evil glint is just as chilling even more so than Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs"".I believe that Se7en is far far superior to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and others of its kind. It was one of the greatest films of the 90's (for me second only to ""The Usual Suspects"") and i feel is constantly underrated by many. I am glad to see it at #36 although i feel it is worthy of the top 20.This is David Fincher's finest hour as a director with his drab rainy surroundings adding a superb drab atmosphere to a drab city. Andrew Kevin Walker's script is however will be what remembered as an incredible story, perfectly crafted and acted out beautifully by Spacey, Freeman, Pitt and co.A MUST SEE FILM FOR EVERY FAN OF GREAT 90's MOVIES, ONE OF THE DECADES GREATEST."
tt0172495,"Gladiator is an epic film in its reach and grandeur. It shoots for the stars and occasionally reaches, but the weak script prevents it from it's aspirations of greatness. Crowe's performance received the lion's share of attention but for me it's Phoenix performance that really drives this film. The cinematography, costumes, direction, and score are all excellent and raise the film to a thoroughly entertaining experience."
tt0111161,"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. If you haven't watch it yet, just GO! Watch it! Now!"
tt0172495,"Now don't get me wrong, Gladiator is not a bad film, it simply isn't as good as everyone seems to be saying it is.  For some reason it has captured the imagination of what I call the James Bond audience, the people who only go to the movies once or twice a year and this has artificially inflated it's rating. There are plenty of other people writing about how good the film is, so I'm going to concentrate on it's flaws.Firstly, it is far too long.  Clearly the producers wanted to make an epic like in the old days, but they seemed to have assumed that epic means length.  Wrong!  I'm sure a half-decent producer could have taken at least half and hour out of the film.  It takes far too long to get going.  After the inital battle, which for me was the high-point of the film, there is no action for about 45 mins.  This is the point where the plot takes place. The problem is, the characters are all so cardboard that the audience can easily work out what the plot is about, and five minutes here would have been more than ample.The fight scenes were some of the worst I have ever seen.  You would think Ridley Scott (or his second unit director) would have seen The Matrix, a Jackie Chan film, or at least one Martial Arts film.  That is how to direct an interesting fight; long, stationary shots showing off the skills of the stuntmen, not close-ups and constant irritating cutting on movement.  It was impossible to work out what was going on in most of the fight scenes.Thirdly, there is far too much CGI.  Yes it was impressive to recreate the Coliseum, but then they ruin the effect with overkill.  And the CGI tigers were absolutely awful.  Surely real tigers would have been cheaper and far more impressive.Fourthly, historical accuracy...  oh we don't need to bother with this, after all, it's only a movie...And don't forget the wonderful array of accents!I can't help comparing the film to Ben Hur or Spartacus and I'm afraid that Gladiator comes a poor second in terms of story and spectacle."

Someone else recommended alternative prison flicks Kiss of the Spider Woman and Cool Hand Luke.  I heartily agree with those choices."
tt0372784,"The fact that it's a Batman movie and that it's jam packed with stars just wasn't enough to float my boat. The acting? Peachy. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are great actors. And sure, I feel that Christian Bale was a great choice for the next Batman (naturally, anyone will do to wipe out the memory of Clooney). But where was the thrill? The entertainment? In Burton's Batman, Michael Keaton's Batman shows himself right off the bat (no pun, I swear), taking out thugs and strutting his weaponry--examples of his weaponry and his prowess multiply as the movie moves along. In ""Begins"", a scenes are wasted with Batman either hiding in the shadows snatching up villains, or the fight scenes are slapped together, the frames flickering by too quickly to see any real hand-to-hand. There was no intensity to this movie, no drive; okay, the bat-tank tears up the street--but that was the longest action sequence! Whoopty-doo! I read a review that said that his movie was 1000 times better than Spiderman 2. Pppppleeeeasseee. This movie just seemed thrown together. I was so bored. Really."
tt0114369,"Seven has become a huge public success all over the world. That I can understand. What I find more surprising is that it also got well received by the critics. Most praised it as well made, exciting and original thriller. Some even thought it was a masterpiece. But in my opinion, Seven doesn't provide the genre of police thriller noting new than dim lighting and copious amount of rain.Because Seven has much more in common with other films in this genre than most people realized. A couple of clich√©s are that there's a team of two cops who investigates the case consists of an old black man who is tired of his job and look forward to his retirement. The other one is his opposite; a young white man who wants up.The murders that Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (Brad Pitt) are investigating has been done with the seven deadly sins as source of inspiration. The killer also leaves short literature quotes. Mainly Dante, something that makes  Somerset (of course the intellectual of the two cops) take Mills (who only seems to read Guns and Ammo) to the library.Director David Fincher - whose only feature film before this was Alien 3, but loads of music videos behind - reasoned ""I don't feel at home in libraries either... What music should I pick? It has to be something cultural. At least we take something that everybody recognizes - Air by Bach.Seven doesn't have any other intentions than being the two hour thriller with some disgusting corpses, an odd police couple and a crazy killer it actually is. Then it should be regarded as such and nothing more."
tt7286456,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.
Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.
Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message.
It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too.
The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different.
It's BELIEVABLE.
There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people.
Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film."
tt0397103,This movie is underrated. Love this film - it's inspirational with great heart. I'm a long time fan of Mika Boorem and really enjoyed seeing her in this role. I thought everyone did a great job. This film is overall a really scenic enjoyable film with great directing and acting.
tt0137523,"I'm sorry but this movie is outrageously horrible. I get the appeal but a reveal does not make the first hour and a half not horrible. The characters are outrageous to a fault, and the story is jumbled. Great reveal but does not counter out the flaws."
tt0372784,This movie was absolutely dreadful. Christian Bale as Batman was just absolutely ridiculous not to mention Michael Caine with his accent. There were several points in the movie I burst out laughing at Bale's delivery of lines. It was like he practically growled as if to sound menacing. I think the public at large just has no idea what is an accurate portrayal of Bob Kane's comic character. To me the closest I think was the original 1989 Batman movie. The absurdity of Batman Begins was how serious it was trying to be which made you laugh at it rather than with it. The Scarecrow was the most disappointing villain of any of the previous Batman films. He was completely boring and just downright stupid. This film was such a complete insult to the fans who have stuck with the movie series through the good sequels and the bad. Unfortunately a new generation of children think this is cooler than a Batman that makes much more sense and has an element of fun to it. Tedious and bland is the only way to describe this new reinvention of the Dark Knight. Next!
tt1130884,"Despite the intriguing trailers to this Scorsese film, it was not worth spending the money on. I thought this movie would be a slam dunk, instead it was a slam junk. The movie was not suspenseful, exciting, and thrilling as I had hoped. An idea of a isolated island, creepy mental patients and missing woman set in the 50's. Great concept however the story line fell apart. I will say the acting was good, Leonardo DiCaprio and Michelle Williams gave great performances. I did all I could to keep my eyes open through this 2hr 18min movie. I was left confused and unsatisfied. Trust me, you will be too.I suggest you spend your money on Avatar and wait for Shutter Island on DVD."
tt0111161,"If there was such a thing as a perfect movie, this is it. Of course, for practical reasons, one cannot award a film ten stars out of ten, because of the endless stream of new work demanding scrutiny. I'd like also to start by quoting another well known film, which sums up my opinion nicely. 'In many ways, the work of a critic is easy- we risk very little, and thrive on negative criticism, which is amusing to write and to read. But the harsh truth of the matter is that the average piece of junk is probably more valuable than our criticism designating it so'. This could not be closer to the truth. When it comes down to the wire, critics risk everything in dishing out praise, for fear of being ridiculed themselves.There can be no such danger with The Shawshank Redemption. It is an eternal masterpiece, timeless and inspiring. I avoid being clich√©d, when it is at all possible to do so, but The Shawshank Redemption is beautiful, masterfully acted, with just that right amount of tenderness. This is a tale of moral courage, and the everlasting fight for justice. As with other films of the genre, one can tell what will happen, of course, but when you watch this film, you will time and again be genuinely surprised, and maybe even shed a tear for the persistence and unquenchable thirst of the human spirit. One leaps for joy after watching this incredible film, at the knowledge that evil, in all senses of the word, can, and will never triumph.Turning an eye to the technical side of things, just for a moment, I can discern not one single badly executed shot. The Shawshank Redemption is well written, and, as I have said before, brilliantly acted. Characters that could be flat are all allowed to develop and flourish, and the film is even better for it. The film grabs our attention, right from the word go, with agitated shots of Andy looking like he IS going to kill his wife. And the soundtrack. Well, there isn't much to say; except that most of the music in this film is some of the most beautiful I have ever heard.This is a deeply satisfying, wonderful, brilliant, fantastic, soulful cinematic work. Watch it, if you haven't seen it, and if you have, you must agree that this excellent film will be an eternal classic. There are, of course, films that people will prefer, I myself am strongly attracted to Subway, a 1985 film by Luc Besson, but for pure facial and objective value, cinema does not get much better than this."
tt0068646,"Think epic novel crossed with Mafia speak.Imagine excellent cinematography and direction, a great musical theme, violence, tragedy, spectacle, and the family, and a cast which can't be faulted, and here you have a film which fits the bill on all counts.Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in one of his greatest roles, one which he supposedly didn't initially want to play) is the powerful Mafia Don we meet early in the film. He has three sons (Sonny - James Caan; Fredo - John Cazale; and Michael - Al Pacino) and a daughter (Talia Shire), and an adopted son (Tom Hagen - Robert Duvall). These are his beloved family and the centre of his world. His day job involves building his empire by making 'offers you can't refuse'.'The Godfather' was the first film in a trilogy following the fortunes of the Corleone family, and I think the best. It has some well-presented set pieces (Connie's wedding; Sonny's murder; Michael's killing of family enemies in the restaurant; the horse's head in the bed; and Vito's death while playing with his grand-child) and is extremely well-written. The novel itself was more soapy, a work of pulp fiction - the film pulls it together and gives it a bit more class.I particularly like the characterisations of Vito and his sons. Vito is assured in his role at the head of the premier Mafia family. Sonny is a vain libertine who is hot-headed. Fredo is a weak disappointment. Michael takes his place in the family when he has to (in fact throughout the three films he is shown to be far more ruthless than any of his relatives).Is 'The Godfather' the greatest film ever made? No, but it is one of the best. Certainly in the top 10 films of the 1970s."
tt0993846,"The 2013 film of Jordan Belfort's The Wolf of Wall Street novel begins with Leonardo DiCaprio breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly to the audience. He does this repeatedly throughout the film and if he is not speaking directly to the audience, he is doing lots of voice-over to explain or inform what he or the other characters are doing at that particular time/situation in the film. Most of the time, I find voice-over very distracting, but I have to admit that it works in this dramedy film very well. The book, written by Jordan Belfort, a former New York stock broker who earned hundreds of millions of dollar during the 1990s at his Stratton Oakmont brokerage firm on Long Island, New York (not really Wall Street in downtown Manhattan). The book is very long and seems to glorify everything Belfort did during this time of his life along with all of his friends and co-workers at his stock firm. He founded this firm which started as a penny stock firm, where unfortunately he defrauded everyday ordinary investors with fraudulent stock sales. Considered a stock swindler, he developed a very severe lifestyle, which included a very serious addition to Quaaludes. The company at one point employed well over 1,000 brokers and dealt with more than $1 billion stocks, including the Steve Madden show company. The 2000 film Boiler Room was inspired by Belfort and Stratton Oakmont. It should be noted here that Belfort was indicted in 1998 for money laundering and securities fraud. He spent 22 months in a federal prison and was to pay back $110.4 million that he swindled. Meeting Tommy Chong of Cheech and Chong in prison, Belfort was persuaded to write and publish his story, which he has. Stratton Oakmont was considered a boiler room that manipulated stocks. In the book, he tells in full detail how he did it from money laundering to swindling customers. Millions poured in, bringing with it many excesses, which included women, drugs, huge homes, servants, yachts, aircrafts, not only for himself but for everyone who worked for him. He also describes in detail all his dope escapades and sex, despite constantly telling the reader how much he loved his wives, particularly his second (and now ex-wife) and his children. Again, in full detail, he tells the reader about the supporting characters, from Aunt Patricia, his father who he calls Max Max, the Swiss forger, his cohorts in crime at Stratton, along with Steve Madden and others. The drug use, the sex, the violence, the storm at sea that destroyed his yacht, and the car wrecks are all listed throughout the book. It finally ends with Belfort being arrest and jailed. In the film, which is considered a black comedy, the story deals with the scam that Belfort initiated and where, or not, some, any, or all of what he tells the reader what he did during this time in the book is accurate remains to be seen. As is always the case with any film, plenty of creative license is used to tell a particular story. Seeing how Martin Scorsese, the director, in all his films, tries to be as faithful to the novel as he can be, he has done the same with Belfort's memoir. So this particular film is a close adaptation since most of the story elements are kept while some have been changed, added, or dropped. But, one has to be reminded that Belfort was a true scam artist, so just how much of his story is legit is up to the reader and now the watcher to decide. Most of what Scorsese has included in this film is accurate based on the book. Mark Hanna, played well by a still very thin Matthew McConaughey from his role in Dallas Buyer's Club, tells a very young Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) that the key to being successful included hookers, cocaine and masturbation is told in the novel. The use of what is called a pump-and-dump scheme (selling a risky stock at an inflated price and then sold the stock to make a profit for themselves) to make a profit is also accurate. Belfort and Danny Porush (Donnie Azoff in the film, played by Jonah Hill) did this. The brokerage firm did in reality take Steve Madden's shoe company public, which Madden, Belfort and Porush owned the stock, driving the price up. All three of them went to jail for this. The smuggling of the money that Belfort laundered in Switzerland was actually done by his wife's mother and English aunt. Prostitutes were hired and were billed to the corporate credit card and then these expenses were written off their taxes. The yacht, originally owned by Coco Chanel, was sunk. In the film, his second wife's name was Naomi; in the novel, her name is Nadine. In the book, Belfort gave up Porush, among many others for a reduced sentence. In the film, he tells Porush not to incriminate himself. It is true that Belfort was born in the Bronx to accountant parents and he was raised Jewish which he is still today. I guess the audience would like to believe that Belfort only stole from the rich. Truth be known, many small investors are still to this day trying to recover from his scheme while Belfort has failed to repay what he owes and Porush is still doing his get rich quick plans. Many of the characters; names from the book were changed. Danny Porush is Donnie Azoff, Patrick Denham (FBI agent) is in real-life Gregory Coleman, Denise Lombardo was changed to Teresa Petrillo and Nadine Caridi was Naomi Lapaglia. Chandler was the name of his first child, but was referred to in the film as Skyler. Scorsese did include at the end of the film a disclaimer saying it was a fictionalized version of the novel and in the film, some of the names had been changed."
tt0137523,"I won't spoil the plot for you if I say that ""Fight Club"" is about guys who like to fight each other, no holds barred. I'm an action movie buff, so I thought it might be fun and cartoony. I like Jackie Chan, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc. But I hated this film.The violence is very real and awful. There is a lot of pretentious art crap (such as Brad Pitt appearing for brief flickers of time), and the film is similar to war films whose sole purpose is to show you the horror of war. I've got enough problems without psychological trauma, thank you very much.Plus, the characters are incredibly unbelievable. When you fight someone in real life and do real damage, the human reaction is you go to a hospital, you think ow ow ow ow, and you think I'd better stop fighting. No. These guys eat it up and turn it into a hobby. That's psychopathic.Who should see this film:-- film school types: go crazy, have a blast watching the blood-- action movie types with a strong lack of empathy for suffering. And stay away from my daughter.Sorry, but at least I've stated some intelligent reasons for giving Fight Club a worst-of-the-worst 1 out of 10."
tt0848228,"I am a big fan of science fiction. I have not been such a big fan of all movies based on comic books. I am not such a big fan of sequels either. The Avengers was a must-see-film for me, for several reasons, but most of all, I enjoyed both Iron Men, Captain America, and a bit of Thor as well. Hulk did not do the trick to me.The Avengers brings all these superheroes together. Their opponent is Thor's evil half-brother, Loki. His main goal is to get a magical stone, or cube, that would open the gateway to another dimension, to Asgard, where other, even more evil forces await to be released, and freed to the world of the humans.The action in the film, along with the SFX, is great. However, the storyline is not something you have not seen or heard before. Actually, there is very little new to the film. Also the decision to get all the superheroes or stars together, does not really differ much from Expendables, which is somewhat huge phenomenon, even though the script could be written by a 12-year-old.The Avengers is a lot better than Expendables, but that does not mean, it is a whole lot better, and that it would be better than, lets say Iron Man. For me Iron Man alone stands above The Avengers. The film does not come better with bigger explosions, and a lot more heroes, than in the original film. But obviously, with fans of the 80's stars in Expendables, it is enough to bring them all on the screen at once.What I truly enjoyed in this film was actually a few parts of the action. The one with Thor dropping out from the sky, or the parts in the end, with the heroes pretty much destroying most of the city-site.All in all, it is certainly a-must-see for the fans of comic stars, science fiction, and action. I enjoyed, but not that much, that I would recommend it to everybody."
tt0110912,"I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines ‚Äì it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of ""chapters"" ‚Äì there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.If you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats ‚Äì and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even ""stealing"" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's ‚Äì well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
tt0120815,"The first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan is probably the most realistic depiction of war and the invasion of Normandy ever made. That being said, the plot is far fetched and the story drags out for while without anything really happening. There is very little character development and many of the characters you never really get to know all that very well.The last combat scene of the movie does not live up to the first. It was very disappointing to me personally. In reality the German military was highly trained and professional. In this movie they are reduced to cannon fodder in the last 25 min. It seems to me there was two different directors on this movie - one for the first half and one for the second half."
tt0110912,"I do not understand the hype. This movie was nothing but a waste of my time.Why? First, I believe a movie should have a clearly outlined plot so that you know what's going on. This movie doesn't feature that. It starts out of nowhere with no apparent background and has a pointless ending.There are indeed a couple of scenes that might be fun to watch if you are in the ""right mind"" (however most are violent and immature) and the actors do an excellent performance but that doesn't pump this movie up to anything good. It kind of shows you the happenings of a few drugdealers and criminals within a short timeframe, that's all.To sum it up... this movie has few redeeming qualities. Do something productive and more fun instead. Such as washing the dishes.Two stars out of ten."
tt0133093,"1959 saw one of cinema's greatest achievements, 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'. Widely regarded as the worst film of all time, it featured a plot unrivalled in absurdity.Then came 'The Matrix'. Apparently robots (or space zombies, or some variety of scary CGI monsters) have enslaved humanity, and are harvesting them for energy. To keep their living batteries entertained the robo-zombies (or space alligators, it doesn't really matter) have created a giant computer game called 'the Matrix'. With a devil-may-care disregard for the first law of thermodynamics, this game runs on the energy of the people it simulates.But some of these people break out of the computer game and live in a rusty metal bucket and eat gruel. Being heroes, they plan to overthrow their demon-squid robot overlords and free humanity, so they can all live in rusty metal buckets and eat gruel. There are some philosophical pretensions and religious references in there, but these are too simplistic and crass to be worth going any deeper into.Keanu Reeves gives a very believable performance of bad acting, while the rest of the cast mince around in sunglasses and trench-coats, delivering dialogue which serves no other purpose than carrying the plot.The first fifteen minutes of this film are quite watchable, which is why I am giving it a generous two out of ten."

tt0172495,"Gladiator is well-made and sports all the frills of a big budget production -- big sets and lotsa extras in good costumery.  However, let's be blunt, it is a 10-minute plot stretched out to epic proportions.  And, it is not a new plot.  It is not much more than a combination of Braveheart and Last of the Mohicans, go to Rome -- to name a couple of more recent films. In effect, it is hero gets done wrong and his loved ones are killed, so he bides his time and gets his revenge. I think all of the hurrah behind this film is from Hollywood having little else to offer this year at the Oscars (how else could Chocolat get nominated --$$$). Since Crouching Tiger is not part of the good ole boy Hollywood network, Hollywood is working hard to prevent a foreign film from upstaging them. In a different year, this film would not get half the recognition it is getting."
tt0361748,"Inglourious bastards Is written and directed By Quinten Tarantino, staring Christopher Waltz (Hans Landa), Brad Pitt (Aldo Raine), Michael Fassbender (Lieutenant Archie Hicoc), Daniel Bruhl (Fredrick Zoller) and Melanie Laurent as (Emmanuelle Mimieux). The movie takes place during the Nazi occupation of France. The movie starts out in Nazi occupied France where a French farmer is being interrogated by Hans Landa (Christopher Waltz), an SS trooper, as he is suspected of hiding a Jewish family for which his farm was previously searched. Hans' only mission is to find Jewish people hiding in France and exterminate them. We see this in one of the first scenes where he finds out the farmer is hiding a Jewish family under the floorboards of his house. Hans orders his troops in and they fire through the floorboards killing all but one girl who escapes, Shoshanna.Years later she changes her name to Emmanuelle Mimieux. She owns her own movie theater a dead relative left her. During this time a group of gorilla Nazi hunters lead by Aldo Raine starts a campaign to kill Nazis. After a lot of killing and Nazi heads beat in with baseball bats, they team up with British commando Archie Hicox, who studies German cinema, to attack the premier of Stolz Der Nation, a German War propaganda movie staring Fredrick Zoller. Things don't go so well and they end up getting caught. Emmanuelle, who's entire family was killed by Nazis has a parallel plan to kill everyone at the premiere. Emmanuelle along with the projectionist and her African lover Marcel who works with her, pile a large quantity of flammable cellulose Nitrate film behind the viewing screen as Marcel locks and bolts the auditorium doors closed. Emmanuelle ends up fending off one too many advances from Fredrick. She shoots him, when she goes over to see if he's dead he shoots her with his last gasp of air and they both die. Meanwhile Marcel sets the flammable reels on fire behind the screen while the movie is playing and within a few minutes the whole theater goes up in flames. No one can escape as all the doors are bolted shut and everyone inside the theater including Hitler and his top brass and Marcel die. Meanwhile Landa has the Bastards in a camp interrogating them, he knows the Nazis are losing the war so he says he will let the bastards go and will give the American military information that will win them the war if they in turn let him live out the rest of his life in America. They accept but not before Aldo takes his knife and carves a swastika into Landas forehead to let everyone always know he was a Nazi.Tarantino has a knack for bringing his movies almost to the point of absurdity, but his stylish and creative directing never gets to the point of becoming farcical or preposterous such as Hitler dying in a movie theater in Inglorious Bastards or Christopher Waltz shooting a sheriff in plain sight in Django Unchained, then walking back into a bar and having a drink while he waits for the marshal to show up, only to show him the bounty on the sheriff's head who goes by a different name and is actually wanted for murder. This play on absurdity is a theme that permeates throughout the Inglorious Bastards.To demonstrate this, we see the only Jewish survivor Shoshanna who changed her name to Emmanuelle as an adult and now owns a movie theater. We see her sitting in a caf√© enjoying coffee as a 20 something German soldier comes in and starts hitting on her. He becomes giddy as a schoolboy talking to her, completely unaware that he is part of the army that's invaded her county and killed her people, which makes the audience sit back and wonder what is going on. As he's talking to her, many German soldiers and officers recognize him with excitement. He shows genuine care and concern for her as these soldiers speak to him in German and treat him like he's LeBron James. Amused she asks what's going on and instead of lying to her he tells her the truth. He explains they recognize him as war hero because he shot and killed over 50 French troops with a sniper rifle while holed up in the top of a bell tower. Normal writers such as the show runners of The Rings of Power and Star Tek discovery would have collapsed in an incoherent mess trying to explain why a decorated German Solder who ends up becoming a war hero for Germany, by killing over 50 French troops, is genuinely trying to date a French woman and sees no problem at all with this. But this is part of the gag and Tarantino does a masterful job of teasing out the abject absurdity of the situation in a way that's both brilliant and insightful. It's the same absurd reason Inglourious is spelled wrong in the title. He masterfully subverts our reality of what absurdity is, scenes that would normally pull the audience out of the movie due to an illogical or preposterous idea (like Hitler murdered in a theater) are skillfully wrote and directed by Tarantino in a way that heightens our sense of excitement by turning a scene that's absurd and ridiculous into a scene that's genuinely funny and exciting because of the absurdity and ridiculousness of it."
tt0361748,"In 1941 Nazi-occupied France, ""The Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) finds the Dreyfus family hidden by their neighbors. Shosanna Dreyfus (M√©lanie Laurent) escapes after her family is massacred. Meanwhile Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) has gathered 8 Jewish American soldiers to kill Nazis behind enemy lines. Their brutal scalping campaign instills fear among the Germans. Donowitz (Eli Roth) is even given a nickname ""The Bear Jew"" for brutally beating Nazis with a baseball bat. Then in June 1944, Shosanna has a new name and a theater. She catches the eye of German war hero Fredrick Zoller who wants a big premiere in her theater that will attract the biggest of Nazi leaders. It even attracts the Jew Hunter as well as the Inglourious Basterds.Christoph Waltz is great as the cold menacing well-mannered Nazi. He is completely engrossing in every one of his scenes. Every word he speaks is dripping with menace. His scenes are quiet and some of the most compelling parts of the movie. Then Quentin Tarantino has injected his brutal violence into this Jewish revenge fantasy. It is nothing less than audacious and uniquely original."
tt0292194,"Creepy slice of 50's conformity forced on innocent school kids. Well...innocent?

That about sums up the cheerful message of this unintentionally hilarious short. But hey, look at school kids nowadays. Don't you just hate that sloppy look and who cares-posture? Well, that's what you get for not taking shorts like this seriously. We were warned, but we simply didn't listen. More fool us.

tt7286456,"'The Joker', a cinematic exploration of the darker corridors of society, delves into the complexities of mental health and societal neglect. The film's narrative structure is a masterpiece of storytelling, gradually unraveling the psyche of its protagonist, Arthur Fleck. His transformation into the Joker is not just a character arc; it's a disturbing mirror held up to society's failings.The thematic depth of 'The Joker' is where its true strength lies. It does more than just tell a story; it ignites a conversation about mental health in America, echoing sentiments familiar to followers of The Anarchist Symbol and Cercle Proudhon. The film's portrayal of a society that both creates and then shuns its monsters is a powerful commentary on the cyclical nature of neglect and violence.From a technical standpoint, 'The Joker' is a triumph. The cinematography masterfully captures the gritty, oppressive atmosphere of Gotham City, serving as a backdrop to Fleck's descent into madness. The score, haunting and melancholic, perfectly complements the film's tone, enhancing the emotional impact of each scene.As a fan of The Anarchist Symbol and Cercle Proudhon, one can't help but appreciate the film's raw depiction of anarchic chaos as a response to societal breakdown. It's a stark reminder of the consequences of ignoring the marginalized and the mentally ill. The film doesn't glorify this chaos but presents it as an inevitable outcome of a society that fails to address its deepest issues.The portrayal of the Joker himself is a testament to the complexities of the human mind. His actions, while extreme and morally reprehensible, are depicted with a level of empathy that forces viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about the human condition and societal responsibility.In conclusion, 'The Joker' is a film that not only entertains but also challenges its audience. It's a bold statement on mental health, societal neglect, and the thin line between sanity and madness. The film might not offer solutions, but it undoubtedly sparks a necessary dialogue, making it a must-watch for those who dare to confront the darker aspects of our society."
tt0816692,"I was very interested in this movie, my expectations were very high, luckily I have been satisfied! I can't say it's a masterpiece because I found something that could have been better ( there's an apparent hole plot and some characters could have been realized better) The plot is very difficult and articulated, science is really complicated! Besides movie is very long, but it can not bore, rhythm grows up to the end. The photography is breakthaking, scenes are spectacular and do you not fell the long-duration! screenplay is fantastic, music is fundamental for the movie ( Hans Zimmer composed a fabulous soundtrack ). The special effects are perfect, worthy of an Oscar! Unfortunately, in my opinion, Interstellar has not had the attentions it deserves it's a film you have to see! 9/10 absolutely! not to be missed!"
tt0167261,"MANY SPOILERSI loved Fellowship of the Ring.  I thought it was a classic film and a faithful adaptation of the spirit of the books.  The Two Towers is beautiful, as was FOTR, but it contains several serious flaws that make this movie more frustrating than enjoyable.  People appear averse to hearing a comparison of the movie to the books, so I will stick to criticism of the film.  The most glaring flaws in the film are:1.  The resolution of the battle of Helm's Deep is not credible.  This is a major problem because Mr. Jackson has chosen this battle as the climax of his film.  We see literally 10,000 orcs on the plain in front of the fortress.  As they are about to breach the last defense, Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas and a handful of others ride out into the fray.  At that moment, Gandalf appears on the other side of the army of orcs and charges in with what appear to be a couple hundred soldiers.  Now here is the problem:  in this situation, there is no way that Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas will live, and it doesn't appear that Gandalf can prevail given his limited numbers. Do 10,000 orcs, including hundreds of orc archers near Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas, ALL turn around and face Gandalf, forgetting completely about Aragorn and crew?  It seems much more likely that some orcs will fight Gandalf (and kill him: I didn't think he would make it past the spears set in the front line), while Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are pelted with literally thousands of arrows.  Mr. Jackson, apparently unable to resolve this problem, fades the scene out.  Not good enough.  This is the climax of the movie and it is not believable.  A fatal flaw for any picture.2.  Because the battle of Helm's Deep is the climax, we must endure almost an hour of people preparing for that battle.  They shuffle out of the city, shuffle along through fields, shuffle into the fortress, get some weapons, and just generally stand around.  This build-up is too long.  Though the battle itself is impressively filmed, it cannot support this much film.3.  The Ents, creatures who take half a day to pronounce someone's name, who have stood silently in the forest for thousands of years, decide suddenly to wreak havoc on Isengard because they see thirty feet of burned treeline. This is not in character at all.  Perhaps it was done this way to convince us that Merry has grown since FOTR.  Character development is a wonderful thing, but not at the expense of consistency in the behavior of other characters.  This moment makes the Ents, and Merry, look silly.4.  Faramir's decision to drag Frodo to Gondor does not resolve itself well. How does watching Frodo try to give the ring to a ringwraith convince Faramir to allow Frodo to take the ring into Mordor?  If anything, he should conclude that Frodo is near the end of his rope and the ring should be in other hands.These problems make the film ultimately unsatisfying to watch.  As a side note, all of these problems were caused by Mr. Jackson's decision to deviate from the books.  Here's hoping ROTK stays closer to the writings."
tt1345836,"This is one of my favorite bad movies ever. So many things in it don't make any sense. It's awfully written and the fact that this movie has an 8.4 shows that many people don't have a single braincell.FBI guys in plane instead of shooting attackers outside plane decide to start punching their tied-down prisoners so the movie can happen.Who are Bane's armed men in the first place and why do they blindly follow him?Gotham sends the entirety of Gotham's cops (3,000 in a city of 12 million compared to New York's 40,000 cops in a city of 8 million) into the sewers instead of smaller teams of Swat troopers or national guard and now they're trapped? And can't they just climb out of the manholes or is Bane's men guarding every manhole in the city?The cops charge Bane's men armed with machine guns and hardly any of the cops die and the next scene everyone is in a fist-fight?Why doesn't Bane detonate the bomb immediately? Why wait 6 months? Literally no reason because he intends to just blow it up regardless.Awful ending twist with Talia Al'Ghul that means nothing to anyone and leads to an unintentionally hilarious death scene.Batman's broken back fixed by a rope and a punch to it.All in all, not good."
tt0167261,"*****************************SPOILERS*************************************** ******** Who the heck does Peter Jackson think he is?  Tolkien?  Delete from the story for editing purposes, add a little to make it more approachable. BUT DO NOT CHANGE THE WHOLE STORY!!I couldn't even bring myself to appreciate it for a piece of cinematic art, as I was totally appalled at the changes to the storyline.  Too many to mention, but to highlight: Faramir kidnapping Frodo to Osgiliath? Aragorn falling off a cliff and falling in a river? Making a big deal about some imaginary exodus of the Rohirrim??? Elves from Lothlorien, and no ents/huorns to save Helm's Deep?The long, drawn out changes to the story totally ruined the movie.  I agree with some of the other postings that I have seen, that say it was these changes that made the movie overlength.  And the copy I saw either have been spliced, or there was some really awful edits.What a departure from FotR!!  I took my family and friends five times, bought both DVD's, movie books, etc.  Well no more, not for this trash!Jackson, you have one year to correct your mistakes.  I'll go see Return of the King, just to find out.  But you will never get one dime from me ever again, if you do as poor a job with that.  You were capable, and should have done, a better job."
tt0230379,"This film consists of a couple episodes from the British TV series ""Journey to the Unknown"" (1968)--'Poor Butterfly' (episode 1.6) and 'The Indian Spirit Guide' (episode 1.11). I have no idea if the rest of the episodes were any good, but the two used to make this full-length film were pretty good.'Poor Butterfly' is the first segment and like the other it's introduced by Sebastian Cabot. It's probably the better of the two and, interestingly, stars an American (Chad Everett) living in the UK. Out of the blue, he receives an invitation to a posh society party--though he has never met the host. Despite this, he attends this costume party--and very weird things happen.'The Indian Spirit Guide' is about a woman (Julie Harris--another American) whose husband died and she's trying to contact him through various psychics. However, again and again, her male friend exposes the psychics as frauds. But how he knows they are fake and why he delights in exposing them is something you'll have to learn about yourself--suffice to say, he gets his in the end! Both episodes are spooky and involve nice twists. While neither is brilliant, both are good and make for decent viewing. Well acted, written and directed by Hammer Films--the same folks responsible for a bazillion horror movies of the era."
tt0137523,"Sorry, gang;  I'm giving this a thumbs down.  This pic has great cinamatography and art direction but that only makes it a video, not a movie.The director and writer had a few ideas for half a movie but couldn't think of anything else while the bills piled up.  The first act was good enough but would have been better if it had made up it's mind where it was going. Too many scenes which promised something proved to be red herrings while others just plain dragged.  The last act summed up nothing which went on before;  it also introduced character relationships and elements which hadn't been seen earlier. Thus the story arc was a complete wreck.  On top of all that, the whole movie runs some 30 to 40 minutes too long.  All of which are the classic signs of poor direction and writing.  It brings to mind the fiasco that was Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991).It started out as an off-beat buddy movie and ended as cheesy, pyschodramatic wish-fulfillment shlock on a par with The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) except with a bigger budget and no catchy songs.  It calls out, `look at me!' but then says nothing else, hoping a fashionably alienated, post-ironic attitude will make up the difference.  It never did and never will."
tt0120737,"Good fantasy adventure movie , and great start to a franchise . LOTR waited for long time in my watch list , finally started to watch it .

Technically awesome , great support from the production design , incredible cinematography , well composed music . Good VFX . Overall a good engaging fantasy adventure to watch ."
tt0167260,"Now i will say without a doubt Return of the King is the best in the trilogy.The Lord of the rings trilogy has everything, action, romance, story, amazing CGI and good performances from all the cast. Unfortunately it is very slow at some parts of the movie and having read the books myself i can tell you there are huge plot holes in the story and much of it was actually changed to fit into the movie.This movie was pretty boring at some parts and a couple of my friends did fall asleep all the way up to the final 20 minutes of fight scene, one of them actually left , and i have to admit at some points i did start to nodd off.I didn't really like the character of legolas in all three movies due to fact that he was to invincible and he didn't even get dirty while fighting orcs and other demon type creatures, however the other cast and characters were done well.I think with the whole trilogy overall you ether love them or fall asleep through half of it, but they are good movies.personally though when it comes to fiction i'd rather watch Blade or Total Recall.7 out of 10."
tt0372784,"Of course, when in comparison to many of the films released this year, Batman Begins stand higher than others, and I might say that as a stand alone film it is quite entertaining. However, it would be blasphemous to consider this even a door step in comparison with Tim Burton's masterpiece, which starred Michael Keaton in his signature role. The original, a realization of a comic legend, only received 7.4 on the IMDb scale. It confuses me how the general public thinks these days. Are they comparing Batman Begins with the other films released during the year, or are they being serious about it exceeding the original? Here is what I think about Batman Begins............It doesn't even feel like a Batman movie. It misses the point completely. And I hate the excuses of 'making a new Batman film for the new generation'. THE NEW GENERATION ALSO NEED GOOD FILMS. I agree with the casting of Christian Bale, a great actor and once a child prodigy (most memorable in Spielberg's Empire Of The Sun), however he alone could not save this film from disaster. Christopher Nolan is a respectful director, but did he really think he could create his own Batman? Or was it a cash-in opportunity?The Batmobile - every time I looked at it, it made my face grimace. I understand the director wanted a modern prototype of Batman, but this.......what a contraption. The Batman suit did it worst for me though. The new re-done Batman symbol is pathetic. It looked more like the Nazi Eagle than the original symbol that really looked like a Bat. Why does Nolan require Batman to be modernized anyway? It is the Gothic, 1950's film noir style of the original film that made Batman a household name. The whole atmosphere so vividly created by Tim Burton in the original was breathtaking and bought a comic book to life. Christopher Nolan wanted a more serious approach to Batman, for it to be more realistic. The fact Batman is wearing a Bat suit is ridiculous enough anyway, and so the fact that the director sees the legend of Batman as serious totally misses the point of THE BATMAN LEGEND. It is just a comic book, and so the unbelievable can still be believable. It doesn't have to be explained, because it is simply fiction. Like the larger than life Gotham City Tim Burton vividly bought to life and much like in the comic book itself, it is just a story that takes us to another world - and utilizes our imagination. We don't have to make Batman real. It's like explaining how Superman flies.Although the film ran for well over two hours, and felt way overlong, the characters were poorly developed. I felt, walking out of the theater, like I didn't get to know the characters. It didn't feel like they were communicating in any way to the audience. Alfred, played well by Michael Caine just didn't click with me¬Ö.nothing to do with the veteran actor. He just didn't have enough screen time or dialog for me to feel anything between him and Bruce Wayne. Also, the death of Wayne's parents in Batman Begins compared to the same death in the original, is like comparing the song ""Rain drops are fall on my head"" to ""adagio for strings"". Nolan was attempting to make a dramatic, touching scene and failed miserably. It seemed almost ridiculous ¬ñ like an episode of Bold and the Beautiful. They should have made this scene the focal point of the film, so we could feel Bruce Wayne's pain and understand his Legend. I thought 'Scarecrow' was an effective villain, and he scared the hell out of me first time he revealed himself. But he too could not have saved this film from inevitable down fall.Worst of all, fighting scenes were atrocious. Unlike the Tim Burton classic, I couldn't see what the bloody hell was going on on screen. Close-ups, over-layered by shaky cameras, over-layered by quick-cuts so as we don't see how well the actors really fight - what a joke. Sure the story is great, but we came to see Batman kick the enemies butts. Some nice CGI effects were added to the film well, but they could not assist Batman in anyway, because they literally weren't really needed. I think people have either forgotten Tim Burton's unmatched atmosphere of Batman or what makes a good film. From Beginning to End I didn't feel like I was watching a Batman movie - it felt more like a normal action blockbuster we see too much of. It missed the whole Gothic exterior that made the original film larger than life and at times scary. The actors, including Michael Caine, Rutger Hauer, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman all did great jobs, apart from a few. It was the sets designs, the suit, the Batmobile, the normal look of everything that made this just a boring entry that shouldn't even be called 'Batman'. It is definitely better than Val Kilmer and George Clooney's mediocre sequels. However for this film to get a higher score than the original is like spitting in Tim Burton's face and forgetting the greatness of how film used to be made. Let's not forget one of the most memorable movie scores of all time from the original that assisted to define THE BATMAN. I can only predict that Batman Begins, only in a few years, will be laughable."
tt7286456,"The clueless scriptwriter, director and cast are oblivious to the concept of The Joker. Clowns are the slapstick, predictable fools who do stupid things to entertain small, childlike minds. This is a story that fits nowhere and merely provides two hours of tedious boredom.
The thin plot is uninteresting, the characters are dull and the entire thing could be played out, without losing a molecule of content, within fifteen minutes.
I was annoyed that it was this bad, given the enthusiastic reviews - but I can't say I was surprised. So much poor film-making gets a rave response that that the positive reviews simply mean lots of jaded or thhughtless people liked it. That's no indication of its quality, sadly.
Oh well, another two hours of watching mediocrity mixed with boredom just so that I can appreciate a good movie when one turns up."
tt0372784,"This is certainly, without question the best Batman film ever made, although that isn't saying much. Christopher Nolan makes this into a very dark and brooding tale that tells more about Bruce Wayne than Batman, something the other movies would never have done. Nolan is a great director and he takes a great leap of faith by showing perhaps the most important screen superhero in such a way that the city of Gotham and its components don't feel like taken from a comic book, but from real life. Batman Begins is based more on graphic novels and the original characters by Bob Kane, so the realism and details are there without all the fluff and showboating Joel Schumacher would have put out. Christian Bale is perfect as the title character and he creates a more interesting Bruce Wayne than Batman only because we see more of Wayne in this installment. All other roles are perfectly cast, especially Liam Neeson as a mysterious yet intelligent and brutal member of the League of Shadows. Katie Holmes is nice and sweet as Wayne's childhood friend, and there will never be another Alfred as long as Michael Caine resides.Simply put, Batman Begins is worth the time and money. It pulls you into a world you would never expect to see in a Batman movie, than transports you to Gothan City, the rotting core of it mostly. When we do get a glimpse of Batman, it really is quite different than other interpretations. The action here is based more on suspense than violence and the plot moves along quite well to make this movie feel shorter than its 140 minute running time. So, if you are going to see The Dark Knight this weekend, be sure to check this out first. Indeed, if it is anything like this one, this franchise is going somewhere truly spectacular."
tt0114369,"'He is preaching¬Ö.punishing'.Serial killing with clues from killer is not a new thing to Hollywood but David Fincher's Se7en exceptional. Its evil genius. Se7en opens with a homicide where a fatso is killed in a very strange manner. We meet Detective Somerset(Freeman) who is about to take off and detective David Mills(Pitt) has just fought to get assigned there. Somerset is calm, mature and has achieved mastery over his job. He probably seen so much that now he badly wants to go far away from this bloodshed. David appears cocky first but turns out amiable character of the film. Tracey(Palthow) is David's wife who hasn't got used to with guns even after so many years of their marriage.It begins. Each killing is shockingly repellent. Like an artist's signature every victim holds a note, a sin highlighted with lines from Dante Alighieri' s 'Divine Comedy', Shakespeare's 'Merchant of Venice'. And his name is John Doe(Kevin Spacey). Those lines are screaming that this not just some insanity. He wants to make a point.Each murder is done by reaching horrific extremes of those deadly sins. A fat man is fed until he burst. Then there is an infamous lawyer got gun stuck on his head, handed a knife -a weighing scale is in front of him and he has to cut 1 pound of flesh from his body by himself. A druggist tied to bed for a whole year!! A famous model, her nose is cut and bandaged again and gave a choice- phone in one hand to call help n sleeping pills in other one to die rather than live deformed. A whore is punished ruthlessly that you should see on screen only. John says, ""The world is so shitty¬Öand we get used to them"".This Script is sumptuous. It mirrors today's society skillfully and boldly. Nothing is hidden by the camera. All we watch is naked truth that we hate to admit and most of the time that we hardly care. The spirituality woven in has its impact all over. Most of all ending is a blow. It is stunning.There are number of memorable sequences in Seven. One especially is breath-taking when Somerset and Mills reaches John doe's apartment and Doe directly starts shooting at them and chase sequence followed is absolute fabulous. On other hand dinner party at Mills house we feel wine mixed in the air. Tracey and Somerset's meeting at coffee shop is the finest ones I ever seen. The intensity of that conversation can't be described.This is a very dark film. It is all time raining. All environment surrounding Se7en is so grim and ghastly it clouds viewers with the same. Music refuse to leave us even when it is over. I must mention titles and credits rolled, one of the best I ever seen.Se7en comes out with strong performances. Morgan Freeman is truly outstanding. Brad Pitt made me his fan from this movie. The way he says ""Ladies and Gentleman we have a homicide here"" and same David when taunted by Somerset ""You are saying you care for these people?"" says with assuring impulse ""Sure I do¬Ö.!!!"". Gwyneth Paltrow 's Tracey doesn't have much screen presence but when she is there, we just can not stop love her character. In final half an hour we are introduced to Kevin Spacey's John Doe. The preacher. What can I say about this chilling work? Spacey gave such a performance that stings. We hate to admit with this man but somewhere we know he is right. Somerset asks him, ""So you are saying some higher power tell you to do this?"" Just watch John Doe reply ""Lord works in mysterious ways.."". Interesting thing pointed out by one of the fan is Somerset and John Doe both observed the same facts about today's society but responds in different ways, Somerset want to run away and Doe takes action.No matter how many thrillers I shall see but this will always one of my favorites. It affects deeply. That's the power of Se7en. Se7en is a terrific thriller and a modern classic."
tt0816692,"A lot has been said and heard about this movie but none of it comes even close to the experience of watching it. It has all the elements of a Nolan movie and just like in all of his other movies he decides to go a bit further. This time, he went a little too far. The story behind the movie has it's flaws. There really is no explanation of what happened/is happening. Instead you are given fragments in the first half of the movie hoping one will put all the pieces together. All in all, the first part seems a bit rushed and leaves you wondering if more could have been told. But, since the real story is not why the travel is necessary but the travel itself once the crew is off, the story really kicks in. The main part of the movie gives a great ride, pumps your blood with adrenaline from time to time and gets you emotional pretty often. The problem I personally had was that the story taking place simultaneously on Earth was less shown than I expected. A different approach was expected but that did not stop Chastain from giving the best role in the movie. The last part of the movie is dynamic and filled with problems real people would have if found in a situation like that. But the explanation given at the very end was a bit to much for me. I heard that this was called ""the most scientifically accurate movie"" and that physicist around the world fought over the fact was that true or not. Nevertheless, way too much theoretical physics in the end. Since I love SF movies I am willing to look past the over- the-top science part, but what really got to me was that it was predictable. From the very moment I saw a black hole in the movie I put two and two together and that kinda ruined it for me a little. Regarding the acting, as I said before, Chastain gave the most powerful performance in the movie. She doesn't have much screen time, but she sure knows how to use it. The two that actually lead the movie - McConaughey and Hathaway were brilliant. McConaughey did a little better job handling the emotions of a father with the responsibilities of a team leader and the savior of mankind. His performance was outstanding. Hathaway was good, decent, without a single word that can be said against her, but for a movie like this, that is almost completely on the shoulders of the actors, she should have done more. The others did a good job, particularly Casey Affleck who's character was a grand comparison to Chastain's. The music given it was done by the mastermind Hans Zimmer was spectacular. Just the right notes, just the right timing, just the right music. His understanding of what movies should sound like is amazing. All in all, Interstellar is a magnificent movie. It is a type of movie Nolan does best. It has all the elements of being a classic like Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey, it comes really close to being the new space odyssey, and it will not perish with time. Still, this might be a bit too much for the average moviegoer, a lot has to be digested here, it is not a simple or easy movie to watch. But, if your braincells don't shut off and you don't expect another Die Hard movie, you will appreciate this masterpiece."
tt1375666,"Disappointed, Oh yes I am Disappointed. Why, Because I had high expectations. Why I had High Expectations? Because Nolan's History of Film making was what I was confident about. Memento, The Dark Knight are the two Movies which got a 10/10 and 9/10 rating from me respectively. But Inception, It was neither Memento, Nor The Dark Knight. It was more of a screenplay forcing you to believe it and to make it look genuine BUT with flawed ways and formulaic techniques which didn't work for me.Other than that it was fine. Visuals, Performances, Editing were all fine and the Camera Used for the movie was not the perfect choice. Direction as usual was POWERFUL but it was the story that didn't really appealed me.It is a movie with fine content but a forcing (in a wrong way) story. 6/10. And I am not crying its over-rated since most of people have really liked it."
tt0372784,"I thought this movie was absolutely spectacular, I took me by surprise. I never thought I would see a Batman movie with depth and that showed the true fear that is the character Batman that he brings to his enemies. Christian Bale did a excellent job and I truly look forward to him in another Batman Movie!The story was absolutely amazing and in my humble opinion very original. Raj Al Ghul is an excellent villain and to portray him in the way he was portrayed was top notch, not to mention he was played very well. Many people I talked to complained that the actor who played him was not of Asian decent. However I believe it truly didn't matter at all.Not to mention Alfred was great. Gordon (later Commissioner Gordon) was excellent as well.No other Batman Movie has portrayed Batman truly as the Dark Knight and as I said already I truly look forward to more along these lines.-ND"
tt0120737,"Alright, I liked the movie, but I have mixed feelings.First of all, you gotta give Jackson credit for his work, but it seems to me, that though he did a good job over all he did not really catch the magic of the books - and I don't mean in the movies, but he himself. The special-effects, the cast and and the production are great - but for every acceptable or good change to the original story you find at least the same amount of really bad choices Jackson made. Let me just give the example of who is responsible for going through Moria in the book and on the other hand in the movie. Why change it to Frodo and give him the burden of Gandalf's death? Why do not let Aragorn take the broken sword out of Rivendell? These are just needless and bad changes to the original story, and there are more examples for that kind of things.But nevertheless the movies made a break for the fantasy-genre and will spawn a lot of movies from the same kind (or so I hope). Jackson deserves credit for that. The Lord of the Rings is something you have to see - but not something you have to like."
tt0137523,A woman needs to speak up for Helena Bonham Carter's incredible acting performance in this movie. Because it's guys who post for the film she's been overlooked because no man can relate to how anti-female this woman is and how far from the real Helena. Women who can treat random sex and despicable grunge as a natural and casual form of life have gone off the path somewhere and this girl isn't looking for redemption. She embraces the strange as normal and rejects the comfortable and pretty as the aberrations. Few other actresses could have achieved the level of intense hyperactivity and abandon Helena captures here. So much so that she sinks into the movie like a dead body into a sewer and has been ignored on these boards thus far.
tt0133093,"The Matrix defines Y2K sci-fi action. Its special effects are most notable because a combination of CGI and practical gives the film a dreamlike, yet grounded feel. Plenty of action is enhanced by effects in The Matrix, but the highlight has to be the shootout in the lobby because it is done without CGI. Painstaking work was put into actually dismantling that lobby and it paid off. Next, the production design of The Matrix builds a sleek world of green hues and leather jackets that still inspires aesthetics today. The dystopian future is appropriately bleak while the computer world is appropriately polished.Meanwhile, The Matrix has dynamic camerawork. Its use of the bullet time effect has become synonymous with the film and is even known as ""the Matrix effect"". The sound design is surreal and the music is borderline iconic. The story is philosophical and trippy. Lastly, the direction is wonderful because The Matrix has such a precise style. Its combination of eastern and western action, its slick fashion, and its futuristic visuals create an experience that cannot be replicated. Because The Matrix is jam-packed with so much excitement, flair, and abstraction, it is a generational experience.Writing: 9/10

tt0120815,"I successfully avoided this until seeing Band of Brothers, which raised my previously low interest in Spielberg productions; having seen one too many of his mawkish, sentimental pieces of malarkey. Instead, it turns out it was wise to skip this for almost a decade.A troop that has just landed at Normandy is diverted to move 100m into France and find a single private whose value has just gone up. And sure... they walk the whole way (never even hitching a ride) They encounter provisioned troops every fifteen minutes along the way (any of which would have been more efficiently tasked with the mission.) and they find Ryan not alone & lost behind enemy-lines (maintaining radio silence, or in imminent danger); but amidst another platoon (also provisioned) and ready to take on a mission against 4 German tanks and about 80 Germans. Really... what a bunch of schlock!Why do people make up stories to tell about WW2 to show their respect for those who fought it? Make up characters? Invent a phony mission that never occurred? What? ...the hundreds of thousands of personal stories that exist didn't have enough dramatic range? This is a brazen slap in the face to all who fought.S.P.R. is just so much retrograde 1950's storytelling, and Spielberg doesn't have it in him to recognize cinematic cheese when he smells it. There's so much time for soldiers pouring out their hearts & having profound discussions that it's a wonder they even had time for a war. Spielberg is only a shade subtler than flashing subtitles every now and then that say, ""CRY NOW!"" and ""WAVE THE FLAG!"" I'm as susceptible as anyone to patriotism, but come on. The 3 stars I gave it are for the battle sequences. Every time the action slows & Spielberg needs to come up with something dramatic he delivers a pile of corn... and earns a barrel of lemons. Structurally this feels like a grab-bag of scenes made for an even longer movie. They find private Ryan almost effortlessly.And what's with the all-star cast, Hanks, Giamatti, Diesel, Damon, Danson, Hines, Ribisi... I can't imagine any of these guys are WW2 figures because they're all so overexposed in the current timeframe.I didn't need this giant pile of malarkey and all it's cheap sentiment to make me feel a debt to the Allies in WW2. I have reality to do that."
tt0109830,Most overrated movie ever. Seems like it was made for republicans to j*ck off to
tt0108052,This movie leads us through a dark side of world war 2. It shows us the horrors of the Holocaust without being too shocking nor ignoring the reality. The movie's running time is quite long (over 3 hours) but still the story line and the cinematography can capture us within the movie with ease. The cinematography is original with it's choice of black/white colours with some rare colours that gives meaning in emotional scenes. A real masterwork that should be seen!

So the story starts in de first part by giving you a different view on the world we live in (which we are not aware of...interesting). After you realise this the movie just crashes. The screenwriter obviously had no idea where to go from this point on and slows the story down. There is some action which leads to nowhere. The story doesn't progress and you're just waiting for the story to start and progress. The main reason you would want to see this movie is because of the special effects and at some points a lot of action is going on but... the story isn't going anywhere which makes you feel like the movie just goes on and on and on... In the end I felt that its a shame, because a good idea got slaughtered by a bad screenwriter. I gave 2 point just for the idea."
tt0109830,"This was an interesting trip through the eyes of an idiot, as he is referred to by most in the film. I loved the music during the particular events, as well. Yes, this was an excellent film and yes, Tom Hanks is brilliant. The film is ultimately a talkie, though, and I'm not into talkies. I also found the film overlong with possibly too much information crammed into it. The visual effects were very good, especially the war scenes. The film does teach us a few lessons, e.g. never to judge a person by appearance, and never going back on promises made, and probably also not to give up on your dreams."

tt1130884,"Shutter Island had a promising premise and a good trailer, but when I left the theater I was totally annoyed - movie was worst scheisse that Scorsese has put out (saying it mildly).First thing that bugged me was the quality of film - it could have been badly focused projection of the film in the theater in question (Kinopalatsi, Helsinki) - but I noticed that some scenes had really blurry shots because director of photography chose the depth of field totally wrong. Film had some visual moments, but general blurriness of picture ruined those moments.Story was incomprehensible with it's flashbacks and twists. DiCaprio was just going around the island without any significance. Story didn't go nowhere and it was getting boring in the end.I can imagine Hollywood producers thinking that they will combine atmosphere from the 'Shining' with story similar with 'Beautiful Mind' and TV series 'Prisoner'. I think that Scorsese didn't have much to say in this - I can't believe that he would have done this voluntarily, probably did it just for money."
tt1130884,"I thought I was ready for the ending when my friends recommended 'Shutter Island' to me. I had been connecting the puzzle throughout every scene, without realizing what a mega puzzle it actually was. To sculpt such a giant plot twist was remarkable, and I would put it on my list with similar masterpieces that contain elements of surprises like 'Now You See Me', 'Fractured'.Leonardo wowed me, on how he could portray a character full of questions, only to find even a bigger question! Obviously, his acting in this very movie was the key that opened the doors to his next amazing roles such as the 'Inception', and 'Great Gatsby', because his characters have always left such an impression in his audiences."
tt0109842,"Hi all.I have seen this movie before and it didn't touch me then. Now 10 years after, much have happened in my life.Now I was touched all the way into my bones. What a movie. So real. So cruel. So a world of drugs and feelings blended to, much death and some hope. A hope so strong that nothing breaks through.Like life. A road is to be decided. You, other decide. All life will be affected by your choices. This movie contains 2 well known highways along your journey of decisions.Thanks for a great experience on my journey around.D. Severinsen"
tt0848228,"This is not a great movie. It's not even a very good one. I liked the first Avengers movie; this one greatly disappointed me.The plot and subplot--barely there.All the snappy dialog in the whole movie MAYBE equaled two minutes.Character relationships--we're supposed to believe them?? The audience wasn't born yesterday...This movie focuses on the fight scenes. Technically, they impressed me (I counted 11 visual-effects companies in the credits!). I didn't time the fight scenes, but I would guess that they take up at least 90 minutes of the movie.So if you like fight scenes, this movie is for you. For the rest of us, meh."
tt1345836,"The Dark Knight Rises is a great film and should definitely be watched. This review will have a bunch of critiques in it because... what's the point of reading a review that just compliments a movie non-stop. So remember, I really enjoyed the Dark Knight Rises... but it did have a bunch of annoying factors to it that did take away from the experience overall. I will list my issues with the movie first, then I will say what I enjoyed about the film at the end so that the review will end on a pleasant note.Something that really bothered me about this movie is that it was inconsistent at times. For example, the power of Batman's bat-copter. In one scene its rockets are extremely powerful and can easily blow up multiple cars in a single shot, but in the next scene it can't even scratch an armored truck with multiple rounds... or even burst its tires. This movie is full of small stuff like that which really bothers me. The other movies were all about making Batman... realistic and more logical. But in this movie it seems like everyone is making stupid decisions, wrong choices, and there seems to be a lack of anyone making intelligent moves except for the main villain. Though I will mention that Commissioner Gordon and his detective side-kick break that formula which was nice.First off (and this goes with all of the Batman movies): why are the cops portrayed as clich√© jerks who don't really know how to fight? This movie really portrays cops badly and that they are useless. In the movie there is an army of cops with armed guns, running against an army of thugs with machine guns, snipers, and rockets. So what do the cops do? They run out into the open in a large swarm... and use hand to hand combat... they don't use their guns to fight the hundreds of guys with machine guns and tanks... it makes no sense.The military in this movie seems to work similarly to the cops but even worse. In case you don't know, *spoilers* this movie revolves around Bane and a nuclear bomb threat. Basically he has a fusion reactor that is portable and is threatening Gotham with it. The thing that bothers me is that the military does absolutely nothing about it. While Bane does say that if anyone enters Gotham that he will set it off, there still would've been ways to take out Bane. It bothers me that the military does absolutely nothing at all to try and stop Bane. But I guess this movie isn't about the military.A small problem I mentioned earlier and I will mention again is that no one except the enemies use their guns... at all. The enemies are threatening Gotham with a nuke, are killing hundreds (if not thousands) of innocent people, and armed with machine guns and even declare they are in open war... but no one ever really uses any guns (effectively) against them. Which leads me up to Bane... Bane is really menacing and well portrayed. But people seem to forget that (like the joker) a single bullet can still kill him. The second you realize that guns actually could've stopped this entire situation... the entire plot starts to fall apart... now I'm started to sounds like I work for the NRA hahahaha so I'll stop.Minor issues: No bat-mobile... at all, Bane doesn't have a dramatic death, all guys fall for women they've met two seconds ago, if you could stop the fusion core from going off by flooding it (which is stated in the movie) then why did it go off at the end? Another question, why didn't Morgan Freeman just flood the room with the reactor which would've killed all of the bad guys and would've disabled the nuke. That would've saved so many lives and the movie would've been a good hour shorter.Now that I'm done listing the minor faults of the movie, here are the good stuff! First off, the movie has a lot of nice standard special effects. Standard special effects always look nicer and keep movies from aging. Though the CGI in this movie... it already looks aged. Bane is a good menace in this movie and is very well acted. He looks very powerful and intimidating in appearance, but the movie didn't put much emphasis on the fact that his mask is what makes him powerful. The movie never really says that his mask is the key to his power but oh well.The acting is really good in this movie and it seems slightly odd that pretty much everyone is a little bit more interesting than Bruce Wayne. I'm not saying that Christian Bale didn't do a great job of acting, but all of the other characters were a bit more intriguing in my opinion.The plot is pretty good, there are a few plot holes here and there but that's not too important. I guess I was kind of curious why every single person that is in jail seems to be evil and a murderer. I find it odd that it seems like all of the gang lords and murderers want Gotham to be in chaos because most people don't actually want chaos.The ending was good, but it begs for a sequel sooooooo much! Which is kind of annoying since there won't be a sequel. But at least it ended on a good note that was actually happy. Good movie! Not perfect, but still good!"
tt0120815,"For people who say this is the best war movie, I can't help but wonder if any of those people have some of Stanley Kubrick's war films. Dr. Strangelove and The Paths of Glory IMO are so much better than Saving Private Ryan. Saving Private Ryan visually and technically is far superior to the other films. But the story isn't a gripping story which feels like it has an very powerful message. Largely because it's centered around WW2 which was a war which was necessary for the allies to fight in. The more compelling films IMO are the ones centered around wars and encounters which represent the costs of wars for little if any benefit. I'd say that Warhorse is a better film than Saving Private Ryan too.Saving Private Ryan does display the real bravery and horrors of WW2. But that is nothing particularly new. Just about every WW2 film does that. The main story-line of rescuing Ryan is what is the biggest turnoff to me. The film even addresses the issue of their order to rescue Ryan. It's not smart to put an entire team of many people in danger in order to try to rescue one soldier in the middle of a battlefield. Many other soldiers die, and Ryan, even when found doesn't feel he deserves to be rescued. He even insists that they keep fight off their enemy rather than leave right away. My inquiry is that if our Nation objects to too many family members dying in battle, why allow so many of one family to fight? Probably my favorite parts of the film were the side stories not directly related to Saving Ryan at all. I like the story of the translator going from a coward to a killer. I like the part of the film where they discuss whether it's right or wrong to escape a Nazi Trap or put themselves and their mission at risk in order to spring the trap. And of course the D-day invasion sequence is incredibly powerful.The film is certainly worth watching, and many people it's great, but I just find it OK, and certainly not one of the best War films. I don't know if it would even crack my top 10."

tt0109830,"Robert Zemeckis directed this movie, Forrest Gump, in 1994. It well maintained the theme from the original version of book, ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" and ""Stupid is as stupid does"" This movie contains a lot of great actors and actresses who could act their own characters very well and showed the theme or plot. The reason why this film became so popular is because this story isn't just for the certain period or certain people, but for everyone.The movie begins in the small fictional town in Alabama but soon; the setting of this movie goes on to the whole world. The setting also proves about the universal theme, ""Everyman"" All the important events happen between late 1950s to late1980s. This movie doesn't only affects about late 1950s to late1980s but the present time also. Such as white trash and people who have physical problems didn't live only between 1950s to 1980s but they still exist.There are several characters that strongly affect the theme or the plot of this movie. First of all, the surrealistic character, Forrest Gump who was acted by Tom Hanks well represented the theme and also well showed of physical problem of Forrest. His IQ was under 70 and he had a problem with his legs when he was young. When he became an adult, he was still prejudged by people based on his intelligence. However, later he becomes really famous and rich. This event doesn't really mean to show that Forrest Gump became a successful person, but the movie is trying to break a strong stereotype of people, by using Forrest Gump. Also, it is telling not to judge people's ability or characteristics by intelligence or physical abilities. Like his quote ""stupid is as stupid does."" Mrs. Gump, Sally Fields, the actress was actor playing the mother of Forrest shows the theme of strong determination of all mothers in the world. Even though only ten year older than the grown Forrest Gump, her acting was so realistic that the audience didn't realize her age. Jenny, who was acted by Robin Wright, showed the reality of dark side of Americans' life. In the movie Jenny was the ""white trash"" but she isn't the only who is showing the theme of American life but partly, but through L.T he is somehow showing it too. He's character was so realistic. A deep friendship is expressed through his characterization.Generally, there are six most interesting events that are happening in this movie. In my opinion, starting the movie by grown Forrest Gump talking about his childhood from the present time on the bench is a good idea. His first interesting event starts when he entered school. He had a hard time. On the school bus everyone seemed to avoid him or be as far away from him, only because of his physical appearance. But later, Jenny who didn't look about her appearance came to him and be friend. Other than this, there are three events that Forrest Gump becoming all famous and meeting the U.S president three times. With this event, the plot goes really high in audience interest and I'm sure that viewers loved these events. Lastly, there is one important event left, about Jenny and Forrest that went audience very pleased but not a real happy ending.I was very impressed with this movie, especially with the acting skills and the themes of this story. This is a film that everyone would like and feel empathy with all these characters. The plot also appeals to average and ordinary people. I recommend this movie to all people no matter how old they are."
tt0137523,"The last time that I watched Fight Club was probably 15 or so years ago. I've seen it probably 2 or 3 times up until then. I remember in my youth/young adulthood I just remember loving the movie. I would have gave it a 9-10 all day. Now that I'm older I realize I may have been overrating it a bit. Yes, the movie is good with solid acting, good plot, and great shots. However, it is just missing something for me now. I'm not sure what it is. Maybe it is the last 30 minutes or so. The ending just felt rushed to me when certain things are starting to make sense for the main character."
tt0287336,"While fans of Goodfellas might tune into this schlock on Cable TV thinking there would be more about the 1978 Lufthansa heist that was so important in that film, they will be sadly disappointed. Jimmy Burke was not a ""small-time hood"", he was simply not Italian and could never be ""made"" (neither could Henry Hill) so was merely ""associated"" with the Mafia. While the real names of the participants are used as opposed to Goodfellas (Burke instead of Conway etc.) this movie is just too distorted from the true story. Donald Sutherland gives a fine performance in a lame effort but why the Irish accent? How did Burke's son enter into the caper?"
tt0468569,"Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend, the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so... this film is a step-above the standard summer blockbuster. However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from clich√©, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good."
tt0559179,"Travis Tritt guest stars as Kurt Fallon, who literally has a death wish when he wants Steve to put him out of his literal misery. This episode, Down Among the Dead Men raises important issues about insurance liability and the literal meaning of life and the alternatives to it.Anyway Travis Tritt maintains his country and western accent for this episode but I would have liked to see his acting range give him the opportunity to have a Southern Californian or a New York accent which could have garnered him an Emmy Award. I like Diagnosis Murder and this episode dealt with the meaning of life and insurance companies."
tt0120737,"Now, keep in mine that I have read the Lord of the Rings series and enjoyed it. Moving on. This is the most angry I've ever felt leaving a movie since after I saw Boys and Girls, and this film was likely a more egregious mistake. This is yet another example of Hollywood doing a ham-fisted job of adapting a book to film. I shutter to call this a film. The book was unmercifully butchered to the point where it became a vapid, predictable story that turned out to be the most curt three hour movie I've ever witnessed. Some have argued that the adaptation of the novel calls for certain things to be cut out, but many of these cuts are inexcusable(notably the background of Strider and the army that travels with the fellowship, and I myself am being curt with this list). Even those of you who plan on seeing this movie for it's eye-candy, I suggest to you to take notice that the eye-candy can not excuse what has happened here. This movie has not allowed itself eye-candy status, like The Mummy 2 and alike, because its supposed allure is in its story. Now to be fair this was not a horrid film, most likely somewhere between a four and a six on a scale of ten, but I rated this film a one in attempt to bring it down from its lofty perch that I can only assume it was given by those, like myself, that were so eager to see a movie of one of their favorite books. I beseech all of you that have seen this movie and read the book(or those that have read the book and not seen the movie) that have given the film a ten to reevaluate your rating and think of this as an actual movie not your favorite book set to moving pictures(and those who have not seen the film to see it before just going on how good the book is). This movie may not be the worst Hollywood has churned out, but it does not touch such movies as The Godfather 1 or 2, Shawshank Redemption, Citizen Kane, Schindler's List, Star Wars, or even, as far as I'm concerned, Tron. Please in the name of all that is right and fair in the cinematic world, bring this movie's rating down to its rightful level, down with its mediocre, or a little above that, brethren. Do not taint the reputation of the world's greatest cinema just for your favorite book. Go rent the other films on the IMDB top 10 or 20, and I dare you to tell me that I am wrong."
tt1130884,"I have to comment on this film since I was so disappointed in it. When I read the review this morning in the paper, I was sure I was going to skip it (the critic in the Washington Post panned it). However, later in the day I noticed on IMDb that it had a rating of 8.5, the same as Avatar, so I began to wonder if it might be good. I went to Metacritic and found it had a generally favorable score of 63, so I decided to see it. I could have gone to see Valentine's Day, which my friend had described as not as bad as he thought it would be.Close to two slow hours are spent in developing the story that had a very convoluted and unsatisfying conclusion. There was very little entertainment value in this movie, although the acting was generally good. The critic in the Post called the movie weird and I would have to agree. I would say that, if the story was better and the conclusion more satisfying, my rating would have been higher, although I would still not recommend this movie."
tt0372784,"It's reaching a point at which I no longer have any idea of what to make of these comic-book derived superhero movies. The budget must have been lavish. You ought to see Gotham. The glass boxes of yesteryear have become a little more baroque, so that Batman can swing from cartouche to Churrigueresque spatial decoration. Actually, he does do a lot of swinging, as well as zipping up and down, but he doesn't have to. He can leap from the top of a skyscraper and flutter his way elsewhere like a flying squirrel. Somewhere in the silent film archives is a short shot of a man jumping from a platform wearing a pair of wings strapped to his arms. He falls immediately to earth. Batman doesn't. He just make a loud fluttering noise, as of a bat. He also has a lot of gadget and an armor suit and what-not -- not including a gun -- that makes it possible for him to do impossible things.Where did he learn his principles, after his mother and father were killed by a poor person in the bifurcated society of the future? And where did he pick up his mano-a-mano combat skills? And where did he find all those gadgets that make James Bond look like a tyro? Christian Bale got them from a host of first-rate supporting players, including Liam Neeson as his faux guru, Morgan Freeman as the custodian of armor and weapons too expensive to sell to the army, Gary Oldman as one of the few upright police officers in Gotham, and Michael Caine as the ever-helpful Alfred. Every one of them is splendid. Even the villainous parts -- Rutger Hauer, for instance -- are neatly delivered, and Cillian Murphy, as the psychiatrist who has developed a hallucinogenic substance to poison Gotham's water supply, is superbly prissy and haughty. Tom Wilkinson is fine too, as Carmine Falcone, one of the honchos who will bring the city to its delirious knees. I thought I saw John Hurt in the cast, but no -- a dead ringer. Katie Holmes is very nice to look at, with her cherubic face, but she isn't given much to do.There is some mumbo jumbo about ""finding your inner self"" and all that. ""In order to conquer fear you must become fear,"" intones Liam Neeson somewhere in Tibet. But the acting and the Philosophy for Dummies are all distractions for the real star of the movie -- the special effects. They've turned the Batmobile into what one cop describes hesitantly as ""a tank."" The visual effects are overwhelming. They are to the rest of the movie what a wrecking ball is to the abandoned tenement it destroys.If you like special effects, especially those that reveal a city on which the sun never shines, although the rainfall is copious, this is your movie. You'll just have to sit through a little thoughtful advice on how to come to terms with your anger -- and you don't get the girl at the end, either."
tt0848228,"Being at one time a young ten year old kid who cut his teeth on 'COWBOY SAM' books and 'JOHN HENRY AND THE DOUBLE-JOINTED STEAM DRILL' as well 'UNCLE ARTHUR'S BEDTIME STORIES', the adventures of the MARVEL UNIVERSE were a welcome introduction into what the older kids were reading and doing. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby somehow as though by divine guidance properly gauged the angst of those teenage years in the Sixties and the zeitgeist of that era. Before the Avengers battled the Space Phantom, I cannot remember when I ever encountered a Superhero like the Hulk. Basically he was a bully in diapers who did not play well with others. After the Avengers at last sent the Space Phantom back into limbo where he belonged, the Hulk related that his feelings were hurt by the remarks others made about him during the heat of battle. He gave the Avengers his walking papers and jumped off into parts unknown.This never would have happened in the JUSTICE LEAGUE.During the showing I attended, after the credits were done, there is a scene where the Avengers are sitting together in a restaurant eating. The expressions on their faces indicate that they would all rather be somewhere else. When I first saw it, it appeared a little non-sequitur and just something added-on to pique interest. But then I went to my Volume 1 of the ESSENTIAL AVENGERS which covers the first twenty four issues of their saga. I decided to use it as a reference for my remarks in this review. When I got to page two of Issue Two, there it was right at the bottom! Essentially the same scene that tagged the end of the Avengers movie. Oh, the setting was different as well as a couple of the characters present or absent, but the theme of the scene was identical to the movie. A bunch of misfits decide to get together and meet regularly in order to increase and better facilitate group cohesion and they can barely stand being in each other's presence! It's the American Experience reductio ad absurdum. It is also the Human Experience should you wish to wax philosophical about it.Reminds me of something I once heard Jesse Jackson declare during a speech and I believe he was quoting Martin Luther King; ""We have to learn to live together no matter how painful, or we'll die apart as fools.""Suffice it to say that for the Avengers working together and living together is particularly painful at times.No, Robert Downey Jr. would not have ordinarily come to mind as Tony Stark AKA IRON MAN, with his yuppie insouciance, but this is a new generation with its own issues and tastes, so there's no use asking ""-where have you gone Errol Flynn and Ronald Coleman?"". They're probably having lunch with Joe DiMaggio. Downey, in his own way, does more than represent with IRON MAN.Knowing this genre intimately and well, this time I may be too close to it to effectively evaluate it. There are all kinds of things in this movie that do not fit, but that's the glory of the Marvel Universe. It is a depot for all the things that do not fit that are somehow made to achieve this transcendent irreverent harmony, rhythm and balance. As Edward G. Robinson once said in THE CINCINNATI KID, ""-sort of like Life-"".Samuel L. Jackson has no real business being in the AVENGERS doing his usual scenery chewing, channeling bits of 'SHAFT' and 'HAWK' and the Black Man's angst about wanting in on the American Dream. For one thing, the original Nick Fury was a white World War Two hero who headed a squad called Sgt. Fury's Howling Commandos. He would probably be in his nineties by now, but only a time chosen few would know that. Besides, that's the beauty of this fantasy scenario. Nobody really questions what or who these super-powered characters are supposed to be avenging. Actually they're more like the FINAL GUARDIANS than AVENGERS. Anyway, you really would be missing the point pursuing this line of questioning. Here are all these odds and ends of personality and death-defying events and cultural themes somehow welded and soldered together in a kind of collage of imagination and experience and juvenile science fiction and it all works because in the end this ain't your universe. It's the MARVEL UNIVERSE and you're just living and thrilling in it. When you look at it that way, Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury gets down and gets back, and redefines the American Dream as something more than that house with the little white picket fence and perhaps simply the divine right to be whatever you want to be.Joss Whedon and Zak Penn finally wised up and decided to stand on the shoulders of giants Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, instead of jumping off to do their own thing with the Marvel Universe. They have written a tale to celebrate. Joss Whedon's direction is Marvelouseque rather than a penetrating interpretation that sometimes hits and sometimes misses as in the case with Sam Rami's SPIDERMAN movies.Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, Tom Huddleston as Loki, Scarlet Johansson as the Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, all have sufficient back stories now either through prior movies or the comics for the audience to be thoroughly prepared for what they might do. They are all so very nearly the characters themselves that all that's left is to be swept up in the action that is truly our satisfaction. And yet, the thing that makes the greatest impact in the end is the characters themselves.Welcome to the Marvel Age of Comics in Cinema!"

I wasnt really over touched by this series but i know it has alot of fans!! See ya folks!!!"
tt1853728,"Looks like Tarantino is getting old and jaded. He generally has a small acting role in his movies, in this one he looked like Elvis in the latter part of his career and so does the movie. Going through the motions with little emotional involvement or imagination. I am actually quite a fan of Tarantino and had hoped to see his equivalent of Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven but left the theater disappointed. The movie was far too long for what was on offer (not that much) and the ending seemed to be a 20 minute add on to meet blood and gore quotas and nothing more. As regards acting, this movie should leave a few of the famous thinking like Silvester Stallone after he made Rhinestone. I understand he basically paid to have that movie taken out of circulation. Samuel Jackson, in particular, may soon be doing the same. His role was far from sympathetic, but made worse by overacting. Don't give up the day job Quentin."
tt1345836,"A mediocre comic book film. While decent at times, there are too many patches of poor dialog the bring out poor performances from the actors. While Bruce Wayne is reluctant to put back on the bat suit, Bale seems equally reluctant to put on his Bruce Wayne suit. His performance is entirely uninteresting and he never seems to recover any fire.Hathaway does a fair job, but she and Bale lack chemistry. A scene with Levitt is so poorly written and performed it is painful to watch.Bane is never menacing. It sounds like he is impersonating Jeremy Irons from Die Hard 3. He also does this ridiculous head shake during his speech, as if to insure the audience that he is speaking.The tie in to A Tale of Two Cities is obvious and ham fisted.¬† There is so little build up to the behavior the citizens quickly adopt that ¬†it just fails to make itself plausible. While the personal sacrifice from A Tale of Two Cities makes that story powerful, the cop out in this film weakens the whole story.Some of the action scenes are pretty good. Some are just ridiculous. Batman always seems like some guy in a suit who is fighting a creepy guy with a mask.Overall this movie just fails to ever become compelling."
tt0468569,"And thus it has been watched; one of the most talked about movies of latter years. The crowning achievement of Nolas career and the apex of Heath ledgers movie history. So is it worth the praise? Does it live up to the expectations set? In short, no. In long: Noooooooooooooooo. The Dark Knight should, at heart, be about Batman and his eternal nemesis the Joker. But Nolans uneven film-making assures this is not the case; The movie has more subplots than three full seasons of ""Days of our Lives""; and most of the subplots feels as relevant as that show. To put it simply: This movie tried to put too much into too short a time. To move on to more specific details: The story has enough plot holes to sink Titanic; How does the Joker finance his operations when he seems unwilling to use cash? How does he get an army of loons to work as a cohesive and highly fanatical religious unit? How does he smuggle vast amounts of explosives onto two boats and one hospital? Another weak point is bad acting and just stupid plot movement; Bale is excellent as Bruce Wayne, he is however horrible as Batman. His completely hilarious attempt at distorting his voice sounds like a severe case of throat cancer. It is of little consequence however as he's delegated to the role of sidekick anyway. The actor who played Harvey Dent is in the long run pointless; He is of TV-quality and can't handle his role .Then again, he does it better than Tommy Lee Jones did. Gary Oldman has something of a broken look over him; he seems to wish out of the movie as soon as possible. Michael Caine as Alfred isn't that good compared to the old Alfred, but he suffices. Morgan Freeman does what he does best; Speaks with an authoritative voice.And now..To the name of the movie: Heath Ledger, who's untimely death has elevated him to the sort of cult status only death celebrities gets. WHich is unfortunate for while he was a good actor his role here is NOT that good. His version of the Joker is decent, but looses itself in some sort of misguided attempt at realism. In the end the only thing it manages to come across as is boring. The Joker is realistic, and yet gifted with overwhelming superpowers which allows him to do pretty much everything he sets his mind too. And I mean anything; Build up a criminal empire strictly on IOU notes? Check. Smuggle several tons of explosives into what one can be assumed is heavily guarded ferries? Check. Do the same to a major hospital? Check. Convince the man who's wife to be he just murdered brutally that he isn't responsible because he's just ""A dog""? Check. Damnit, this guy could probably convince Batman that he really does have feelings for Robin.Overall TDK is a uneven movie: It is hampered by poor acting, lousy effects and a horrible script. But it has some bright spots in mood and overall theme. In the end, it isn't enough and I cannot for the life of me understand why this movies is hailed as the second coming of Christ."
tt0139414,"Right, well I must admit that I had entirely forgotten about the storyline in the 1999 creature feature ""Lake Placid"". Sure, I knew it was a crocodile movie, but as to the actual story in the movie, fully forgotten. I had even totally forgotten who was in the movie.So as I had the opportunity to sit down and watch the ""Lake Placid"" movies here in 2023, I opted to do so, and of course starting with the first movie.The storyline in ""Lake Placid"", as written by David E. Kelley, is an enjoyable storyline and script. Sure, it was a pretty straightforward, if not actually a generic type of creature feature. But director Steve Miner did manage to deliver something wholesome and entertaining with ""Lake Placid"", so it worked out quite nicely. And I will say that, despite it being somewhat generic, then I was definitely entertained throughout the course of the 82 minutes that the movie ran for.The acting performances in ""Lake Placid"" were good, and I had fully forgotten that the cast ensemble in the movie was actually a rather good one. The movie was carried nicely by the performances of Bridget Fonda, Bill Pullman, Oliver Platt, Mariska Hargitay and Brendan Gleeson. And of course it was a pleasure to see Betty White in the movie as well, because she did bring something very enjoyable to the movie.Visually then ""Lake Placid"" was and is quite good. The crocodile really looks realistic and threatening. So Stan Winston really worked his magic in this 1999 movie.If you haven't already seen ""Lake Placid"", and get the chance to do so, and if you enjoy creature features, then you certainly should take 82 minutes to watch this movie.My rating of ""Lake Placid"" lands on a six out of ten stars."
tt0172495,"This must be the most overrated film of the last 30 years. I have sat through the idolisation of David Finscher, the rise of Michael Bay, and ""The Matrix"" becoming the philosopher-film of my generation, but I draw the line in the blood-soaked sand at the attention given to this movie. Three hours long when it should have been 90 minutes, the film has little to go for it apart from Russell Crowe's glower and a wash of grainy CGI effects. I will never understand how Joaquin Phoenix, who is a descent actor (Just watch ""To Die For"") managed to get an Oscar nomination for aping Malcom McDowell's performance in ""Caligula."" Am I really supposed to feel touched when Maximus returns to see his family dead; a scene from countless better films? If that is enough to move the hearts of people these days, than for God's sake send me back to the silent era.Rent Spartacus instead"
tt0167261,Battle scenes make 90% of the movie. More than enough to walk out... Even the more interesting characters become boring in such a context. What a disappointment !
tt0167261,"I guess most people take the Lord of the Rings trilogy very serious.  I see this as just a good film.  The acting is fair, and the CGI is some of the best.  There is a lot of walking around and talking in The Two Towers, and it's tough for a three hour movie to still be compelling.  The battle scene in the last hour is very well done.  6/10 Good"
tt0372784,"The action scenes in this movie looked absolutely horrible. There's no way to know what's happening most time... and I knew Batman would win before I entered the cinema, so if there's an action scene I want to see what happens! For a superhero movie this is a capital crime (can you imagine a superhero movie without any fight? This wouldn't suit the genre!) I also found quite annoying the scene with the Batmobile... man, it seems they want to sell you one! They tried to tell us how cool the Batbmobile was all time, and the scene turned out to be pathetic.The starting scenes became boring by the eleventh time Neeson talked about his pseudo-philosophical view on fear. A pity, since this could have been good if it was just a bit shorter.As for redeeming qualities, I was upset to notice there were none! Not the acting, which wasn't so bad (except for Holmes annoying character, though perhaps it was written like that), but didn't help to save the movie. The dialogs were also just OK, except when they tried to sell us their rants on vengeance/justice/fear and the like -they were such a bore...If you aren't a hardcore Batman fan, save your money. And if you are, perhaps you will notice more irritating matters which I couldn't spot, so..."
tt0172495,"GLADIATOR is a masterpiece of polished pulp Cinema with all the right ingredients: visceral fights and battles; a beautiful, mysterious woman; a villain you love to hate and a hero with a code of honor (and arms like tree trunks); it has all the drama and heartbreaking betrayals and tragic deaths of a Telenovela and as much blood and testosterone as you'd find in a Rambo movie. It's simply glorious, spectacularly entertaining filmmaking - all delivered straight to the gut and without a shred of irony.And boy is this violent revenge tale and journey to ancient Rome beautiful to look at: every shot is framed like a painting; it's one of those gorgeous looking Ridley Scott films where every landscape becomes as much a protagonist of the film as the actors in it. As for those actors, they are never less than magnetic to watch, and especially Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe stand out; they bring an intensity and all-in approach to their roles that garnered them both Oscar nominations (Crowe won his).I sometimes hear the argument by certain self-professed film critics that GLADIATOR is too pulpy to really be considered a good film. I couldn't agree less. This is one rousing adventure and one beautiful movie with a fantastic cast - and it knows exactly what it wants, and it achieves it to a degree of perfection. It's about as cinematic an experience as film can offer, and it's as watchable today as it was nearly 20 years ago.P.S.

tt1853728,"Science fiction writer Frank Herbert wrote in his novel Chapterhouse Dune: ""...the inevitable failure of slavery and peonage. You created a reservoir of hate. Implacable enemies, you dared not try. Temper your efforts by the sure awareness that oppression will make your enemies strong. The oppressed will have their day and heaven help the oppressor when that day comes. It was a two-edged blade. The oppressed always learn from and copied the oppressor. When the tables were turned, the stage was set for another round of revenge and violence--roles reversed. And reversed and reversed ad nauseam."" This film is clearly an attempt to instill the desire for modern day blacks to hate and oppress any who disagree with their liberal doctrine who are willing to submit to everything the left insists upon. This is precisely the kind of oppression we have so often seen in dictators such as Adolph Hitler.With that in mind, Django is one of the most blatant attacks the left has made on conservatives that I've seen as it works to establish a tie between the ghastly world of slavery with modern day conservatives. That was certainly the message being presented at different points in the film. It should make it very clear that what the left wants is not equality but complete and complete and utter dominion.Though acts of violence were portrayed on both sides, including the brutal killing's of slaves and other brutality, there were other scenes in which even an unarmed white woman was gunned down simply because her brother (Leonard DiCaprio) was a villainous slave owner. Several black movie goers sitting near me giggled and laughed when she was gunned down. I found this extremely disturbing that a film would encourage this type of behavior and result in such joy from blacks in attendance.I'll stick to film work such as Alex Haley's Roots, A Time to Kill, To Kill a Mockingbird, In the Heat of the Night and other great works such as these which encourage an end to oppression and not the reversal of it. Nor do any of these encourage hatred and violence by one group on another."
tt1853728,"Jesus, where to begin. Completely juvenile, rabbit trails galore, slow moving, get to the firkin point. The way the scenes drag and the endless explaining and talking. This movie was so distasteful, predictable and irritating. First of all, Foxx was miscast, he does not do period well, at all, totally unbelievable here, after years of slavery he's suddenly the fastes gun in the west, PLEASE!The music, what are we to make of the modern day music with the period events here, you can't take any of it seriously. I had to laugh was so absolutely silly and out of place. I have lost all respect for writer/director, the actors I can only hope were in it for the money, but they lose my vote now too.Open your EYES folks, for god sakes this is all about bringing division, ""I wanna shoot white people and get paid for it"". WOW, talk about the globalist elite wanting to distract and divide, this is one of their vehicles. Good for you Hollywood and Washington DC, add another notch to your ugly crown."
tt0167261,"I may not be a movie maker, or writer, or even a Phd in Tolkien World. Nevertheless, I am a great fan of him and of his books. I saw many commentaries around said that the issues on the movie are because of the difficult to make a book translation to the movies.It seems to me people are trying to refuse their own disappointments with the movie with this argument. The movements in the timeline of the movie are the first clich√©, much like episode I and dozens of other movies. Lets make a quick comparison, episode I and Two Towers have three stories running at the same time: Frodo and Sam going to Mordor, Anakim Skywalker in a space battle, Gungans going to war in the fields, Merry and Pippin and treebeard, Obi-wan Kenobi and Qui-gon Jin against Darth Maul, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in Helms Deep. 1) Chances are against the characters (Ok...we need drama) 2-TT) Frodo is captured by Faramir at the same time that treebeard and the ents decide to do nothing, at the same time the fortress begins to fall. 2-EPI) Anakin is lost inside the Trade Federation Ship, at the same time Amidala and hers guard are captured by the Vice Roy at the same Time Qui-Gon dies. 3-TT)The new hope appears with Eomer coming to help Helm¬¥s Deep, at the same time treebeard discovers that fangorn is being destroyed (how could he not know that already remains a mistery) and calls the other ents to destroy Isengard at the same time Faramir set Frodo free. I have only looked to this small part of the movie, but there¬¥s more to tell about the whole of it, I will just tell about some more clich√©s: 1) The father that does not want his daughter to marry 2) The hero that everyone know is a main character falls in battle (and everyone knows that he will return - it adds no Drama) 3) The hero that does not want the power that is his. 4) The king that does not listen to counsel. 5) The calm heroes that doesn¬¥t want to enter the war, although all evidencies seems that they had no choice. 6) The useless character that has a great idea (Pippin).There¬¥s many more that I will not put here now. In my opinion, Tolkien¬¥s world is greater than this and much more interesting."
tt0361748,"I've always been a big fan of Tarantino films, and this was certainly a good addition to his line-up of entertaining films, even though it wasn't his best.The overall plot, in my opinion, wasn't the strongest. It didn't feel like it was well drawn up and instead felt quite disorganised, in particular, I didn't feel as if the Basterds fitted in well with the rest of the plot. Their role in the movie felt rather forced, and the scenes with the Basterds were, in my opinion, the weakest scenes in the movie.Yet, while the plot wasn't really rich, the film made up for it with its tense, memorable scenes and memorable performances. As expected with Tarantino, he builds up the tension with lengthy scenes and long periods of dialogue. Oh, and of course the comedic over-the-top violence that Tarantino is renowned for does occur in this movie don't worry, but at no point was it out of place.But really, what made the film was the acting from Christoph Waltz. Before this film, Waltz was a relatively unknown actor hailing from Vienna, yet afterwards, he was transformed into a mainstream actor who all of the film directors are chasing after, and after watching Inglourious Basterds, you can see why. Waltz played the part of SS Colonel Landa to perfection. Honestly the character is one of the best villains ever in cinema history in my opinion. It was just the sheer competence, elegance and ruthlessness the man possessed made him absolutely compelling. Tarantino himself had fears that the role simply could not be played, yet Waltz completely smashed his fear, with style.As for the rest of the acting, I have to give good mention to Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger, and overall the general acting performances were solid, although, I am critical of Brad Pitt. I felt, especially as one of the main characters, he didn't really create any connection with the viewer, and the role was relatively pedestrian and simple, so this shouldn't be a film that Pitt is renowned for.Overall though, whilst the film wasn't Tarantino's best, it's certainly a film that was very entertaining and kept my interest the whole way through, so it's certainly worth watching, especially to witness the incredible acting from Waltz. I'd give the movie 8.3/10, which is what it currently is rated at."
tt0167260,"This was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is in the running for the cheesiest film ever made.  A film is cheesey when the characters get all sappy and the audience isn't sucked-in due to poor character development or unbelievable circumstances.  Its my opinion that the filmmakers here depended on the audience having read the book to learn to connect with the characters, because as someone who didn't read the book, I didn't care about any of the characters, many of whom were introduced and disappeared again without really advancing the story. This film ended at least 30 minutes before the credits ran, it just seemed like Peter Jackson wanted to construct this grandiose conclusion to the epic that would please all the die-hard tolkien fans.  Save it for the two-dozen-DVD collector's edition set! This movie is crap. I want the 7 hours I gave to this trilogy back!"
tt0102926,"A cross between Detective comics, X-files, and an episode of CSI, it's a movie. 2022 Take.Roll: FBI promotional video. (FBI money?) (ICYU win)
Clarice Starling running from the title card, alone in the woods. Why is she training alone? Cooties!She ""is"" just that hardcore people.Called in, her special ""assignment"" is a doozy to drop on a student. Even though she is top of the class with all of the psychologists and pro-filer's in the world why not a mid 20's 30's student instead. Especially with it being such a sensitive case and subject matter. So trying to bait him. Wait... doesn't that makes it even worse...
Is that even legal? Is she getting paid? Is she even an agent? Where is Keanu?So, this IS actually Harly Quinn's origin story, right?Whatever, lets send her to a dangerous psychopathic serial killer for her senior capstone.. Oh, yeah and by herself as well, no FBI partners system yet. But she asks nicely at the asylum so they just do whatever she suggests. Makes sense. Hannibal Lector at this Arkham like prison, don't get why people say he is a gentleman or likable? He is a total jerk to her from the first second they meet and is constantly trying pathetically apparent to everybody to intimidate and creep her out. She was warned to keep a distance and to not revel personal stuff to him, who the heck is watching her to ensure safety...She doesn't follow any of the rules, and nobody intervenes, maybe do that again later during this run time.. What a top of the class smarty.Not only that but Hannibal has attacked visitors before and kills a fellow inmate later on, what kind of lame operation is this where they choose to put a dangerous re-offending criminal next to a bunch of other mentally vulnerable criminals. Well they all scream on que when she leaves, but don't make a peep when Hannibal meets with her hmmm..Hannibal acting class is like: okay, now be as creepy as you possibly can, and make sure to stare more. It's somewhat laughable on a number of lines, but mostly works out I guess.Well Clarice decides to take on a top priority case as a student (is it legal?), by herself so it seems because you barely ever see anyone else working with her. And she goes off by herself to dangerous situations without a partner, like most thrillers cliches for the majority of the running time.Cops stand around and stare at Clarice... sure, maybe it's because she is FBI, why is she there in the first place? As a agent or student? Why is she all by herself? It's all there to force a awkward situation on gender roles in male dominated work spaces? Whaa, yeah the police force in a small town during the 1980's is male dominated, of course it is, why is she there as the FBI student... I don't buy that they all stand around a stare, most people would be doing something, and talk or want help in a investigation.Oh well, let's look in on a grieving family instead.""You do know the rules ma'am?""
Now they make deals with Hannibal, and he gets his way, take me to the senator! Some how he gets a pen and escapes in the most stupid police situation, it's like Andy Griffith and Barney are on duty here! Only weapon is his teeth. And fakes a cop even though he is shorter!""Clarice""(Why did he say that?)
I see the FBI is actually dumb, Good thing Clarice is on the case... Which house is it? FBI raid or Clarice's rando interview referral place... hmm.. Clarice is tough she should go alone into a strangers home smart idea. Why doesn't he fire in the dark? Well some pew pew's later and she is safe again. So relieved. OH snap a phone call at graduation. How nice.Xfiles plot lines end this way a lot too.Anyways, saw this one on many ""top"" lists. First time view 2022."
tt0361748,"8.5 points rating (26.11.2009)? For what are these points? What do people like on this sh**? Usually Tarantino makes not too bad movies with ridiculous violence scenes - but now? The whole movie looks like a dumb army propaganda video.Every normal human should see, that the actions of the ""heroes"" are in no way better then those of the ""enemies"". Killing unarmed kneeing people with baseball bat's is tough? The Nazi sign on the head is nothing else as the Yellow star (even worse cause its not removable). The story is simple, also the characters - only a little thrill and the rest is very very dumb. Nazis killing is fun,Nazis are no humans - before 60 years it was the same, only with Jews instead of Nazis. Looks like you've learned exactly NOTHING! So who are the real Nazis in this movie? So many people like this crap, i'm really afraid!"
tt0133093,"I don't get why people fawn over this movie so much. It's ideas are not actually original at all, as they have all been regurgitated from many of the great Sci- Fi stories of the twentieth century. It's not like it is the first film to get viewers to question reality. What about Dark city? That film came out a year before this one did, and does way more with its plot. In fact, I suspect that Dark city was an experiment to gauge audience interest, and The Matrix creative team decided that adding guns and action will bring a bigger audience. The story is intriguing, but in the end it actually goes nowhere. It's another Jesus allegory- only this time it has bullet time and sci-fi tropes thrown in. Seriously, how long is Hollywood going to rely on the Jesus allegory to rake in cash? Probably forever. The action scenes, while revolutionary at release, are dated - mostly because there have been about a million imitators, and about one thousand of those imitators were able to improve upon it because of the technology afforded to them. The movie is still entertaining,but, contrary to what its fans say, it is definitely a turn your brain off at the door type of movie. It's the type of movie where every plot hole and inconsistency can be excused with: doesn't matter- computer simulation. Which is fine, but it is literally the only excuse this movie has when something does not add up. There is no attention to the details in the universe of this movie. The Wachoski brothers obviously came up with more backstory to fill in the holes after having realized how successful this movie would become. Some of the characters are well developed,and most of them I could root for, but all of them are given some truly terrible dialogue to work with. Both the delivery and the writing of the dialogue in this movie is bad. Not Transformers bad, mind you, but bad enough to take me out of the movie every time someone spoke. Hugo weaving is given the best lines in the movie, but he makes his lines work with the character he is portraying. The acting in this movie is average at best. While I'm quite certain that most of the characters were supposed to act cold and emotionless, some of the more, ahem, challenged actors in this movie can't act out cold and emotionless very well. Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Ross are completely unconvincing in their roles- and, considering they are both main characters, is a pretty big knock against this movie. Definitely not the masterpiece it is made out to be. 6 out of 10."
tt0068646,"I am glad to see that I am not the only one that just does not 'get' this movie. It is spoken of almost religiously,and it seems that if you dare ask 'why?',your sanity is questioned. Maybe people are overwhelmed by the big-name cast,and have been told so many times what a great movie this is, for so long, and are afraid to say different. All I know is that I heard and read endless,over-the-top praise for this movie for years and years. I managed to avoid seeing it until well over a decade after it was released. What a disappointment. I could not believe I was watching the same movie that I had heard so,so much about. I was absolutely astonished with how boring it was. I could not believe how disjointed it was. I could not believe the praise that Marlon Brando was given for such a weak,lackluster performance- it is goofy beyond parody.
As the film rambled and shambled along,I began to wonder if I was the victim of some sort of obscure joke-this crummy film could NOT be the same movie I had heard so much about. Unfortunately,somehow,
the universally-praised movie and this boring and bloated bomb I was seeing turned out to be one and the same.
Watch it on a rainy day and decide for yourself if this movie is worthy of all the hype."
tt1375666,"I had heard this movie was mind bending.It is always a risk to watch something that has been hyped up to be an intellectual masterpiece....because generally nothing will live up to your expectations.As others have stated, the ending was predictable, and several plot and dialogue elements seemed too contrived and banal. But for all that, it was a creative and entertaining thriller.Personally, I thought Blade Runner was more thought provoking and Memento more innovative.Maybe the problem is that I have seen so many of the movies from which this film seems to draw inspiration that Inception did not strike me as terribly original or thought provoking.Anyway, it was entertaining. Definitely worth a watch."
tt0848228,"And that is exactly what we have with The Avengers. Sam Peckinpah, the master director of mayhem, action, and blood-letting who broke down these Hollywood barriers in film over forty years ago recognized the necessity of character development for any action to have emotional meaning. As technically well-done as the Avengers is in all the action sequences, it lacks any human emotional qualities. Nobody but the most simple-minded that like mindless explosions and destruction will find any interest in this movie. A MOVIE is simple entertainment that will not past the test of time. A FILM is a work of art with quality and intelligence that will endure through the years. The Avengers is a 2-1/2 hour movie."
tt7286456,"In terms of production this film is on the A lost, however, I failed to draw any entertainment or value from this movie. Dont recommend it at all."
tt0993846,"To say I hated this film would be an understatement. I knew little about it, other than reading a review in Empire magazine a couple of days before. Approximately one hour in, I went and retrieved the magazine to read the review again because I could see no resemblance on screen to the reviewer's glowing praise on the page.Here I must admit to being female, and also totally appalled at the misogynistic, vile portrayal of just about every woman in this film. The only one that isn't pawed over, stripped and slapped about like a piece of meat is Jordan's first wife, but she is lied to, sidelined, betrayed and dropped as though she never meant a thing. The new wife that replaces her gets a 5 minute courtship, a honeymoon period of approximately the same duration, and is then firmly placed on the humiliation conveyor belt.As for the legions of whores and other apparently inconsequential women, just about every scene is filled with their degradation. Not even key colleagues get any respect, as one scene determinedly shows the only woman at work to be named down on her knees in a glass lift with her face firmly stuck to the front of some moron's flies.Yes, I am sure that being a woman has coloured my view of how women are portrayed in this film (and yes, the Empire reviewer was a man) but I notice I am not alone in being disgusted by the over-the-top porn and sheer vileness of behaviour that is revelled in and served up for what I am assured in other reviews is 2.1/2 hours. I probably lasted just over an hour before I gave up. Gave up hoping for any kind of story, gave up hoping for different characters instead of the same character assigned to just about every actor on screen. Gave up hoping that somebody, ANYBODY of the opposite sex might actually be treated fairly, even for half a minute.Where was the story? What was this about? What was the effect on the victims that were sold useless penny stocks? No, they don't feature either as the film relentlessly focuses on the bullies and morons that relieve them of their hard-earned cash with no glimpse of the consequences. When these heroes stop their carousing it is only to have pointless gibbering conversations about nothing which just serve to delay the orgies momentarily. Nothing is said that advances the story as the only story here is sex, drugs and exploitation. It is the pornographic equivalent of an evening looking at someone's boring holiday photos.There is zero progression, zero development, and - as far as I am concerned - zero interest in actually telling a story and entertaining the audience, just a determination to portray every excess known to man for no reason or purpose. Who cares if the real Jordan did any of this? I kept waiting for Vince Vaughn to show up as it was more like one of his puerile comedies than an Oscar-nominated film.I am old enough to have worked in a corporate environment in the City of London during the 80s. Yes the place was awash with money, but every woman was not treated like an expendable whore. Shame on Scorsese and all involved. I am no shrinking violet but so much emphasis on misogynistic, negative behaviour means little or no emphasis on anything else that could have made this a worthwhile film to watch. Ultimately it has nothing to say except F U, and does nothing but relieve the public of its entrance money with little return (true to its subject matter in that respect).This morning I watched District 9 which I had recorded on a whim and also knew nothing about. A film with plenty of heart, made on a tiny fraction of the budget blown on The Wolf of Wall Street, and to much greater effect. No prizes for guessing which of these films I would recommend."
tt0993846,"I think this is a very well crafted movie. The performances are excellent and the director and all his staff made a wonderful job. And this has the best dialog I have heard in years - despite the frequent f-words. Yes, this is one of the rags-to-riches-and-then-to-jail -movie. But somehow I missed the larger-in-life -character Gordon Gekko, who has already become a living legend although he is only a fiction from Stone's Wall Street. The main character is just a brat with addictions: drug, sex and money. Like a teenager-for-ever -type. He never grows and he never learns. At the end he is still making money for himself and some avid listeners. I hope his methods are legitimate now. But there is virtually no reference to the outside world. No political or philosophical connotations. And during this time inside Wall street was happening a lot! Later we found out what... So my only complaint is that this movie tries to be a Novel (apparently Epic Novel for 3 hours!)but manages in only being a short story."
tt0068646,"A timeless classic with some excellent acting and photography. Al Pacino delivers a great performance as does an ageing Brando. Interesting plot that keeps you hooked - violent and without morals which makes it a difficult watch at times. Stylish in production and excellent period scenes with great costumes and sets. The film is a good watch but for me personally I don't like the gangster subject matter and themes of the film, which I guess is why it's taken me so long to watch it in full."
tt0468569,"First I'll say, if you're one for the story and the 'why' of a character, in this movie, you will be disappointed. It was not the directors goal to explain everything about every character, and wanted to show the story instead. I feel that the story went along nicely. Most movies, I look at my watch, I'm not a movie person, this movie did NOT feel like 2 1/2 hours at all. I feel that Aaron Eckharts transformation from Harvey Dent to Two Face sucked. He didn't play Two Face up good enough... they had developed him as too much of a good guy, and didn't seem able to throw himself into the 'bad' Two face role. He needed to be more tormented when talking... more dramatic. He fell short as Two Face IMO. Ledgers Joker was perfect. He lost himself in that role. Sometimes when watching, you can see an actor through the part.. and that was not the case here. All you saw was Joker... crazy, funny, quirky Joker. Oscar worthy? maybe."
tt0361748,"This is the Tarantino Movie of the 2000's no doubt, carried by fictional storyline set in WW2 that can only be hoped to have been real.The main highlight of the film is not the storyline or Brad Pitt but a magnificent performance by Christoph Waltz who portrays his role and speaks multiple languages flawlessly. How can someone be so talented and underrated at the same time. His performance will make you root for him despite him being the villain.Storyline and screenplay were as usual very good and Mr Waltz truly deserved the Oscar for his role."
tt7286456,"The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh."
tt0268200,"Brigham City is now instantly one of my favorite films ever.  Always a huge fan of the independents, this one is spectacular, not only taking you into the intimate lives of these characters, but twisting and turning you through a suspenseful mystery.  Wow, Richard Dutcher really had his hands full in this drama, his story was unpredictable, I had no idea who the killer was, the twists kept me guessing, and wondering right up until the very end. The film is thought provoking and very uplifting for a murder mystery!!  The acting is strong, the plot line is tight, the production as a whole is top notch.  This is a movie I look forward to seeing again, just because it really make me feel good when I watch it.  There is something about this film, that I think is basically magical and I look forward to anything Dutcher puts out in the future!!See this movie, it's well worth your time!!"
tt0480820,"I admit, right now I would not play this game, with today's standards this game sucks.... very very bad Visible pixels, crappy sound, tough gameplay...However, I played this game around 1991-1992 and it ROCKED then. Had a lot of fun with it.It's a very simple fighting game, but back then it did not matter. It was It even had some cut-scenes.So in my opinion it really deserves more credit and less comparison to modern-day games.Never got to finish it though... when I was a little boy I jumped from 1 game to another, this game was in the time of Kings Quest 3, larry 3, Space Quest 1 and perestroika We ran games straight from DOS command prompt back then."
tt1345836,"There are plenty of elements that made this film work, so I suppose we can tick them off one by one. For starters, the continuation on the focus of Bruce Wayne's story, which has made it all tick. This version of Bruce Wayne and Alfred become the familiar characters we're accustomed with since 2005, and the film invests heavily on the emotional bonding between the two, which deals back to the theme about fear that rears its ugly head again, and how a father figure cannot stand idly by to watch the one he brought up recklessly charge into battle after a long hiatus, and hoping for a life of normalcy with the mantle of the bat given up. Michael Caine may have a shorter screen time than before, but no less powerful.When Sam Raimi had to put the popular and powerful Venom into Spider-man 3 pretty much against his wishes, we all knew how that turned out to be, effectively killing off the franchise until the decision to reboot it. There may be some similar fears with the introduction of a fairly contemporary villain in Bane, but the story gave him more purpose and meaning, and Tom Hardy was excellent par none in this role as the compete villain - with plenty of brawn, merciless, masterful, and with a plan any terrorist would be proud of. If the Scarecrow meant to induce fear, and the Joker to create chaos, Bane is carnage incarnate. Tom Hardy, even being the requisite mask, is fearful, and while the designs of his plan may dwarf the Joker's in complexity, it sure rivaled his in terms of delivery, and execution. Anyone in his path gets shoved aside with deadly consequences, and anyone alive is only because there is of further use. No hesitation, and no compromise.And Nolan continues with the introduction of a lot more villains big and small, behind a mask or otherwise, in his Bat films than anyone would credit him for, especially when having those whose lines are blurred, or corrupt to the core and hiding behind social status and fortune. This in turn provides for another arc that boils underneath the main narrative, where the rich and powerful continue to enjoy their successes at the expense of the have-nots, and the Occupy Movement in a way being a very real parallel to the proceedings on screen. While the mobsters were clearly at the top of the food chain in the earlier Nolan films, this one shifted focus to politicians and the elite community, with their fair share of scandals and corporate greed.While Bane was to the point, Selina Kyle played by Anne Hathaway, is both sensual and a force to be reckoned with herself, being like how she's best portrayed, on the fence. There's a bit of Frank Miller's Year One in this one given the presence of Juno Temple's Holly, and the back to basics as a jewel thief, compared to the mousy secretary in Tim Burton's Batman Returns with Michelle Pfeiffer defining the role, and the garbage that was Halle Berry's. Anne Hathaway nailed this one with what would be a truly memorable outing, and as if a homage of sorts to Burton's second Batman film, that the repartee between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle at a party became one of the highlights here, as does her thievery and combat ability. She may lack her whip, but more than makes up for it with her steel stiletto heels, and the very sensual and sleekly designed feline moves that you'd wonder how they got delivered while wrapped under that skin tight suit.And not only is the technology put on screen fictionally impressive, the technical aspects behind the scenes also worked wonders, chalking up serious mileage in having more than an hour's worth of footage shot on the IMAX format. Wally Pfister's cinematography continues to impress with that staying consistent to the gritty look and feel developed for all the Bat films to date, before his departure into a film director's role for his next project. Hans Zimmer also probably developed the best score for Nolan's Bat films, and I dare say without which this film would be less stellar, with the score playing a huge role in adding plenty of character and emotion to the film, lifting it up with excitement during the many set action pieces, with recognizable themes assigned to major players, heightening dangers, and providing a boost to the many feelings in this one heck of an action-adventure.With how things developed at the end, and what I felt was initial horror of sorts with Batman out in broad daylight, secret identity being porous and all, this film ended in what would be the best way possible - with possibilities, and a twinkle of an eye, Inception style with a did it, or did it not. Twists, turns, surprises and sleight of hand, making it a clear favourite as one of the best this year. Do yourself a favour and watch it in the IMAX format, just as it was intended.Because you have just got to believe in Christopher Nolan, and the kind of films he has so far delivered. Take a bow, bat-crew, for a trilogy that has now set the bar for any comic book film, and especially any other follow Batman movie, reboot or otherwise, to live up to."
tt1345836,"Morgan Freeman's character goes from clever to worthless. Alfred goes on and on about what's going to happen to Bruce when we know that Alfred is always right so he's practically giving the plot away. Bane could apparently do so much with no ease you become numb and unimpressed by his character. Stronger than everyone, able to hack anything, everything. Seems to know where everything is effortlessly, where the reactor is, batmans batcave, how to hack the stock market, find 100s of thugs who have no prob committing suicide when the bomb goes off, c'mon. So far fetched. So unintelligent unlike the dark knight. Colliard's character was the most unsatisfying, not to mention unconvincing twist. I could go on and on about this movie..Jesus"
tt0137523,"A dark comedy with a cult following. Director David Fincher takes Chuck Palaniuk's novel to maybe a harsher and dangerous place. Known only as The Narrator(Edward Norton)is a corporate employee that is no longer enchanted by his elaborate apartment and its expensive furnishings and pretty much disenfranchised from life itself and is concerned with his lack of ability to sleep. He attends self-help groups to relish in not being as miserable as the people surrounding him. He meets a suicidal Marla Singer(Helena Bonham Carter), but wants to distance himself from her. Life changing is his meeting with a soap salesman Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt), who is anarchy's poster child. Durden thrives on being a roguish rebel and convinces The Narrator into staging impromptu boxing matches in parking lots and deserted building basements. These matches are bare chested and with bare knuckles. The fighters beat the living crap out of each other until one yells stop. Durden is credited with starting fight clubs across the nation; and eventually turns the clubs into aggression laden pranksters releasing their malice on corporate America.Brutal violence and strong language is to be expected along with some pretty graphic images. Also in the cast: Meat Loaf, David Andrews, Zach Grenier, Jared Leto and Eion Bailey."
tt0102926,"I really hate Silence of the Lambs.  Because I hate this movie so much I have come here to vent my frustrations.  This is the most overrated movie ever made and I am sorry that I wasted 2 hours of my life watching it.  I have not and will not see the sequels because the original is so terrible. The only award this movie should have been nominated for is ""Stupidest Movie of the Year."""
tt0120737,"First off: As far as fantasy movies go this is a fairly good one. It is just orders of magnitude above the likes of e.g. ""Dungeons and Dragons"" but that is mainly due to the abysmal quality of those flicks.But how does LotR compare to other, ""normal"" films? Well, that's a mixed bag. From a technical point of view: It does employ several interesting techniques such as blurring, out of focus filming, or the rather good visualisation of Frodos shadow world experiences. Additionally, the ""shrinking"" of the Hobbits works extremely and surprisingly well...apart from some minor occurences that left me feeling a bit uneasy (without being able to say why) the film manages to let the audience accept and believe the differences in height between humans (etc.) and hobbits.As for the ""stunning visuals"": Lots of people claim New Zealand is an amazing country and does offer beautiful and breathtaking locations around every corner. I've never been there myself, so I just have to  assume they know what they are talking about... and the LotR-FotR movie has not done much to change that. And that is because of the massive employment of CGS. Almost every single scene that displays the world of Middle Earth is  in one way or the other either completely computer generated or computer ""enhanced"". This is of course inevitable when it comes to locations such as Rivendell or Moria (and these almost invariably look great), but... The problem is that even nowadays it is still possible to tell CGS from filmed ones and imho too many computer generated scenes in too short a span of time convey a feeling of irreality. I know, the story is supposed to take place a long time ago, when the world looked different and there were still elves and dwarves and magic around, but LotR-FotR managed to give me the ""Oh no, not another CGS"" feeling. It would have preferred if the weather peak had been an ordinary film set, for example. All in all, however, I really liked the technical side of the movie.Now for the story (I'm going to announce spoilers, but there are almost none): Obviously a movie isn't a book. Deviations in style and story are inevitable when translating one into another. However, I don't think FotR  manages particularly well. Let me explain:The significance and power of the one ring (and the other rings as well) are insufficently introduced. (2 minor SPOILERs ahead) Gandalf states ""I don't want the ring, I would use for good things."" Fullstop. So what? Likewise Galadriels ""fit"" is hard to understand without the background information of the book. Her words: ""But I pass the test. I will diminish and go into the west and stay Galadriel"" are especially bad. How is someone who hasn't read the books supposed to know why she will ""diminish"" and ""go ito the west"", whatever that means. The relationship between the one ring and the elven rings and the dilemma and the sacrifice of the elves is completely left out of the movie!Often the movie introduces certain places (Gate of Rohan, Moria, Caradhras, Lothlorien, Mordor, and especially Gondor and the White City), without giving the audience any idea of what they mean and where they are. Sure, you can't put all the background information of a book into the movie, but neglecting it completely can't be the best way to go. (minor SPOILERS ahead) As it is, FotR conveys NO information at all about the significance of Gondor for example, or why the fellowship has to stay on the west side of the mountains, or why they can't pass the Gate of Rohan, what the mines of Moria were and are and where the hell this ""Mordor"" is in the first place. It thus fails to set the stage for the following movies.The main focus of the movie seems to be the display of fights or flights. So it is either Aragorn stabbing Orcs or the hobbits running away. The remaining time is used to loosely connect these scenes with each other. Of course, this generates a lot of action and suspense but given the intricate story of the books this doesn't work particularly well. Someone who hasn't read the books is likely to get the idea that the books are just your everyday fantasy literature with some band of adventurers hacking and slashing away at Orcs to accomplish this goal or another. Which it isn't. SPOILER ahead: I feel that the time of some of the overly long fighting/suspense scenes (especiallythe fight with the troll in Moria and the scene on the collapsing stair) would have been better spent on some more background information, character development and/or just plain conversation.There are other (minor) points of criticism, e.g.: the way in which the course of events has been changed in the movie, which gives rise to some questions, (SPOILER ahead) for example how Gandalf managed to complete the journey to Isengard, his imprisonment and the escape in the same time which Frodo needed to get from the Shire to Rivendell. , but since none of these points weigh as heavily as the ones outlined above I will leave them out of this review for the sake of brevity.As a conclusion: From my point of view, the movie felt like a flat stone skipping over water, touching certains point in the book (mainly fights), and then jumping to the next, without following a visible path. So I don't think that LotR-FotR ist ""the best of movie ever"" or ""of the century"", not even ""of the year"" (my personal favourite is Amelie), nor is it a ""masterpiece"". It is a rather good fantasy movie which  utilizes the main ideas of the LotR books to display lots of running and fighting. It seriously fails to set the stage for the movies to come, fails to motivate the actions of the Fellowship as it should, fails to flesh out the characters sufficiently and completely fails to include even the slightest bit of the history and shape of Middle Earth which make Lord of the Rings such an extraordinary book. And if you have seen (and maybe even liked) the movie but haven't read the books, then for heavens sake go out and buy a copy of them as soon as possible, there is just so much more in the books than the film even gives an idea of!P.S.: Please excuse my bad english, this is also the reason for the ""brevity"" and not very good argumentative structure of this review..."
tt0167261,"The problem with this movie is that Peter Jackson seem to believe that Middle- earth is somewhere in the Star Wars galaxy or on board James Camerons Titanic. Therefore he has re-written the story from the book in an attempt to make it ""bigger and better"". In the original text there where no fun side-kicks with good one-liners and there where not enough cool toys so Peter had to throw in some Orc wolf riders and dwarf jokes. Then he find Frodos meeting with Faramir to be a bit too boring in the book, so he ""spice it up"" with a ""dramatic"" scene where Frodo stands in front of a ring wraith trying to give it the ring. Yeah baby! There are also plenty of not good enough acting from the extras. Extremely theatrical lines like ""Look it's the king!"" are a bit too common. If you thought the books where boring then maybe this is a film for you. Now there are plenty of ""fun"" side-kicks in it to save you from embarrassing seconds of silence or non-action. If you actually liked the books, stay away from this movie."
tt0993846,"If this movie had been sharper and shorter it would have been OK.As it is, the fairly rudimentary story of a sort that has been told so many time before is dragged out for three soporific hours.DiCaprio is fine in his role, but not great. You see the moves but never feel them. The rest of the characters are cardboard cut outs.The nudity is there, I think, to distract viewers and keep them titillated so that the predictable script is accepted.With average acting, a mediocre script and too much time it is far from the great movie I was expecting it to be.The biggest disappointment of the season.I think it is time to go and rent 1987's Wall Street."
tt0111161,"Some consider it a masterpiece, some just an example of experienced film-making. I'm sticking with the second opinion. I really do like The Shawshank Redemption, mainly because of its actors, but it remains a movie which pretends to tell a shocking story while using black-and-white schemes, unlikely characters (Andy Dufresne makes some saints look like amateurs) and incomplete character backgrounds. It is utterly unauthentic wherever you bother to question its settings or characters.A better prison movie should at least give the audience an idea of what rape, the loss of freedom, the loss of contact to your family and friends, bad conditions and dullness can really do to a person.I like the movie when it manages to show me how Brooks isn't able to adapt the outside world anymore. I find it mediocre when it tries to tell me the story of true friendship, strength and hope itself lying within a prison. I do not like it when it sells me men who manage to get through such hard times without developing any kind of trauma or negative characteristics."
tt0372784,"This 140-minute film we have here is the first from writer and director Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and if he wasn't considered a top-notch director before already, then this film lifted him up into the elite where he still is today with everybody talking about Dunkirk. But we talked about that one on another occasion already and now lets take a look at the only film from the trilogy that is missing the ""Dark Knight"" in the title. The lead actor in this over 10-year-old film is of course Christian Bale still before his Oscar win and it's not about great acting from him here as it is all about the story. But still for example the likes of Neeson and Caine managed awards-worthy performances. It was a pretty good idea to have Wayne's mentor and trainer become his worst enemy at the very end and it also fits really well with Nolan's dark 0% comedy approach to Gotham City, very different from Burton or West or everybody else. It's almost a catastrophe movie, well with what is happening to Gotham it is and the tone fits in well, also with Bruce's emotional state. I personally could have done without the Scarecrow story as he felt rushed in, but he is also not a character to be a main antagonist for an entire film really, at least not with Murphy playing the character or Scarecrow's looks. Tough challenge. Maybe make the mafia boss or Hauer's character more influential instead with the time gained. Or just make it a 110-minute film.Freeman and Oldman well they were okay I guess, but also as I like them both I expected a bit more. Holmes at least brings in one female character and that's good. But in the center of it all, it is about Wayne making his peace with the past and finding his determination and destiny and like I said the way they used the League of Shadows (Neeson), it was truly interesting in my opinion. People generally consider this film probably the second best from the trilogy after film number 2, but I would say it is my least favorite. That doesn't mean it was weak or anything though. It only means that the other two are better. At the end of this one here, we get a very interesting reference already about a certain clown character turning Batman's life into hell in the sequel. As for this one here, I recommend seeing it in the unlikely case that you still haven't. Only people who really hate superhero films should skip it and it's probably also not an essential watch to appreciate films 2 and 3. I know it is not a superhero film really, but still it is very similar. There are some lengths in the middle part and overlong action sequences, but these style-over-substance parts don't keep it from becoming a quality movie. Go check it out, these almost 2.5 hours certainly fly by."
tt7286456,"A freaking lengthy break-down ahead,but worth it(I guess?)..
Might contain a few spoilers,but if you haven't watched it yet. SERIOUSLY,what are you doing with your life?To begin with. Todd Phillips. Everyone's going,""man,he's the same guy,that directed The Hangover,right?how was such a guy,capable,of pulling this off?"",for starters,SO WHAT?,as a matter of fact,most of his movies,are comical,you only found The Hangover series?..
Jokes aside,Todd,has literally sculpted this masterpiece,frame by frame. I overheard,that this film,was influenced by Scorsese's-'King Of Comedy' and 'The Taxi Driver',and people were actually,debating,if they liked this film or not,solely,'cause of the fact that this derived some inspiration from cult-classics,like those two?Please!,this is a period film,and blends rather very well with the theme of 'King Of Comedy' and 'The Taxi Driver',so what's wrong,in drawing a little inspiration?annoyed that,this reminds you a lot of those two?(then,I really don't have an answer for that)
The music,scored by Hildur ""I-can't-pronounce-after-that"",was phenomenal,it adds on to the chilly vibes of the film,and instills fear in us,and makes us grateful,that we aren't(literally)on the receiving end of this clown's menace.Her score,when Arthur dies(psychologically speaking) and The Joker,rises,in the bathroom,is just freaking too-good!The man behind the cam,Lawrence,has killed it too!(I don't know much about the intricacy of cinematography,so don't really want to blabber,much)
Finally,Joaquin Phoenix. You must have,by now,heard,a lot of critical acclamations,praising his acting,and that,he really deserves an OSCAR,for this,and also,some clich√© comments,going ""Oh my God!,OSCAR deserves JOAQUIN,for his performance!""
Well,the HYPE IS TRUE!"
tt0120815,"Whoa, I have just read some of the other reviews and it seems that if you dont like this film you must be anti-american.Now dont get me wrong, the opening scene was brilliant but to me it quickly settled into being just another war movie albeit a well produced and shot war movie. You know, the good ol' USofA rising up above  insurmountable odds to save the day blah blah blah.I just could not accept the basic premise of the film that several men's lives were to be put at risk for the reasons given, I mean war is war, stuff like that happens.Having said that I could accept this scenario happening today, (re Jessica Ryan) with all the ensuing publicity.I think part of the problem was my expectation. I was expecting a real anti-war film, one that leaves you thinking, you know, that war is bad. This was just another good guys (America), bad guys (Germans) type film.If you want to see a real, and I mean real anti-war film you must see the 1930 version of ""All quiet on the Western front"". Ask me the ending of Private Ryan and in three months I wont be able to tell you, but our High School teacher made us sit through this when I was about 13/14 and to this day the final scene still jars me.Go see it, trust me, it will move you more than Ryan. (look it up on imdb it has scored 8.2 to ryans 8.3)But whats the use, people who gave Private Ryan a 10 will probably be bored with it because it is one war film that has little violence in it (and it is full of ""shudder"" Germans)."
tt0167261,"This is the war. This is the necessary part of the film to set up the finale. Because it's the middle child, it doesn't get the attention or respect. Once one has all three films in hand, he can begin to view them as a single entity. Still they are considered to be separate. The arising of the Gollum. The series of battles that make up this film are so incredible. Though made at the same time, the tales gain the advantage of advances in production techniques and graphics. There is not much exposition here, though new characters are made available to us. It is rather to get from point A to point B and make way for the final book. The rocky relationship between Frodo and Sam continues, Frodo fixated on the ring and all that it implies. Then there are the magnificent battle scenes with the unlikeliest of creatures forming alliances. I read reviews by people who are so into these books that they nitpick over every aberration from the original works. This is a movie. It's accessible to anyone, including those who will never make their way through the novel. The novels aren't for everyone. They are filled with long introspective meanderings and a good deal of poetry (hardly any of which is in any of the three films). Like with Trekkies, it's hard to talk with these people because of the obsessiveness about a single piece of literature--the betrayal they feel. Just enjoy what Peter Jackson was able to do. It will live forever in film history."
tt1375666,"Say what you want of Nolan, the new populist demigod of Hollywood: that his movies are overplotted, his themes overstated, his structure wonky. However, you have to give it to Chris: he is generous. Other writers/directors live and die by a single gimmick, but he keeps throwing more and more ambitious stuff at the screen - he reminds me of Philip K. Dick, another artist who casually poured in a few pages more ideas than many of his colleagues used in a half-dozen books.Nolan has the same high-concept vitality: amnesiac protagonist tries to avenge his wife guided by tattoos on his body and Polaroid pictures (still his best, by far); a feud between illusionists in early 20th century London gets increasingly nasty.In Inception, con men use a special technology to navigate through people's dreams and steal their secrets. From the tone-perfect James Bond prologue to the climactic hurricane of set pieces, the movie transcends its limits - its clunky rules and the fact the dream world mechanics are not exploited as creatively as they could have - and succeeds thanks to its juicy premise and jaw-dropping cast, with Di Caprio in another of his ""tormented young man"" turns he has been perfecting since The Departed, Michael Caine, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy.Then we have gorgeous Marion Cotillard in Inception's most poignant idea - the protagonist, obsessed by his dead wife, tries to recreate her, but she ends up as a distorted, menacing memory haunting his fragile dream world.8/10"
tt0468569,"Heath Ledger is the star of the show, but the acting in the move is great on all sides. The pacing, the sets, the music is wonderfully shot and make you sad when the end credits start to roll. This is the type of movie that I try to watch at least once a year. It also cemented my option of Christopher Nolan as one of the great directors of the current generation. It would have been amazing to see where Heath Ledger could have gone in his career, based on his iconic performance in this movie. Nitpicks: Christian Bale's voice changes are a little odd, and I don't know if they are necessary for the movie to get its point across."
tt1853728,"Well lets come out and say it, this is an awful movie, I don't care what blinkered Tarantino fans say, this is trash. No one dare say anything against this guy , but hopefully one day someone other will seriously look at this and will see through the hype and say no the stuff he makes isn't pastiche of films from yester year, lets be fair about it , the movies of this ilk were crap then and nothing has changed. The camera shots are those of an amateur, the acting for most part is wooden, (Fox in particular acts like a Pinochio puppet with all the emotional charisma of clotted cream ) De Caprio is perhaps the only sparkle in this drab, very drab affair. The script is laughable and the repeated shots of the worst Kensington Gore I have ever seen being thrown up walls is quite truthfully childish. As for the end shots , surely a candidate for the raspberry awards. Sorry, if this thing had been made by anyone other than this director then audiences, even American ones, would have given it the thumbs down. But I guess all will hail this masterpiece of garbage and not see it for what it is. A poorly made piece of amateur stuff whose plot just doesn't hold up, made by actors who at times look embarrassed to be there, shame they were really."
tt0172495,"I ordered this movie in a hotel room for 10 dollars in hopes that I would be watching a possible Best Picture nominee. Instead, I watched a confusing, poorly executed excuse for a movie. The first war scene's camera angles and overall layout had me wondering who was who. I hope other people did not have to pay 10 dollars to watch such a disappointment."
tt0816692,"I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie.And this is IT!When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are.These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years).Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him ""X"". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet).Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly ""X"", will managed to convince you about that.My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say ""we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick"" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that.This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought."
tt0167260,"Don't get me wrong, these movies are very well made. It's amazing that these books were actually made into films in the first place. It takes a lot of vision to accomplish that. However, as a film or even a trilogy, there are several fallbacks. Firstly, there is a lot of unneeded dialogue. Secondly, after the audience waits for the climax and then the rundown at the end of the film, the movie doesn't end. It feels it needs to tie up loose ends that most audience members won't see, such as what happens to Bilbo. All in all, the vision deserved the Academy Award, although as always, there is room for improvement."

tt0468569,"I finally saw this movie because everyone kept talking about it. But for anyone who has seen more than a few movies (ie somebody over 20) there is just nothing there. Even without the hype I found this movie to be really painfully bad. A few points:---It seems the movie is trying to be realistic starting with something that looks like a somewhat believable heist. But then there are so many totally improbable things like batman's hideout and gadgets, the joker somehow getting zillions of minions, etc. So which is it a gritty crime movie or fantasy? I can't tell.---Haven't we seen ""witty"" dialog like this 100 times:Batman: ""Let her go"" Joker: ""Oh, very poor choice of words"" (drops her out window)When this happened my jaw dropped. This is worse than a Rambo movie.---I get it that Heath Ledger playing The Joker is supposed to be some crazy psycho. Hardly original or award worthy. Just looked like a hundred others we have seen before in other movies.---All ""characters"" are totally off-the-shelf. There's no depth or surprise to them at all.---What does Rachel Dawes see in Bruce Wayne? In the scene in the restaurant (""I own the place"") he seems like a braggart and feels the need to arrive at his own party in a helicopter with three arm candy women on his arm. (Why isn't he already at his own place?)---Oh look a fancy party in Wayne's penthouse. I wonder what's going to happen? Look the bad guy comes in a starts tormenting people. Then Wayne has to change into his batman costume to save the day. How is this not 110% predictable.---Again, is the movie supposed to be realist? When arrested The Joker would really be forced to wash the makeup off his face.---Bruce Wayne saves the armored truck from a collision by placing his Lamborghini in between it an on coming truck. Aren't armored trucks stronger than sports cars. Yeah, I know Wayne has some magic tech. So at this point we are supposed to suspend disbelief.---I could go on. Obviously some people really like this movie. That's great but please don't say its anything like the best movie ever until you have seen some films from the AFI's lists http://www.afi.com/10TOP10/"
tt0361748,So I balanced it out. This review is too short but its too the point. Watch it. Judge it yourself.
tt0108052,"I didn't see this movie till recent. But I've been told it's violent and very well received back in 1993. I'm 17 so it was OK for me to see a movie like this.Anyways Schindler's List takes place during WW2. And those who attended history class would know that Adolf Hitler had total control in most parts of Europe and banned all Jewish activity and removed all the Jewish from their homelands. It was the grimmer moment in the entire Jewish history.A man named Oscar Schindler was a business man and a Nazi. Only he was different from other Nazis. He provides the Jews work at his company only if they have working experience. Schindler in secretly does not kill or torture any Jews. He finds the whole thing wrong in a way. But he doesn't adment it because he's might receive serious consciences if he were to say he likes Jews.He makes sure his Jews aren't killed or sent to the more lethal concentration camps by making a list of hundreds of Jews that he bought with his own money. With that list he could be able to grant their freedom by the time the war is over.This movie is very well made. Spielberg did a great job in recreating this time period. I can see why it was given an Oscar during the 1993 Accadmy Awards. It's also interesting that 3/4s of the movie is shot in Black and White.It's strongly recommended for any Spielberg collection. Just know this movie isn't for everyone. It has swearing, violence, and some strong nudity. It's not for kids so I'd recommend it for ages 16 and up or at least someone mature enough to see a violent movie.It might offend certain Jews or those who are offended by Nazis as well."
tt0372784,"I can't believe you Batman fans! I can't believe anyone really liked this movie! It's a total BS film that destroyed the story of Batman. The movie wasn't even that enjoyable, it was brought more into a horror movie than a comic book or even a whimsical/corny TV show. Christain Bale as Batman? He's better than George Clooney, that's for sure, but he didn't give much depth to his character. It's like ""Look! My voice can get scary! I'm Batman! No, really, I am!"". Katie Holmes? I'm recently ticked off with her and Tom, so I'm going to back off and just pretend she wasn't in the movie at all. The villain? Who was it? There was no main one!Plot holes!!!! There were a million. OK, supposedly, this homeless person killed Bruce's parents, NOPE! WRONG! It was Joker, and even before Jack became the Joker, he was a smooth gangster. Not a homeless man if you will. Also, this is supposed to be a prequel to the first Batman? Then why are people using cell phones and updated cars? The first Batman was set in the 80's.Jeez, people! I'm not trying to be all harsh on this film, but this was in no way the best Batman!4/10"
tt1375666,"I vaguely remember the time i watched this movie (which was a long long time ago), but i definitely remember being blown away by this masterpiece. I would love to experience something similar again."
tt0372784,"Now I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a big comic book reader, and perhaps this has clouded my judgement on this film but having seen it, after all the hype, this film is, in my opinion, rubbish. What angered me the most wasn't the story as such, but the directing. The beginning was painful slow to the point of boredom, the fight scenes were a blurry mess and was there any need to treat the audience like goldfish by replaying the scene with the stethoscope and his father again at the end of the movie when Bruce picks up the burnt remains. We can remember, you only showed us an hour ago!!! Not what I expected. I should have waited for the DVD release from Blockbuster."
tt1375666,I literally didn't even know what was going on half the time its like a dream in a dream in a dream in a dream in a dream lol.
tt0120737,"""With the help of a courageous fellowship of friends and allies, Frodo embarks on a perilous mission to destroy the legendary 'One Ring'. Hunting Frodo are servants of the Dark Lord Sauron, the Ring's evil creator. If Sauron reclaims the Ring, Middle-earth is doomed,"" according to the DVD sleeve description, ""Winner of four 'Academy Awards', this epic tale of good versus evil, friendship and sacrifice will transport you to a world beyond imagination.""Reading the original J.R.R. Tolkien novels was an intellectual rite of passage; whilst young, you read and enjoyed ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy willingly - prepping with ""The Hobbit"", of course. ""It's a job that's never started that takes the longest to finish,"" someone said. Writer/director Peter Jackson's ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is the first of an extremely well-produced trilogy. Understandably, it's made into a special effects extravaganza, without taking many breaths for thoughtfulness.""The Bridge of Khazad-D√ªm"" (#30 on your DVD menu) sequence is a highlight; it climaxes with the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the demonic Balrog (CGI) falling into an abyss, from which return seemed impossible This was one of my most memorable ""Lord of the Rings"" reading experiences - a future without Gandalf was unimaginable. Mr. Jackson and company recreate some emotional scenes extraordinarily well. At one time, it seemed impossible to think that such literature could be brought to cinematic form.******** The Fellowship of the Ring (12/10/01) Peter Jackson ~ Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom"
tt0167260,"Obviously, I'm aware of the fact that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually one giant movie, but since it was released in parts, that's how I'm judging them. The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.At this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters, and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come.This is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.These were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best, in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm one of them.Sorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that's a bit depressing.My rating: 10/10"
tt0167260,"First, let me say that I did like ""Return of the King."" It's a special effects masterpiece that is destined to become a classic, along with the first two installments in the ""Lord of the Rings"" saga.But, to me, it was far less enjoyable than the first two films, the second of which was the best of the three.""King"" was far too long for what it had to say. And the ending (or should I say endings) really disappointed me. I kept waiting for the film to end, but it just kept going on and on. There were at least four times that I thought the film was over, but then the next scene would fade in. It would have been a much better ending if the film had finished with the resolution of the final battle, and then showed the denouement as a montage next to the closing credits. It would have removed about 20 minutes from the overly-lengthy film and would have made the ending less of a ""cut-and-paste"" style.So I'll give it a solid 7. But to me, it has been seriously over-rated by both fans and critics. I'm surprised that more of the critics, at least, haven't picked up on the weak ending."
tt0114369,"I'm sorry for those of you who think that a watered-down pseudo-sadistic murder spree makes for compelling or an intelligent film.  It doesn't.Let's set aside for the moment the miserable lighting and cinematography in this film -- half the movie is so monochromatic that it's difficult to tell what you're looking at, and the 'artistic' angles compound the problem.Let's set aside the absolutely rotten characterizations -- Freeman tries hard with his portrayal of the absolutely-cookie-cutter jaded soon-to-retire cop, but there's nothing there, and Brad Pitt's scenery-chewing over-the-top ""look at me, I'm sooooo mad!"" rookie-detective turn is, frankly, laughably silly.  Gwyneth Paltrow has absolutely nothing to do, and Spacey's character is...well, he's not a character.  He's a bit of hackneyed dialogue, without motive, without charisma, without even a semi-consistent tone (we're supposed to believe that this infinitely careful killer is also so ramblingly incompetent that he leaves evidence all over his apartment?  That he's so confident he knocks off cops' wives, but so easily frazzled he loses his cool under light questioning in the police car?Let's instead focus on plot holes so wide you could toss a horse through them.What kind of police department is this?  There is not ONE ATTEMPT to answer some of the obvious questions that would be asked in any murder investigation (is there surveillance video of the lawyer's offices (there would be)?  Where did the killer get his antibiotics (those things are tracked, numbskulls)?  Why aren't the cops even TRYING to predict the killer's victim pattern, after they've been given ridiculously explicit hints?  Most importantly, the entire ending is completely implausible...under no circumstances would any department, anywhere, EVER, send two detectives off with the high-profile confessed murderer like that. When Spacey proposes his little 'deal,' the cops would have said ""tough. Rot in jail, sicko.""I suppose the success of ""Se7en"" proves that if you shower an audience with enough slickly-produced gore (not even that imaginatively rendered), they'll buy it, particularly if you layer on some random pseudo-literary quotation to give it a sheen of ""art.""  A sad comment on the state of the horror genre."
tt0535990,"This Excellent episode was more of a showcase for Caesar Danova, once billed as the next Valentino. Danova's claim to fame was playing one of Liz Taylor's lovers in CLEOPATRA. Although Danova was Italian, he plays a Spanish con-man here who hires Cannon to get him out of the country, pretending to be a political prisoner hunted by assassins. Danova is such a fiend he also attempts to murder Cannon. What a work of art!10 STARS.Robert C. Dennis, long associated with Alfred Hitchcock's tv show, basically wrote this story as a portrait of a scoundrel. No other way to spell it. Catch the clever dialogue, which Dennis was well known for. One of the best writers in town, and a friend of William Conrad'sTwo veteran actors appear here; Peter Mamacos (as Vicente) generally cast as a heavy, and James Dolan, in a bit as a desk sergeant, an actor you have seen for years but never knew his name. More than likely all these good folks worked with Bill Conrad at Warner Brothers/ABC TV.Of honorable mention is squeeky-voice John Fielder, usually playing harrassed gentlemen and eccentric villains. One of his best roles was on ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS as a serial killer.There's a wild bus ride.... HOWEVER... the real treat is Cannon wearing a GIANT sombrero and getting even with Barbara Luna, Danova's ex-girlfriend, literally left holding the bag! She deserved it, without giving too much away. A funny gag for the show seen many times in clips.Credit all the adventure to director Richard Donner, behind SUPERMAN and LETHAL WEAPON.

tt0120737,"While Lord of the Rings is one of the most widely known and loved movie and book franchises in the world, it is not the movie for me. I can recognize why it's so popular, it brought a new standard for special effects to the 2000's and a classic book to life. However, after enduring four hours of little men with hairy feet panicking over a ring, I believe it's slightly overrated.This isn't the most ground-breaking movie ever created but it does deserve a substantial amount of credit. I have watched both the extended and non- extended version and neither were very riveting, despite being adventure stories. As someone who is not the biggest fan of the fantasy genre, this movie was very hard to get into. The most entertaining part of the movie was Frodo's facial expressions and the 2001 fighting scene special effects. The extended version even threw in some questionable and off-putting extreme close ups of Gandalf's face and hobbit feet. However, there is something to be said for the number of movies the Lord of The Rings influenced after its release and the attention to detail within the franchise. It had some exceptionally stunning shots and the complex world building carried from the book to the movie was well executed. Although I don't wish to ever watch this movie again, I acknowledge that it unearthed a new side to fantasy that raised the bar significantly."
tt7286456,"Cannot understand why this movie gets high score. The content is so bad, gloomy and unreasonable. It is exaggerated too much. How can a mad guy who kill 03 men become a symbol for a mad society??? How can rich men always badly treat or make difficulty to poor guy??? Any reason for a mad crowd tries to protest a senator who is just only standing as a candidate for President position???
Three stars for the good performance of main character."
tt0102926,"This is the first time my opinion vastly diverges from the public one. For me this is just a plain movie, no suspense, no fear, boring at times and just confusing at others. The saving grace is Hopkins which acted amazingly. Foster on the other hand...is just annoying with her accent and general demeanor. She truly was like a lamb when speaking to Lecter which might be intentional but is just annoying. I also get that the shots were filmed in a way to make the space look smaller and more close up to amp up the anxiety but there were so many cuts, close ups etc. that again were annoying. I didn't feel anything during or after the movie which would justify the ""phycological thriller or horror"" title."
tt0120815,"The first 30 minutes are great but after that the movie makes little sense. Aside from the totally ridiculous plot, the actions of the characters is pure hollywood fiction. The way they walk around nonchalantly, the bars on Hank's helmet (why not a bull's-eye), and the ridiculous notion of a sniper going anywhere near a bell tower are the things that bothered me the most. Why would they face overwhelming odds to save a bridge that the engineers could rebuild in a day? Denying it to the fleeing Germans would have been the priority. Faced with the odds that they were up against even a corporal would have had the military sense to blow the bridge before the Germans arrived and have everyone safely on the other side. Hey Spielberg, What's with the neo-nazi skinhead German soldiers? I have never seen a photograph of a WWII German soldier with a haircut remotely resembling this. I realize that actual soldiers were used as extras but you have to assume actors were given the speaking/close-up roles. Expected much more from all of the hype ¬ñ sorely disappointed by all the Hollywood glam."
tt0172495,"Gladiator had it's moments, but was altogether too blunt and predictable. There was some superb acting, but the way the film was put together just comes off being very superficial.  If a ten-year old boy was to make a movie, this would be their approach.In a certain sense, the setting of the film was a time of rather simple people, so in that sense the movie could work.  However, all these dream sequences are tacked on seemingly to try and give the movie some kind of deeper credibility.  In that sense, the movie as a whole fails.  Too bad for Phoenix, Crowe & Nielsen who turn in fine performances. Excellent makeup too!"
tt0372784,"Tim Burton made Batman look a bit childish in Michael Keaton's figure, and were always beaten by his great villains in both Batman (1989) and the fabulous sequel. But then suddenly Joel Schumacher decided to trash and destroy everything that was cool, stylish and fascinating about the knight of night. So he made Val Kilmer do Batman and topped it all in 1997 by making the horrifyingly bad Batman & Robin that included a terrible Arnie as the main bad-guy.Christopher Nolan, the man behind MEMENTO and INSOMNIA decided making a whole new start to the famous story of one of the most beloved superheroes of all time. BATMAN BEGINS offers a totally new and inspiring gem into the whole Gotham setting. And Nolan ends of his trilogy of psychological settings here; were MEMENTO were lead by memory loss, INSOMNIA followed up with a sleepless Pacino and here he tops it with phobia and fear. And casting Christian Bale as Batman was surely a good move, the former Patrick Bateman looks as his on the edge of breaking all the time, making him intense and pretty scary in his look and atmosphere.We meet down-and-out billionaire Bruce Wayne that's being held in a prison in China. Being a pretty aggressive person he joins the League Of Shadows up in a Himalaya monastery were he's thought totally new skills, but he refuses their methods and returns to his home town Gotham. After his troubled childhood he still suffers from phobia, returning to get rid of the criminality that killed his parents, he dresses in black as Batman and teams up with the only fair people in the city...And Gotham looks better than ever. Not being that peculiar and interesting as Burton's Germanish inspired dark-goth, and not as pathetic and cyber as Schumacher's new wave punk - it looks fashionable but under the surface it suffers from crime and gangsters, violence and cheating. The underworld AND over-world worth remarking, is lead by corrupt cops and laws, mafia bosses that doesn't press charges but shoots you (Tom Wilkinson) and a creepy Scarecrow doing the dirty jobs as a pleasure. In here Batman takes his loop as the dark knight he is and gets allied with off course his best friend, butler Alfred ( played wonderfully by old-English Michael Caine), the policeman (Gary Oldman), Wayne Enterprises R&D man (Morgan Freeman, perfect choice!) and uses his childhood sweetheart (Katie Holmes) just as much as an informant on the law-side as a love interest.And Batman looks better than ever; his dark voice and aggressive attacks leaves old man Keaton and Schumacher's choices as pathetic baby bats. So, flying like a bat and stinging like a bee, Batman's back for business. Filled with great actor performances, amazing action, great CGI, fine dialog and absolutely great settings; Batman Begins is the best Batman movie so far. And one more thing; the Batmobile rocks! Or is it a car or a tanks?"
tt0816692,"Somewhere in Interstellar is a decent 90 minute movie padded to 3 hours. I thought it might feel long; what I didn't expect was the cheap, weepy emoting and Hallmark philosophizing.As for the padding, at least 40 minutes goes by before anyone mentions space, yet nothing of the ecological disaster is explained in any depth. No point is so trivial it can't be made ten times, no scene so long it can't be stretched beyond the breaking point. And oh, the sap ‚Äì love is described as a kind of quantum effect that transcends time and space (as long as it's between parent and child).The supposed scientific accuracy was limited largely to the depiction of stellar lensing around the black hole and the silence of space. HowevvverWhy do pickup trucks look exactly the same in the future? Why is the dust all over the trucks and house but not the crops?That was the most ridiculous robot I've ever seen (I love the comment that it was made of ""spinning HVAC ducts""). How does this lurching refrigerator even get itself through a hatch? Its interface is a crude text screen worthy of a PCjr, yet it has a complete human personality (so much so that I had a hard time distinguishing its voice from the crew).Do you always launch your rockets from the middle of your office buildings? Remarkable how those glass partitions in view stood up to the blast.Apparently having no idea of what a wormhole is BEFORE being sent through one, Matthew is shown the rudimentary folded paper analogy. Wouldn't that have come up on the first day of class?How does a mile-high wave form out of foot-deep water?The planet orbits a black hole? Where's your light and heat coming from? Any problem with the intense X-rays usually found around these things? Guess not.On Matt Damon's planet, exactly why aren't the ""frozen clouds"" falling? At least Avatar posited superconducting rocks and intense magnetic fields to explain their floating mountains.When Matt takes Matthew out to show him the ""surface"", just how far do they walk? The rescue pilot flies at hundreds of miles an hour for at least a few minutes.When Cooper returns to our solar system, at least 60 years has elapsed since he received his daughter's video messages (since she is now in her 90s or more), so has Anne Hathaway been alone all that time on her planet? I don't recall any mention that she was going to be in a slow time region. By the way, time only slows down significantly in a very high gravitational field, which they showed no signs of being in.Besides all that and much more, the plot was disjointed, with inarticulate dialog and confusing placement of people. For example, during the entire scene of the boosted entry towards the black hole, I didn't know Cooper was in the shuttle, separated from Anne Hathaway in the station, until he looked across at her.It's not a completely terrible movie, there are some great visuals that are impressive in IMAX. But they're dragged down with the padding and cheap sentiment."
tt0120815,"I'm afraid that I hated every moment of this film. Spielburg overused emotional hokum to try to give his film wieght when we actually didn't care whether Private Ryan lived or died. The first twenty minutes, I accept are excellent, but they are just a rip off of someone else's hard work - and frankly I would rather see the original footage from the Second World War rather than the director's interpretation of it. Although it tried to be realistic and historical, it was neither. The history is faulty and the emotions of the rangers are not realistic. (I imagine that if it happened for real they would complain about having to rescue this mummie's boy and hide out somewhere safe until it was safe to go back to base.) I'd rather watch the notoriously bad, Objective Burma anyday. At least it doesn't pretend to be true."
tt0109830,"The main character is extremely optimistic, which makes me sad. It's a bad experience for me to watch the movie, I don't want to see it again and I'm sad about it."
tt0137523,"Superb, and truly one of the greatest movies of all time.It starts with the screenplay. Adapted from, and very faithful to, an excellent book. The book by Chuck Palahniuk was perfect for a movie: vivid, powerful, challenging, original, unpredictable. Considering how perfectly formed the book already was, the screenplay would have been a doddle.Some very interesting themes are explored - consumerism, class warfare, multiple-personality disorder, male bonding, terrorism and anarchy - without being judgemental.Direction is spot-on. Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are perfectly cast as the two lead characters, and deliver in spades. Helena Bonham Carter is a strange selection to take on the role of Marla, as she tends to act in Shakespearean dramas and other period pieces. However, despite this, her performance is very convincing.An absolute classic."
tt0133093,"The Matrix has an interesting plot, but overall, it is not the best movie. The dialogue is confusing. The romance is not romantic enough. I guess the special effects were slightly cool during that time. I do like the fashion, but wearing sunglasses all the time does not seem practical, especially if you're inside a building. Honestly, this is giving me philosophy on crack with a spice of action."
tt7286456,"Take a character that has been around for decades in print, and a few movies, throw away any bit of canon, force in a sub story that damages the image of a character (Thomas Wayne), and use all that to make a slow, depressing movie about mental health that would have made 1/20th of the gross if you hadn't thrown in the DC references, and you have ""Joker"""
tt0133093,"The directors of ""The Matrix"" mistake style for dark, depressing sets and gloomy-looking people uttering mumbo-jumbo about ""The One"". The film has an imaginative and wonderfully paranoid premise: What if the world we live in is not what we think it is, but an illusion created by malevolent beings. Unfortunately, we are subjected to stupid training segments for Reeves by the resistance (an ill-concieved concept all in its own), complete with an inane kickboxing sequence, in which the combatants fly through the air, impressing the half-wits in the audience, while we with IQ's over 50 just sit and yawn. The special  effects are more laughable than spectacular. Seeing a bullet fly by some guy in slow motion is certainly not amazing. The movie could have been so much better if it had had a better script, and omitted every scene ""outside reality"" I guess. All in all, this is science fiction for cavemen."
tt0468569,"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10."
tt0114369,"I notice this film is highly regarded by a lot of viewers. I, on the other hand, was not impressed with the story, pace, acting among these heavyweights or most anything else. I liked the little surprise ending - but I knew damn well that he was going to pull that trigger. Who wouldn't? It's just another serial killer flick, and not a very interesting one. Sorry."
tt1853728,"Have Tarantino's films always been this drab ? I used to get into the whole cool factor of Pulp and Jackie, but his latest offerings are simply embarrassing. His obsession with black people as always having to be empowered beacons of change of hope and change ? No, that happened a good while back. Most people just accept diversity and move on. His use of the same actors again and again might have been cute a few times, but now looks silly."
tt0114369,"I got bored watching this movie many times. BUT it also has some good moments. I'll breakdown both good and bad. Firstly, It's predictable. I predicted long before that Brad Pitt actors wife was gonna die. And when the box came I already knew the wife's head was in it. I just deduced it from the number of actors in the movie. Not many faces so it wasn't hard to deduce. So the ending was not a big shocking moment for me. There are many scenes in the movie which bore me. Like the dinner scene where the whole house starts shaking because of the subway. Totally useless scene. They start laughing crazily too and I didnt find that scene funny at all. There were many useless scenes like this. Where I felt bored. Felt like nothing was happening. There are some thriller scenes here and there. There were a couple of good scenes which I enjoyed. The scene where they try to enter the apartment and the killer starts shooting was amazing. Also the scene in the end when they are talking in the car with the killer, it has some amazing dialogue. That's the only part I liked about the movie. Overall I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. Slightly disappointed. If you are into mystery then you should watch Prisoners. It's a way better movie than this."
tt0137523,"My first instinct was to write some witty, over-used joke about the first rule, but then I realised that I actually had a decent chunk of serious things to say about this movie, so here we go. Speaking of the first rule, I just broke it.Fight Club is another one of those films that the so-called filmbros will tear you from limb to limb for not liking. Ever since its release, to say that it's built somewhat of a cult following is an understatement. It's been so ingrained in popular culture that even I've got to admit I made the ""first rule"" joke a couple of times before I had even watched it. And the problem is that ever since then, it's been worshipped as the epitome of filmmaking, the most profound commentary on culture, the greatest movie of all time, etc. Etc...Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Fight Club a lot. I've always been a fan of Fincher's, and this film, stylistically, is a beautifully gritty thriller, the kind that I've come to love. And it certainly deserves a lot of the praise that it gets. I don't think that it's the greatest movie in existence, but I did like watching it a lot. And a lot of the stuff that I'm about to say is going to make it sound like I hate this movie, and I don't. Fight Club is a good movie. However, I think that the biggest problem with this movie isn't the movie itself, but rather, the culture of people who have come to worship this movie like it's some sort of cinematic god. You know, those same people on Letterboxd and Instagram who think Parasite is an obscure foreign film and think that Joker is ""relatable"".And it's honestly kind of annoying that this perfectly great movie had been ruined by this filmbro culture, to the point when someone says it's their favourite movie your first thought is ""oh s**t"". And that's the thing - I have nothing against people who do say Fight Club is their favourite movie, but just because of that small percentage of people who are just... like that, your mind will automatically go RED FLAG even if it completely isn't. And it's almost ironic how this movie has been packaged and adored by the masses, adored for its anti-consumerist culture by the very consumerists that it criticises.I'm realising that this has veered away from being a review and is slowly turning into an essay about how much I hate filmbros, so let me just wrap it up with some final thoughts. I don't hate Fight Club, but I hate the people who have ruined it for people who genuinely like it.-Sasha."
tt0108052,This is one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen.
tt0110912,"Rating: 5.9Gonna get obliterated for this rating but I felt like I wasted my time. I get this movie was unorthodox to the movies coming out at the time with its non-linear narrative, gratuitous violence, down-to-earth dialogue, and absurd collection of plot points in act two we went from a boxing match to a gay BDSM chamber run by racists. But these alone didn't make it worthwhile. There are various interpretations about what the message of the movie is whether it's about seeking redemption like with Butch saving Marcellas, Jules leaving crime, etc., but it's not really about the message it's just pulp fiction: some raunchy stuff happening on a whim because life is not a linear sensical narrative with consistent uplifting messages. I didn't find the dialogue funny and I found a lot of the scenes nonsensical like how Butch decides to casually stroll into his apartment with no disguise and make breakfast while being hunted, and conveniently Vincent leaves his gun out in the open. If I wanted to see something with the spontaneity and pointlessness of life I'd just go outside. For me, this was disappointing."
tt0133093,"I really can't see what everyone thinks is so great about this movie, I think it is wildly over-rated. The special effects? Fore example the bullet scene: like another user said before me, it's slow-motion, and it's been around for a while! The bullets don't even look realistic at all. The other effects aren't that impressive especially not the robot guys that cut themselves into the ship in the end, they look awkwardly badly done, you can easily tell that they are CG. That Episode I lost all its Oscars to this movie is a big joke and it was sure as hell the last time I went up 3 in the morning (I live in Sweden, another time zone) just to see that lot of hypocrisy.I'm a big fan of (most) science-fiction movies and series, especially Star Wars but the plot in this one has too many obvious loose ends. ****possible spoilers ahead**** Humans to warm the earth? Yeah right umm, what about building a large battery and some kind of warmth generator instead? Or using less complicated minds like cows instead of humans then they wouldn't have to worry about that stupid matrix thing.The movie is also cluttered with clich√©s like ""There is no spoon"". Blah I got it that the matrix wasn't real the *first time* Morpheus *said* that to Neo. And also the ending is just plain stupid, sure love saves the day. That always works."
tt0114369,"Gothic, shocking, suspenseful, disturbing and clever, `Seven' marked a new beginning for director David Fincher's career. This dark tale of murder and crime revolves around two detectives in present New York city played by two brilliant actors `Brad Pitt' and `Morgan Freeman' who are paired together to solve a puzzle of murder that is at the hands of a man who kills regarding to the seven deadly sins. Both actors displayed striking performances that are so sharp and realistic sometimes you have to remind yourself that's its all acting.David Fincher's masterpiece really gives us an opportunity of a lifetime, maybe it's one that we don't all wish to share, but by seeing this movie you will experience a glimpse of the horrors that this world is filled with, and a small piece of mind of a man who you only prey you never have to meet.Brad Pitt successfully proves to us that he's not just a pretty face on screen, and that he sinks into his character so well, that you can walk off after the film finishes classifying him as a pretty darn good actor.You wouldn't expect anything else from Morgan Freeman because it's perfectly obvious that this guy was born to play the roles of the smart detective.David Fincher's timeless directing and memorable filming captures all the goods that this film has to offer and will undoubtedly leave you shocked and begging for more films like this. Seven is a step into the harsh realities of life, a realistic portrayal of two detectives investigation into the un-describable horrific world murder, and the darkest realms of the human soul.We can only prey for more classic memorable work from Mr. Fincher and for those future directors who are intent on making a gothic, psychological thriller, make sure you sit down and watch Seven with a pen and paper ready to take notes."
tt0167260,"Everything done throughout 3 massive movies could have easily been crammed into one single movie. I'll admit that the second part was slightly different but the third movie was pure, unrelenting garbage for the most part, simply because it had nothing new. I thought that the reason RoTK was so popular was because Sauron made a return and kicked everyone's ass and was the greatest villain every conceived. But the fact is that he does'nt even ever show up during the entire movie and remains nothing more than a virtual villain throughout the series. All you get to see is the stupidass eye of sauron. If thats what they were planning from the beginning, why the hell do they keep on and on going on about how evil and badass Sauron is? Can you imagine how Harry Potter would be if Voldemort never ever showed up during the entire series? The ending of the LoTR series is just predictable and nothing major happens. Ring falls into lava and everything goes back to normal. The reason this series is so popular is because Tolkien's fans enjoy seeing their readings transit into the cinematic experience. Otherwise, this is nothing but a large scale farce that has nothing new (wars, monsters, swords, medieval themes)."
tt0167261,"What a disappointment compared to FOTR.Too much of the film focuses on King Theoden, in which he is misinterpreted through constantly driveling, mamsy-pamsy lines.Too much of the film focuses on Eowyn, in which she is misinterpreted as a wallflower.Faramir's character is completely misinterpreted.  In the movie, he resembles his brother, not the cool, contemplative scholar/soldier nor the shadow of Aragorn as he was well delineated as being in the book.Though Gimli provides some much enriching comic relief; by the end of the film, you get the feeling that he is used solely for comic relief.Sure, all the visual craft is there. (Yea!) And Gollum's script and dramatic posturing are even more impressive than the masterful CGI rendering of him. (Yea!) The Ents are wonderfully captured. (Yea!) (Though the rescripting of their activities was another disappointment.)I could rationalize the plot changes in LOTR, but as I watched this film, I was rationalizing a lot.  My rationalizations stopped when the misinterpretation of Faramir, (and to a lesser extend) Theoden, and Eowen overwhelmed me into bitterness.I was expecting this trilogy to be one for the ages.  My expectations are shattered."
tt0172495,Ponderous. Historically in accurate. Poor character development. Sloppy direction to allow it to expand to 3! hours. Yeah might be worth watching but really overrated.
tt1345836,"To everyone who enjoyed the film, congratulations it's always nice to spend a few hours escaping from reality in the theatre.For those of us hoping the creators would build on the previous two films and complete a fine movie trilogy, sadly I left the theatre entirely underwhelmed. The movie was at best a video game with shallow characters and a boring story. At the 2 hour point I heard myself begging for the film to end but it would not.... for another 45 minutes!! How was I rewarded for remaining in my seat for nearly an hour? Batman takes a nuclear weapon out into the Atlantic (after wasting some of the precious last few seconds kissing Anne Hathaway and making Gary Oldman look a bit of a dill) where it explodes. The fact that a cloud of lethal radiation blown by onshore breezes to liquidate the cheering people of Gotham within a day annoyed me but not as much as Batman surviving the detonation!!! I was fine with them planting a headstone and delivering a eulogy but did they need to show him sipping a latte like smug a Goldman Sachs executive retired to the Riviera with their GFC bonus!! The most genuine and believable part of the film was Michael Caines resignation. When he sobbingly explains why he must leave because he can no longer stand by and watch everything he worked for and loves be destroyed in an act of selfish futility..... I couldn't help thinking he made the same speech in Chris Nolan's office! Compared to it's predecessors and the third installments of other film trilogies.... this was a very unsatisfying and poor film."
tt1375666,"And by deception rather than Inception I am referring to the title of this movie as although the film is good, it's far from brilliant and I have to say I left the cinema feeling rather deceived by all of the great reviews out there from the public and critics alike who had heralded this flick a masterpiece. But a masterpiece it is not. In fact, it's rather derivative from other films Christopher Nolan has directed, including Memento and The Prestige, with shades of 2001 A Space Odyssey permeating the picture as well. Now DiCaprio, of course is mesmerising as always, yet he doesn't really have a lot to do as he mopes about missing his children without really expressing the distress he feels to the audience very well. Sure he anchors in the film, and in a very subtle way, but to subtle for me - almost boring subtle, which really griped me as I prefer his more flamboyant and boisterous roles. Roles he has played in films such as Shutter Island and Blood Diamond really allow him to work those acting chops of his and usually make for a very entertaining film. This film just didn't let him do that.The film, although visually superior to most others out there on the market today, left me with a feeling of boredom at times and by the end I felt the pay off I had been desperately waiting for didn't arrive and instead of sharing the elation of the critics and audience alike I was left with a ""O my God, was that it"" replaying in my mind.So my advice...watch this film by all means, but be warned, that although it is at times intriguing and thought provoking most of the time it's meandering, plodding and ultimately quite pointless. Good but not that good. 6/10 (3*)"
tt0372784,"Set in the fictional city of Gotham, Batman Begins tells the story of how Bruce Wayne became what he was destined to be. Jumping between Bruce's child-hood to his adult life, then to present time, this movie shows what influences and experiences affected his decision to become the Dark Knight of Gotham, a story which a lot of people don't know. This movie is for anybody who's ever wondered ""Hey, how did this bat guy get to be so good at man to man combat? Or, where did he get all those gadgets and that bat mobile? Or, why did this guy just decide to dress up and fight crime? Or even, why choose a bat?""Now, not being a huge fan of the Batman franchise (especially in the last 10 years) and even knowing that Christopher Nolan was directing, I didn't expect much from this movie. I was thinking to myself ""Oh brilliant! Another Batman movie, another weak idea for a comic book movie, another excuse to make a high budget movie jammed with loads of CGI and explosions. How could anybody possible think they would be able to milk anything new and unique out of a franchise that has been squeezed dry by almost every star of Hollywood and still hasn't had any real success?"" Very open minded I know, but how could you not be skeptical?However, I was most pleasantly surprised. Unlike your typical comic book movie, Batman Begins avoids the temptation to include those cheesy awkward moments and one liners that make you nauseous. But, this movie was anything but typical; it was the most original and down to earth comic book adaptation in years. The storyline actually made sense and was believable, unlike the other movies, it never leaves you thinking ""But why was he¬Ö or But how can he¬Ö"" The acting was convincing, Christian Bale had just the right persona to give the effect of a man with a lot on his mind and a lot bottled up inside him. Morgan Freeman was his calm, cool, collected (and very smooth) self. Michael Caine did a good job in his type-cast role as Alfred the butler, and Katie Holmes' performance was better than expected. However, the most refreshing and skilled new actor in this movie, in my opinion, was Cillian Murphy in his role of Dr. Jonathan Crane, who seemed to be the wild card of the cast as he was the only actor who has previously only had cameo roles in films ¬ñ but he did an astounding job of his role. I am positive we will be seeing much more of him in the future. The directing was superb; the use of lighting and camera angles really gave Gotham that gloomy and dark feel about it. The moral of the film: We fall down so we can pick ourselves up again seemed completely valid in any context and was completely relevant in the film. But the best part was¬Ö No nipples on the bat suit!Unlike previous installments in the Batman franchise, this is not a kid's movie. It is darker, deeper and more down to earth than all the rest. But it is welcomed by me and I'm sure the majority of the people in this large, movie loving world.Overall I would give this movie 8 out of 10 stars, because at the end of the day, a superhero movie can only be so good. But it is great cinema and it is wished that skeptics (as I was), may give this film a chance."
tt1345836,"Hype can kill a movie, and I think the fanboys can't handle the fact that this film isn't the cinematic masterpiece it was made out to be. Therefore, they still give the film 10/10 because they can't accept failure. I think this Avengers vs. TDKR crap has really riled them up (note, I am NOT an Avengers fanboy). Ever since the release of The Dark Knight, there have been a new legion of insane fanboys and they outnumber everyone. They are always right, we are wrong. But hey, TDKR is amazing because it's supposed to be, right? Wrong.Let's discuss the film at hand. It's called The Dark Knight Rises which is a stupid name for a movie. Let's discuss how dumb this movie is.John Blake randomly figures out Batman's identity. So according to Blake's logic, every orphan knows who Batman is. Give me a break.The nuclear reactor changes into a bomb in a few minutes. Do some research, this is impossible. It's also funny how it has a LED display. LOL.So, Bruce Wayne falls in love with Selina Kyle after she steals his mother's necklace, steals his car, and then sets him up against Bane which resulted in his back being broken. Explain, why does Bruce love/trust her after all that? It makes no sense. And why does Catwoman randomly change from bad to good? No explanation, which shows the laziness of the screenwriters.The prison Bruce is sent to has a way to escape with no guards. What a weak plot device. You'd think Bane would leave some of his men there just to make sure nothing goes wrong. I mean, he obviously knows people can escape. And plus there is a rope Bruce throws down after he leaves. Couldn't any average Joe just walk up there and throw the rope down? Come on Bane... I thought you were smarter than this!How did Bruce make that jump with an injured knee? No explanation. Lazy screen writing.If you do your research, you will learn that Bruce magically healing his back like that is impossible. More lazy screen writing.Why did Talia wait so long to blow Gotham up? Why not do it right when Batman returns, right when the people regain hope? But she waits, and waits, and waits... also got to love her Razzie worthy death scene.Funny how Batman stands around listening to Talia's final speech when there is a bomb about to blow up the city!Batman gets stabbed but he's OK... because he's Batman.Uhm, why didn't Batman use any gadgets against Bane in the first fight? Well, he used those lame firecrackers, but you're telling me he doesn't have anything better? Seriously.Catwoman possesses the ability to magically appear wherever she needs to be. Kind of like the Joker. It's a pretty cool super-power.The writers couldn't think of anything more original than a bomb timed to blow up a city? Like that hasn't been used before. What a shame that this final film resorts to using so many clich√©s.TDKR is a fat ripoff of THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, which is a James Bond film. More lazy screen writing.Uh, Bane and his minions magically get motorcycles after the Stock Exchange heist.Day randomly changes to night.Poorly choreographed fight scenes (Nolan is TERRIBLE at shooting action).How about sending almost all of Gotham's police force in the sewers to get Bane? Please explain to me what makes sense about that.Yeah, this film is unrealistic garbage and is an insult to film lovers. If you like clich√©s, hectic pacing, plot holes, forced romances, cheesy dialogue, and lame action scenes, then this film is for you!"
tt1345836,"In 2005 Christian Bale became Batman. Seven years later Christopher Nolan's wonderful depiction of the caped crusader came to an end. For people who have loved the first two movies in the series, The Dark Knight Rises does not disappoint.First of all, you are drawn in from the very beginning with the music thanks to the magnificent Hans Zimmer. Nolan clearly budgeted a lot of money towards the special effects used throughout the film and there are plenty to be amazed by without them feeling forced.The cast chemistry was amazing. Christian Bale for the first time was overpowered by an adversary (Bane) and had to once again find himself. This let Bale have more time to give us a quality portrayal of Bruce Wayne. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman stuck true to their characters, where newcomer to Gotham, Anne Hathaway, gave a good performance as the cat burglar Selina Kyle. The best performance of the movie, however, came from Joesph Gordon-Levitt. His portrayal of an incorruptible cop got plenty of screen time and blended perfectly with the film.Overall Nolan's vision of Batman is by far the best Batman of all time. The trilogy itself is a contended for best trilogy of all time in any genre. It is hard to complain about this film, but there were two small things I thought could have been improved.I thought Nolan's Bane was a rich, complex character. I understood the need for the face mask, but it was hard as a viewer to understand what he was saying. I felt like he had some amazing lines, but sometimes I simply could not make them out. I also felt he deserved a better death, a more noble death for such a true character.And secondly although Michael Caine's emotional performance was perfect I would have liked to see him a little more and have more award winning dialogue.Overall The Dark Knight Rises is still the best film I have seen in a years. The journey Nolan has been able to take us on shows what everyone wants to see. Someone to rise up and protect those who need protecting. I fully expect Oscar nominations from special effects all the way to movie of the year. If TDKR doesn't win best film of the year I think it is safe to say that no comic book adaption ever will."
tt0697783,"What an entertaining episode. Four great story lines and a swell pace.Although there are four stories, only three of them interconnect with each other. As you may have guessed, Kramer is the one set apart. Nevertheless his story is quite entertaining even if the good stuff only appears in the end. From the moment he goes to the AIDS walk everything clicks. Bob and Cedric make another stellar appearance and we get a hilarious, though pretty fantastical, scene concerning Kramer and his non-ribbon attitude.But the great part of this episode is the other three stories. Although they interconnect with each other beautifully, they all are strong individually. Jerry is dating a woman that's too good for him, George is dealing with the no-secret Susan's policy and Elaine is surviving the sponge hiatus. The season's arc gets a key aspect in the long term relationship book and that is no matter what's the topic, you have to share with your wife. Elaine shines in her quest for sponges and the subsequent analysis for using them.A great episode all in all."
tt0167260,"Peter Jackson has done it.  He has created an all-encompassing epic saga of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books, and after coming away from the final chapter, how does this rate not only as a film on its own, but as a part of the whole?Perfect.I've never seen a series like this.  A trilogy of movies created with such love and care and utter perfection of craft that you can't help but walk away and wonder how did Peter Jackson make this possible?  I have always loved the original ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"" series for their epic storytelling, and just for just fitting in as a great moment in cinema. This should be, will be, remembered with as much revered fondness for generations to come.  They do not make films like these anymore.As a stand alone film, it picks up immediately where ""Two Towers"" ends, so brush up before seeing it.  I've read the books, and the anticipation of seeing some of the more profound moments in this film made me kind of view it with a rushed sense of perspective.  I wanted to make sure everything in this film was done ""right"".  And when it happened, it was.  I will need to see this again to enjoy everything on a more casual level.The cast comes through once more.  The musical score retains its beauty, elegance and power.  The special effects, notably Gollum again, are nothing less than breathtaking, and simply move the story along.  The battles are monumentally huge and exciting.  There are some liberties taken with the story, especially during the end with the homecoming, and yet, everything that needed to be covered regarding the main characters was handled. After the greatest moment of the series resolves itself, the story provided a breather.  And gives a good-bye to friends seen on screen for the last three years.  It was truly a bittersweet feeling in realizing that there will be no ""Rings"" movie in 2004.  I will miss this talented group of actors.As with the first two, the film is very long, but goes by without you ever truly realizing it.  This film is so much more than a simple ""fantasy"" epic. It's a story about strength of character, friendship, loyalty and love. And while every member of the Fellowship has their part to play, I finally understood why some critics have said this series is a story about Sam. It's his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory.  Sean Astin is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic.  As as far as the ending goes, they ended it the way that it had to be ended. Jackson ended this film the way it should have been.I will miss looking forward to a new ""Rings"" movie, but these movies provide hope that high-quality films can still be made without special effects taking over a story, bathroom humor, or a ""Top 40"" soundtrack.  George Lucas could learn a lot from these films about how not to alienate the fanbase.Each film has earned a ""10"" from me for the last two years, which for me to give is a rarity.  This one, however, is as equally deserving as its two predecessors.  The Academy had better not look over this film for ""Best Picture"" of 2003.  To do so would be greatly disrespectful of the craft and care that anyone involved with these films put into them."
tt0993846,"Scorsese and DiCaprio's fifth venture together, this might be their most mainstream attempt till now. This black-hearted comedy, filled with colour, glamour, parties, money, corruption, drugs and sex, oozes of energy throughout it's three-hour long run-time. I admit it's a fun-filled ride throughout, and it never gets boring. But after a certain point, the narration, the jokes and the parties get monotonous. For such a long movie, the character-development and character-exploration is very poor, and there are so many characters and scenes which don't have any special relevance or importance in the whole story being told. I can't believe it's Terence Winter (from 'The Sopranos' and 'Boardwalk Empire') who wrote the script. The main distraction while watching a biopic like this is that the things shown on screen (fabulous office parties, amount of drugs each of the them take within a day, their ability to function properly in such high, the money lavishly spent around, and so many other things) always make you wonder how much of it is accurate and how much of it is complete exaggeration; you don't get a clear picture of the people and lifestyle of that place and era.But whatever you say, with whatever is given to him, Leonardo audaciously gets into the skin of the character and is fascinating to watch. Moira MacDonald from Seattle Times aptly says, ""DiCaprio is positively reptilian; he spits out his lines with a nasty glee. You're both horrified and enchanted by this creature - a monster in Armani"". And Jonah Hill is almost as integral to the movie as DiCaprio himself; he's hilariously terrific from beginning till end.I like that the movie doesn't shy away from being filthy. Plus Scorsese's depiction of a modern tragedy as an epic farce works to its advantage. Looks like Scorsese was in quite a fun mood or pretty high (like the movie's characters) while making this. Though it's a hysterical and thoroughly-entertaining journey, I still don't understand why Scorsese and DiCaprio jumped into making this completely exaggerated alleged life of a convicted swindler. Anyway, the feature is good not great. With a little more depth, the movie could have been timeless."
tt0993846,"I think this is a very well crafted movie. The performances are excellent and the director and all his staff made a wonderful job. And this has the best dialog I have heard in years - despite the frequent f-words. Yes, this is one of the rags-to-riches-and-then-to-jail -movie. But somehow I missed the larger-in-life -character Gordon Gekko, who has already become a living legend although he is only a fiction from Stone's Wall Street. The main character is just a brat with addictions: drug, sex and money. Like a teenager-for-ever -type. He never grows and he never learns. At the end he is still making money for himself and some avid listeners. I hope his methods are legitimate now. But there is virtually no reference to the outside world. No political or philosophical connotations. And during this time inside Wall street was happening a lot! Later we found out what... So my only complaint is that this movie tries to be a Novel (apparently Epic Novel for 3 hours!)but manages in only being a short story."
tt0108052,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people."""
tt1853728,"I loved Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction. They had good humour, great action scenes and generally great plot.That's why I watched both of these movies. The difference is, unlike Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, these movies are based on slavery and holocaust. It is probably to gain love in Jewish and Black communities, but it just turns the movies sour.You probably all know why inglorious bastards sucked, there was not so good casting. The bad guys were just bad guys and good guys thought that killing bad guys was the only option. There was no in-depth plot. Although, I must admit that the German guy that is at the beginning and at the end is a very interesting character.As to Django, again, we get a very good performance from the 'bad guy' in this case Leonardo Di Caprio. As to the main characters they are just too plain, there is an ambition to have a very good performance for the German guy, but whoever the actor is certainly does not deliver. As to Jamie Foxx, he is OK, but his character is pretty weird.And most importantly, all these stupid 1 vs 40 fights that end with 40 guys dead are just inconceivable.I know that this movie received very good reviews, but I guess that is because nobody wanted to review a big budget movie against slave owners badly, just like nobody wanted to review a big budget movie against Hitler badly."
tt0397103,"I just purchased this movie because I love to donate to Operation Smile, the charity on which the movie was based...but I found the writing of the movie to be very strange. It t does not really focus so much on Operation Smile or similar organizations like The Smile Train and their Herculean efforts to relieve the suffering of children born with facial deformities in third world countries. No, it concentrates on an American teenage volunteer, Katie, whose ""over-privileged"" life in Malibu, California, includes a mother who brings her to a doctor so that she'll have birth control pills in her before she sleeps with her boyfriend. What is this birth control nonsense supposed to do, titillate the audience? It's 2005. I'd be more surprised if in 2005 a Malibu teen wasn't on birth control, and even if she is, so what and who cares? Contrasting Katie is the character of Lin in China, a girl with a facial deformity who missed last year's chance to get an operation and this year does not want to have one. Neither character is written in such a way that the audience can really identify with, let alone understand the motivations of, either girl. On the other hand, the actors do an adequate job of trying to play the bad hand they were dealt by whoever wrote this ridiculous script. The best performance was by the gentleman playing Lin's father although much of his dialogue is in Chinese and subtitled. Operation Smile deserved to be honored by a much better movie than this!"
tt0133093,"Right there with Seven and Silence of the Lambs for me.  I love this film, and rate it a notch above some of the other great action films of our time (i.e., Terminator, Predator) because it has a really well thought out (although moderately unbelievable) story line.  A lot of thought provoking material, and some interesting subtleties. I've seen it 10 times (I don't usually watch a movie more than once), and I'll watch it a few more. Enjoy!"
tt0468569,"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all  of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael  Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress""  stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins""  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The  action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud  Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who  sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing  in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may  feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I  will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a  human being and father to his daughter Matilda  Ledger.

tt0137523,"Fight Club is like Shrek. And Shrek is like onions. And onions have layers. Therefore; Fight Club has layers. Many of them. Because of this I do feel it's a movie that needs repeat viewing in order to appreciate it more.Fight Club makes interesting and very relatable statements against the current consumer-driven materialistic society (which has only gotten worse since the film's release.) Very stylish and sophisticated, the film features some hilarious and inventive ways of breaking the fourth wall and hitting you with subliminal messages. The famous twist ending remains one of the wackiest in recent memory and performances across the part are perfect.It's one of those movies where you notice something new about it each time you see it, whether it be a split second shot of a dong or a single line of dialogue that makes you ponder on the emptiness of your existence. The cinematography is outstanding and really adds to the nihilistic tone of the movie. Overall, the film is about a great many things: manliness, materialism, generation X and Y's place in the world, life's little ironies, the oddity of western civilisation and, of course, fighting. But we can't talk about that.Best Scene: Hmmm, picking one is difficult because I felt that the film flowed in such a way that it didn't feel like a movie where one scene follows another and instead worked as a whole. I'll pick the part where Edward Norton beats the crap out of himself and blames his boss."
tt0120815,"The 1998 movie ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the all-time great war movies. While much of the movie is a fictional account, the premise behind Capt. Miller's mission is based on a true story. That is the story of the Niland brothers - Edward, Preston, Robert, and Frederick - from Tonawanda, New York.The two middle brothers, Preston and Robert, had enlisted prior to the beginning of the War. After America entered the war the oldest, Edward, and youngest, Frederick, known as Fritz to his friends, joined up in November 1942. Because of the tragedy of the Sullivan brothers aboard the USS Juneau earlier that year, the brothers were split up and sent to different units around the Army. Edward became an enlisted pilot, with the rank of Technical Sergeant, of a B-25 Mitchell bomber flying in the Burma-India-China theatre. Preston was commissioned into the infantry and assigned to Company C, 22nd Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division. Robert and Fritz both became paratroopers. Robert served with Company D, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division. Fritz joined Company H, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division. U.S. Army paratroopers are dropped near Grave, Netherlands while livestock graze near gliders that landed earlier. This was the beginning of Operation Market Garden during World War II, which resulted in heavy Allied losses. As fate would have it, three of the brothers found themselves preparing for the invasion of mainland Europe.However, before the brothers could start their ""Great Crusade"" to liberate Europe, Edward was shot down somewhere over Burma. He was listed as Missing in Action, but this usually carried a presumption of death at the time, especially if he had fallen into the hands of the Japanese. Then, in the early morning hours of June 6, 1944, Robert and Fritz joined over 23,000 Allied paratroopers in cracking Fortress Europe. Although Fritz's unit, 3rd Battalion, 501st PIR, was supposed to be the division reserve, the misdrops meant they were thrust into action in ad hoc groups. These forces were able to secure vital causeways, bridges, and locks allowing the 4th Infantry Division, and Niland brother Preston, to exit Utah beach later that day. U.S. Soldiers of the 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, move out over the seawall on Utah Beach after coming ashore. Other troops are resting behind the concrete wall. Elsewhere, Robert Niland had landed outside of Ste. Mere-Eglise with the rest of the 505th as part of Mission Boston. After the 3rd Battalion was able to capture the town early in the morning, the 2ndBattalion linked up with it to establish a defensive perimeter. When a strong German counter-attack came from the south, Robert Niland and the rest of D Company's 3rd platoon were left to guard the northern approaches to the town in a small village called Neuville. When two companies of Germans came at their position, they fought tenaciously to hold them off to buy time for their comrades to the south. When the position became untenable, Robert Niland, along with two other paratroopers, volunteered to stay behind and cover the platoon's retreat toward Ste. Mere-Eglise.While manning a machine gun in the face of the German onslaught, Robert Niland was killed in action. That very same morning, Lt. Preston Niland led his men onto the shores of Utah beach as part of the seaborne invasion of Normandy. Though casualties were relatively light for the men of the 4th Infantry Division on Utah beach, the battles beyond would be much tougher. Despite having made if off the beaches, the men of the 4th Infantry Division still had numerous gun batteries of Hitler's Atlantic Wall to clear. The task of capturing the Crisbecq battery, which had already sunk the destroyer USS Corry, fell to Lt. Niland and his men. On June 7, Niland led his men against the German position. During the heavy fighting Niland fell mortally wounded. The rest of his unit was repulsed. The battery would not fall until several days later to units of the 9th Infantry Division. The Niland brothers' parents received all three notifications in a very short amount of time. Their only condolence was a letter from Fritz informing them that ""Dad's Spanish-American War stories are going to have to take a backseat when I get home. ""Fritz was unaware of the fate of his brothers. When the War Department received word of the tragedy orders were dispatched to return Fritz Niland to the United States. That task fell to the regimental Chaplin, Father Francis Sampson. Sampson located Fritz, who had been searching for his brother in the 82nd and began to paperwork to send him home. Returning to the United States in 1944, Fritz served for the remainder of the war as an MP in New York.This article was written by James Elphick and originally appeared on WeAreTheMighty.com"

tt0361748,"Inglourious Basterds is Quentin Tarrantino's homage to the entertaining World War II action films of the 60s and 70s. Of all such films, 'Basterds' mostly resembles the highly entertaining ""The Dirty Dozen"". In 'Chapter 1' (unquestionably the best scene in the movie), Tarrantino raises his 'Dirty Dozen' to a higher plane. In his World War II epic, the Nazis' hatred of the Jews is not ignored (unlike these earlier action films). At the outset, Tarrantino's SS man, Landa, is wholly believable as the charming sadist who ends up murdering a Jewish family hidden under the floorboards of a French dairy farmer's home. Like many of the scenes in the film, the opening scene is dialogue heavy but the tension is so palpable that one sits engrossed until the scene's brutal and harrowing outcome.The reason why 'The Dirty Dozen' was so entertaining was that each convict 'misfit' had a distinct and extremely interesting personality. Tarrantino doesn't bother to develop any of his basterds as fleshed out people. Instead, all they can do is scalp Nazis or as one of them does (the so-called 'Bear Jew') beats Nazi brains out with a baseball bat. What's more, Tarrantino doesn't bother showing how they develop as a team and how they overcome obstacles leading to their reputation as professional killers. Instead, they're plopped down in occupied France and meet no real resistance. The whole charm of 'The Dirty Dozen' was that that they had to overcome not only the external obstacles of fighting the Nazis but deal with their own internal strife. In short, they were fairly plausible, believable characters. Not so with Tarrantino's group who are not only unbelievable but unsympathetic (they're as sadistic as their Nazi opponents).The problem with Tarrantino's narrative is that it gradually becomes more and more implausible and incoherent. I was willing to suspend my disbelief when Shoshanna, the Jewish girl, escapes while Landa murders her family (did his gun jam?) but how does she become the owner of a movie theater a few years later? Wouldn't the Nazis have uncovered her Jewish heritage? Tarrantino's portrait of Goebbals as a dilettante in the world of German cinema rang true but I question the assertion that he was the #2 man (next to Hitler) in the Nazi hierarchy (certainly Bormann, Heydrich and Goring had a lot more power).Visually, it was a nice touch in showing Hitler with an unflattering complexion as well as making fun of his out of control temper; but to reduce Hitler to a complete buffoon while other Nazi characters are quite believably scary, makes no sense whatsoever. Hitler, after all, was the brains behind the operation.Tarrantino does serve up some juicy characters which were highly entertaining. I liked Pvt. Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) as he first appears to be a harmless, lovesick puppy dog, enamored with our Jewish cinema owner and actually exudes modesty despite having become a war hero and accidental movie star. And it makes perfect sense for him to morph into a sadistic stalker on the verge of rape when he shows his 'true colors' after confronting Shoshanna in the projection booth. In some ways, Zoller is more sinister than Landa.Kudos also to Diane Kruger as Bridget Hammersmark, the movie actress who's also a double agent. Despite its unpleasantness, the scene of Kruger's demise at the hands of the sadistic Landa pulls you in. Perhaps the best character in the movie is Major Dieter Hellstrom, played by the brilliant August Diehl, who ends up exposing Michael Fassbender's film critic turned spy in the basement tavern face-off. The way Tarrantino has the diabolical Major deduce it's 'King Kong' during the card game is utterly brilliant. Through Hellstrom's 'deduction', Tarrantino demonstrates that he has a profound understanding of the sinister nature of Nazi politics and ideology.Tarrantino, however, shoots himself in the foot in the final third of the movie. The Basterds are supposed to be a crackerjack professional outfit but allow themselves to be easily apprehended at the film premiere because no one speaks any languages except English. And despite Hitler showing up at the premiere, there's absolutely no security (Shoshanna's black lover who plans to set fire to the building has free rein to walk around without being stopped once). In Tarrantino's warped universe, he somehow feels some kind of perverse satisfaction in having Shoshanna laugh at the Nazis as they are being burned to a crisp in an on screen rant.Finally, what really killed the film for me was the denouement where the sinister and charming Landa suddenly becomes a blithering idiot by offering to surrender to the Allies after allowing the Basterds' bomb plot to proceed. How could the ""Hangman"" of Occupied France suddenly deceive himself into believing that Lt. Aldo Raine, the notorious Nazi killer, would agree to his ludicrous demands and then keep his word?Inglorious Basterds contains a plethora of clever references to the history of cinema. Many of the scenes are overlong and talky but the dialogue is always crisp and never boring. Tarrantino's characters are a mixed bag‚Äîhe's much more successful with his Nazi antagonists than his American protagonists. Particularly disappointing is Brad Pitt who has little to do except practice a Southern accent. With the exception of Hitler and SS Landa's final scenes, Tarrantino does a credible job of humanizing his Nazis. That doesn't mean he approves of them but it shows he knows what makes them tick.Tarrantino should have consulted with Daniel Mendelsohn before making his mad revenge fantasy. Mendelsohn, writing in Newsweek, gets it right: ""An alternative, and morally superior, form of ""revenge"" for Jews would be to do precisely what Jews have been doing since World War II ended: that is, to preserve and perpetuate the memory of the destruction that was visited upon them, precisely in order to help prevent the recurrence of such mass horrors in the future."""
tt0120737,"In twenty years, everybody will more or less agree that this was just a fairly unimaginative and clumsy b-movie, despite all the fuss and all the special effects that looked so nice back then.Tolkien's book is not flawless, but whether you happen to be a fan of the original or not, Jackson's movie fails as a based-on-a-book work: it is neither faithful enough or independent enough to justify itself. Even worse, it tries so hard to be something grand that it also fails to be a simple but entertaining adventure film.If there's one thing this movie should be remembered for in the history of cinema, it is the strong influence it had on the emerging tradition of using loud noises and spook visuals to build tension instead of resorting to decent scriptwriting, acting and directing."
tt0172495,"""Gladiator"" is a movie with a lot going for it.  A big budget, a big director, an up and coming star, a summer release date, etc, etc.  But in my opinion, it falls just short.  Despite what you may have heard, this movie is predictable, slow, and corny.  The fight scenes themselves are stellar, even fantastic, but they are few and far between.  The majority of this movie deals with a whiny Joaquin Phoenix and his incestuous lusts and obvious motives.  Russell Crowe does well with what he's given, but most of the best scenes involving him involve so much CG background and action that it ends up taking away from the acting, as was evident in another so called summer blockbuster ""The Phantom Menace.""  The violence is overboard and gratuitous and the movie moves like molasses.  Overall, I say thumbs down.  Give me real action over CG action any day of the week."
tt0816692,"There's a lot to like in this film. The way it uses real and theoretical science, the way it doesn't pander to the Star Wars fans by showing space as it is, a soundless void. There's a great deal of thought surrounding communication across time. Ultimately though the film is flawed in many ways. Let me list them: 1/ The idea that food crops are failing across the world and yet people are shown still eating wholesome meals...there is still gas for the cars and power stations still work is somewhat incongruous to me.2/ Matthew McConaughey is just not the right person to have played the lead role. He seems too laconic and the way he mumbled his dialogue at times was downright annoying.3/ I don't think the US would allow school books to be printed saying that the moon landings were a hoax designed to bankrupt Russia. Political correctness, I suppose, will probably become more intrusive in the future...but THAT intrusive? 4/ The ""incident"" with Matt Damon (""Dr. Mann"") is just ridiculous and muddies the storyline and the pace of the film.5/ The robot design is so impractical as to be laughable. Even the B9 robot from the old TV show ""Lost in Space"" would have worked better.6/ Will Hollywood PLEASE pension off Mr. Zimmer and his theme-less exercises in going up and down the music scales to generate tension. Much of the ""music"" was loud and not appropriate to scene and there really was no memorable theme at all. Goldsmith would be turning in his grave! I congratulate the Nolans for trying to make an intelligent SciFi film in these times of dross. They have succeeded in many ways but the film is not the masterpiece 2001 is."
tt0068646,"I finally got a chance to see this movie. I tried to watch it with an open mind, without letting the hype dilute an even slight bit of impartiality - and I just can't say it's a very good movie. Perchance if soap opera was its own category, this may stand true to its title as ""#1"" on the IMDb.It perplexes me how people can call this landmark moviemaking when they probably have not seen works from other directors - Kurosawa, Truffaut, Lang... - all of whom had a much better eye than Coppolla. Most of these greats are now forgotten, with the exceptions of occasional screenings at film schools where one discovers that the Contemporary filmmaking style overseas  (1950s and 1960s)  was duplicated by American directors in the 1970s.So what was wrong with this movie? Nonexistent or loose plot: No suspense, climax, excitement, or outcome. I thought the acting/characters were forgettable. Any other actor could have pulled off what Brando did and the fact they went through all that trouble to make him 10 or 20 year older just proves they shot for name recognition.There were only a few things that I remember in this 3 hours of triviality: the ""offer you can't refuse"" line, Don Vito collapsing in a garden while a child obliviously plays, Caan's Santino character getting holed up, and bullets consistently going into foreheads. Maybe the artful yet repellent depiction of gratuitous violence is what made this such a masterpiece. But style without substance does not a good movie make.For those who say ""oh, you just didn't get it, see it again"", please get your mind out of the gutter - stop basing your opinions on what you're conditioned to like.The Emperor's New Clothes, big time. End of review."
tt0108052,Boring. Wasted my time on this movie. Dissatisfied.
tt0468569,"I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.*Runs*The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it?We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reason¬óbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips?Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the ""yang"" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the ""yin""; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them¬Ö) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven."
tt0133093,"In the late 90s, summer blockbusters were really suffering quality. There were films like Godzilla, Armageddon, deep impact etc. Point is that these summer blockbuster movies only focused on special effects due to the groundbreaking effects of Jurassic Park, and forgot to give us engaging stories and compelling characters, which became tiresome. In 1999, the matrix was released and blew everyone's mind. The audience were talking about how deep and philosophical, cerebral film it is, something new and innovative. But is it really that? The answer is, to be honest, no.The idea of a society that realize their reality is an illusion and have to fight authorities is not really new. It has been done in TV episodes, satire, books and many other medium. In fact, even anime did that idea before, just 4 years prior (ghost in the shell). The film is very much outdated, silly, pretentious and not as smart as the movie thinks it is.There are major problems with the movie, particularly the characters. The characters are so dull, uninteresting and bland that it is so hard to get invested in them. Morpheus is your typical mentor figure, Trinity is a boring character, with so little expressions to show and have zero chemistry with Neo, the main character. There is no reason for her to be in love with him. There has not been a single scene which indicates they should be together. And as for Neo, he is as interesting as a plank of wood, having almost no personality, poor facial expressions. And to top it off, there hasn't been a solid proof why he is ""the one"". There isn't anything special about him, he doesn't have any leadership skills, he doesn't even know what AI is or what EMP stands for.There is also another major problem. And it's a huge plot hole in the film. Why is there a matrix? Why is this system needed? The humans are planted, so why need to give them a matrix? All they need to do is just find a way to keep the human energy alive. The film is so pretentious, and has this confidence that is smart, but has one of the most cop out endings in a blockbuster movie. Trinity saves Neo with the power of love. How is something like that left in a ""cerebral"", ""philosophical"" movie, when it has an ending that belongs in fairy tales? It's stupid, forced and doesn't add up.So for all the rant this review has, is the film terrible? Not quite. In fact, it's a decent movie with some clever ideas and analogies, and props for having a major impact on film making and actually trying to do something different in the action genre as well as blockbuster movies, but it's not really the masterpiece it is claimed to be. It's outdated and is deeply flawed. But to some extent, it is understandable why many people love it."
tt0167260,"I am, I admit, an unlikely convert to the religion of Tolkienism. I  have never read the books, having, I thought, been put off them for  life by the sort of obsessive freaks who read them when I was at  school. (One classmate, then aged about sixteen, told me with great  pride that he had read the whole of 'The Lord of the Rings' at least  fifty times). I also have never been a great admirer of the 'sword and  sorcery' school of fantasy writing or film-making; indeed, some of this  genre (mostly those starring the current governor of California) struck  me as being among the worst films ever made.  I was, however, persuaded to see the first in the trilogy, 'The  Fellowship of the Ring', by its overwhelmingly positive reception from  the critics, and was quickly won over by the scope of Peter Jackson's  vision. I had been expecting some twee tale of elves, gnomes and  fairies; what I experienced was a genuine epic (in the true sense of  that overused word). Ever since December 2001, I have been waiting for  parts two and three of the trilogy to be released. Neither has  disappointed me.  The story of 'The Lord of the Rings' is too complex to be told in a  review such as this. Suffice it to say that it revolves around a magic  ring which will give its possessor immense power. The power-hungry Dark  Lord Sauron (a figure who is never actually seen on screen) desires to  obtain the ring in order to dominate Middle Earth. His enemies, led by  the wizard Gandalf, are seeking to destroy the ring, which can only be  used for evil purposes, not for good. At the beginning of the final  part of the trilogy, Sauron's forces are massing for an attack on the  kingdom of Gondor.  The film relates the story of the conflict which follows, and this  leads to some of the most spectacular battle sequences I have seen,  even more impressive than those in 'The Two Towers'. Inevitably, the  film makes much use of computer-generated effects, but unlike many  films dominated by special effects, plot and character are not  neglected. The acting is uniformly good, and in some cases outstanding.  Special mentions must also go to the camera-work, which made the best  possible use of the magnificent New Zealand scenery, and to Howard  Shore's memorable musical score.  So, looking forward to the Oscar ceremony, I have no doubt that this  should be the best film and that Peter Jackson, who has amply fulfilled  the promise shown in the excellent 'Heavenly Creatures', should be best  director. Best Actor? I would find it difficult to decide between the  competing claims of Sir Ian McKellen, who brings wisdom, kindliness and  the required touch of steel to his portrait of Gandalf, and of Elijah  Wood, who plays the brave and resourceful hobbit Frodo to whom falls  the dangerous task of ensuring the ring's destruction. Best Supporting  Actor? My own nomination would be for Sean Astin, as Frodo's loyal  companion Sam, but several others might have claims, notably Viggo  Mortensen or Bernard Hill.  Is this the best movie ever made, as some of its admirers have claimed?  Possibly not- that is, after all, a very large claim to make. I have no  doubt, however, that the trilogy as a whole is the first great  cinematic masterpiece of the twenty-first century. It has certainly  inspired me to start reading Tolkien's original novels. 10/10."
tt0120815,"Yes, the opening sequence is breathtaking.  Once it's over with though, the movie is a tired rehash of every WW II movie cliche.  It also features perhaps the most dreadful score of John Williams' career."
tt0111161,"This is indeed one of the best prison dramas I've ever seen. I've always been a fan of Tim Robbins and he doesn't let me down here. But I can't believe this is so high in the overall list (I would place it in the 150-200 range myself). Even if we just stick with Tim Robbins, 'The Player', 'Short Cuts' and 'Jacob's Ladder' are all far better films. It was the ending of the film that really disappointed me, but since I'm not allowed to talk about endings in these reviews I can't explain why! Suffice it to say that I can imagine at least two fairly obvious endings that would have been better. Maybe it's the 'American Factor', what with me being English, but the overrating of this film completely baffles me."
tt0993846,"The big problem with this movie is that it tells the story of a real-life, self-indulgent, amoral lowlife and the people dumb enough to be swept along by him, and it is, by all accounts, a pretty accurate portrayal of events. Consequently the viewer is ""treated"" to too much swearing, too much sex, too much drug-taking, too much teen boy humour ... and to cap it all, the film is too long.There are good bits about it. The acting is generally good and DiCaprio is great in the lead role. I always think he does dissolute, self-destructive characters much better than the more lightweight ones he often plays. It is mildly amusing in parts, and the soundtrack is also good. I guess it should also score points for accuracy - unfortunately!I suppose what it lacks is balance and morality. There was no portrayal of, or meaningful reference to, the victims in all this - the people who were conned by this guy and his business. I suppose it's also pretty unsatisfying in that it's not like the guy really got what was coming to him. A bit of jail-time and now I believe he's some sort of motivational speaker or whatever. I would have liked to see him suffer a bit more. So in some ways it's a celebration of getting away with it which is maybe why I find it a bit distasteful, but to be fair it's just a movie which is showing things they way they happened.I didn't hate it but I didn't particularly enjoy it either and I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was just too much of everything, the swearing became tedious, the sex was incredibly unsexy, and the drug-taking just got boring. It just goes to show that too much of anything really IS a bad thing. Despite liking some aspects I couldn't bring myself to rate it higher than 5, and DiCaprio's performance probably accounted for 4 of those stars. There is absolutely no way it deserves the 8+ it's currently got on IMDb. That's Goodfellas territory and this movie doesn't even come close I'm afraid."
tt0120737,"Based on the long-running hype surrounding this movie, not to mention the critical raves it has generally received, I knew that one of two things would happen when I went to see this movie:1) It would truly live up to the hype as one of the greatest movies of all time or,2) It would not match up.I am not surprised that, given the nature of mainstream, Hollywood blockbusters, that I fall into the second category. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", though exciting in parts, fails to maintain a constant stream of interest and energy, thus making it fall far short of the ""epic"" that many viewers are already calling it.Since most people on planet Earth are already familiar with the story, I won't go into great detail here re-creating it. From a plotting standpoint, the movie has several problems. Since Tolkien's work is so masterfully detailed, it would be difficult to completely portray every character with the depth and understanding that he did. But the beginning of the movie does just that, as the moviegoer is painted an excellent picture of the Hobbit Shire and the beauty and peace that this diminutive-sized but big-hearted race has achieved. But then the movie gets bogged down.Character after character is hastily introduced, as we are pushed through fight scene after fight scene. ""Fellowship"" suffers from the same syndrome that many action movies suffer from: despite the fact that the heroes are constantly pitted against insurmountable odds (in numbers, resources, etc.), they never seem to be in any real danger. And the movie generally stages a fight scene, gives the audience a few minutes to breathe, and then stages another fight scene. Although the fights are done well, what is lost is a true understanding of characters, as we never really get to know any of the main combatants. Worse yet, we eventually forget why they're fighting in the first place, since so many of the fight scenes fail to explain what is going on.Visually, the movie is occasionally stunning. But there are certain scenes (like the battle scene at the beginning of the movie) that look obviously computer-generated. Even the tightest military formation does not move in complete synce unless it is a COMPUTER SIMULATION. I did think that the camera angles and the way that the movie played with the actors' height was pretty great, though.I've heard a lot about how the acting in this movie was tremendous, but this is not a character-driven movie, so how can you tell? Except for Elijah Wood, I didn't feel like anyone really gave a performance worth remembering. There were no bad performances, mind you, but no one (except for Wood) really stood out.The monotony of the fight scenes made me anxious for the movie to end. I could feel the length of this movie, and that's generally not a good sign, unless you're dealing with an historical piece like ""Schindler's List"" or ""Ghandi"", where the time isn't as important as the story that's being told.In the end, this movie is not a ""Star Wars"" or a ""Godfather"" or anything of that nature. It morphs into a generic action feature that presents its audience with some exciting scenes, but ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive movie. I give it a 4/10, since it has some value, but isn't anywhere near the ""classic"" that people are hastily calling it.A final note on this movie being #1 in the IMDB. I wouldn't get worked up about this. Though the database has a great deal of value, weighing the historical importance of movie is difficult. We will have a more balanced picture 10 to 20 years from now about the importance of this movie. Even great movies that seemed like they would last forever after they were released (remember ""The English Patient""?) have faded into the background after a few years."
tt0993846,Had to re-watch this. Wild and explicit scenes but overall a well made film.
tt0993846,"I have just switched off The Wolf of Wall Street in.....well, shock frankly. After persevering for quite some time, because this is a film directed by Martin Scorcese for goodness sake! So felt it just had to get better any minute NOW.Unfortunately, it did not. Flabby and self indulgent. This required an excellent editor to step up and shout over the ego's: 'No really fellas......that just goes on and on and on.....keep it sharp!' Just shocked at how appalling this actually is. If this was a couple of guys just out of film school, would the critics have raved about it? Would it get nominated for Awards?More evidence of the ridiculousness of big award nights.I have read the reviews here of people who liked this film, and all respect to you. Everything is perception is it not? Where they see 'innovation' I see self indulgence and lack of editorial discipline. See what you think."
tt0653506,"Usually any MSW episode featuring Jessica and Dr. Hazlitt is a pleasantly entertaining passage of 45-plus minutes. William Windom always added a touch of class and intelligence to the roles he played, whether in motion pictures or in television.However, his and Jessica's camaraderie in this particular episode couldn't save this Godfather ripoff. Even the Don's two sons were named Michael (the level-headed married son who was going to take over the garment business upon his father leaving the country) and hot-tempered Salvador (similar to hot-headed Sonny played by James Caan), who has the red-headed floozy-ish girlfriend.Additionally, as the Don is leaving the restaurant with his wife and two sons to get into his vehicle (to head out of the country), stereotypical Italian Mafia-type background music starts to play.Finally, unlike the excellent Columbo series before this, many of the MSW episodes feature monumental overacting like the annoying Consiglieri's daughter causing an uproar in the restaurant as Jessica and Dr. Hazlitt chow down on their much-anticipated lobster feast."
tt0993846,"I was really interested to see Wolf of Wall Street, not just because its Scorsese and it's gotten so many nominations but also I cant remember a movie that my friends on Facebook have given such differing reviews to. I've read everything from Wow great movie! To What a waste of time. And I have to say, after seeing it yesterday, I come down pretty squarely in the middle. It was good. It was funny (in parts) It was drawn out (in parts). It was entertaining. But I don't think it's anywhere near the best movie of the year in fact I can think of a few movies that weren't even nominated (42 for example) that I thought were better overall movies.I kept feeling like I was watching Goodfellas but with Wall Street Greed as the driving force instead of Mafia Greed. Scorsese isn't the first film maker or writer to do this. You have a successful template of a story, you change some of the mitigating factors and voila! You have a new movie. Michael Crichton did the same thing with Jurassic Park. Go back and watch Westworld and it's pretty much the same movie (adult theme park where the attractions get out of control) with robots exchanged for genetically recreated dinosaurs. So I'm not knocking Scorsese but I will say this, Wolf is no Goodfellas. None of these characters rang as true to me as Henry Hill or Tommy and Jimmy.And that's the challenge with a movie like this. We have to like the villains. We have to pull for Tony Soprano or Henry Hill or Jordan Belfort because at the end of the day MOST people abhor that type of behavior so how you can you watch a movie like this and not want the protagonist to go down in flames? Answer: if somehow, against all logic and odds, we've fallen in love with them. And I don't think Scorsese did enough to make me love (or even like) Belfort and Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) and the rest.That's what the comedic scenes are for in these movies. When Joe Pesci does his classic, ""I'm funny? I'm here to amuse you?"" rant we want to be at that table. We want to be in that group because they are funny and cool and squeezing every last moment of joy from life. And that's what moments like the midget tossing are supposed to do for us in Wolf and like I said, I laughed at some of these (yes I laughed at the midget tossing, sorry) but overall, my mind never left the fact that
these guys were getting rich by taking innocent, hard working people's money and putting them into worthless investments. And when I say ""taking"" I get the fact that they were ""selling"" and not stealing and I think some people who love this movie see it as that: a triumph of master selling, another ""Boiler Room"" or ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" where the silver tongued ultimate salesmen proves he's superman and can do anything, but quite frankly if you lie and deceive to sell, I don't consider that selling. I consider it lying and deceiving. And I'd just as soon have you throw a brick threw my window or torch my store 'cause then at least I know who you are. So in the end, I never did fall in love with Belfort and his quaaludes and hookers enough to not want him to get busted (like I do when the helicopters are chasing Henry Hill)Scale of 1-10 I'd give Wolf a 6. Entertaining movie with funny moments. Coulda been a half hour shorter. And no way, IMO is it Best Movie of the year."
tt0993846,"I remember watching this movie and watching the boat scene with the FBI agent (not knowing at all who he was then) and liking his character so much that I was cheering for him to get Leo's character. Usually everyone HATES the cop/investigator. 5 years later I've now seen Homefront, Early Edition, Friday Night Lights and a number of Kyle Chandler's movies and definitely had it right. He's got that something that makes you root for him. Now when I watch the movie I find it hilarious instead of crude."
tt0139414,"And it's billed as a horror/comedy.Let's clear one thing, right away: I went to see this movie because I LIKE campy horror films, and that's what the cast and crew tried to deliver.That's why they failed. You can't TRY to be campy. Camp has to come naturally. If Ed Wood had TRIED to make Plan 9 bad, it wouldn't be so enjoyable; it'd just be BAD. That's what's wrong with Lake Placid. A bunch of big names hamming it up, spouting smarmy, self-referencing and self-parodying dialogue. This film was so lousy, I couldn't even root for the crocodile.Of the entire cast, there is one bright spot. Brendan Gleeson plays the Sheriff with more character and depth than you'll find in the rest of the cast, combined. He succeeds in being entertaining because his character is taking the movie seriously, so his 'funny' lines have actual comedic impact.Contrast this to Betty White. An old lady who swears? Wow! I love this movie! That's such a fresh, cutting-edge idea! This might be funny to a few eight-year-olds, I guess, and maybe that's the audience this movie was aimed at.I think even an 8-year-old, though, would have balked at the presence of an Asian saltwater crocodile swimming across the Atlantic and setting up housekeeping in upper North America. Even if it COULD make the 6000-mile trip, why WOULD it? So it could spend eight months out of the year hibernating in the frigid mud?The writers were very clever in convincing the audience on the reason WHY the crocodile made the trip: they dodged the question. Every time someone in the movie brings asks WHY?, the response is just a comment on how it COULD possibly happen, and isn't it amazing that it DID? If that's all the better they can come up with, they should have just used the old 'escaped pet gets huge' schtick. Even THAT would have improved this waste of film.This movie gets a 3 out of 10 (I gave one point for the crocodile animation and two points for Brendan Gleeson)."
tt0102926,"Foster's acting is so uninteresting and bland. Hopkins' escape is ridiculous, the killer looked very unsophisticated and stupid, the whole movie was full of weaknesses.Had potential but the serial killer was just too stupid, we never understood what motivated his killings, we never got a deep understanding of his character. All in all a dumb movie, extremely hyped"
tt0108052,"A movie about the 2nd world war in the 20th century.
How could these events even have happened?
Like all the rules of humanity did not apply.
See how Schindler handles the situation."
tt0137523,"Can't give anything away- just watch it, and then you'll want to watch it again."
tt0372784,"Sorry to upset die-hard Batman comic book fans, but I really hate and detest this movie. It is an insult to the 'Batman' I love and remember from my childhood. The Burton/Schumacher pictures were marvellous fun because they did not take themselves seriously. All I got from this one was a king-size headache and a sore bottom where I was bored senseless for the best part of two hours. Chris Nolan thinks 'Batman' should be taken dead seriously. A rich man who goes out at night in a rubber suit designed to resemble a bat? Oh, come on! Putting the Caped Crusader in a film like this is like making 'Austin Powers' the star of a Daniel Craig-type Bond film. Worse, the chief villain - The Scarecrow ( Cillian Murphy ) - is another nut, only this one runs round with a sack on his head! Michael Caine's 'Alfred' cannot hold a Bat-candle either to Alan Napier or Michael Gough. The story of this film...well, was there one? All I saw was a lot of fighting with nothing in-between. It has been announced that Warner Bros. are rebooting the franchise once more. Good idea. They need to use the Burton/Schumacher movies as a template for any further entries. This one hit the big screen with all the force of a wet lettuce. Ker-flop!"
tt1375666,"Great ideas grow like a cancer. Sometimes you never really know where they come from.Chris Nolan has never really had a totally original idea. Like Tarantino, he knows other movies so well, their ideas creep into his work, either intentionally or not. While my words on originality may come as inflammatory, my feeling toward his talent, and films is quite the opposite. He's good - real good. But he isn't original. Nobody is. This is the 21st century folks and its all been done. It is the way he's showing us these familiar things, that keeps us coming back.Except for Di Caprio, who never really convinces as a brooding widower/father, the rest of the band is perfect. Not that any of them are actually interesting, the plot is the real character in Inception. Hans Zimmers score is majestic and hugely epic and Wally Pfister's familiar clean visuals make it easy on the eyes.Much like a new roller-coaster at 6 Flags, Inception is a ride we've been on on before. Dreams, reality and all that jazz, but this one has a deeper dose of rabbit hole. We have a heist film set in the frame of corporate psychological espionage - whatever the hell that is.We get Matrix style pseudo reality and weightless gun fights. We get The Game and Total Recall style onion layers. We get the old man in the bedroom of cubist proportions from the Kubrick 2001 finale. Maybe one too many James Bond ski battles. And I'm just getting warmed up. The wife story rings hollow - in fact, it's downright boring. Exposition goes in circles and we never do get enough Watanabe Ken. But it's that layered time of the tiered dreams that makes this one go boom. The elevator that can't drop and that van that just falls forever with the cameras over cranking at 150 frames per second or more. But we don't want it to hit the water. Go deeper Cobb, cause I don't want to get off this one yet.The final joke with the unending spinner? This is Nolan's dream, not Cobb's.It's not visionary, it's not original, but just like the meandering Dark Knight or the wretched nonsense of the Prestige, or the titanic plot holes of Memento, Inception is a rabbit hole that owns you¬†til¬†it's over. This ain't art or philosophy to ride to the top. It's just one great kick all the way down.8/10"
tt0110912,I don't understand why this is the 8th highest rated movie of all time. I saw how highly rated it was so decided to watch it. After the first half an hour I found it enjoyable but my mind wasn't blown. As the movie continued I kept waiting for something to happen that warrants its 8.9 stars. Nothing actually happens in this movie. I hope its just me because through my eyes its the most overrated movie of all time.
tt1130884,"The trailer for the film gives away far too much and essentially ruins what would otherwise be an effective twist.I've never been too fond of twist endings, save maybe a few of the twists from old Twilight Zone episodes but I felt the twist in this film really made the film entirely pointless.We spend most of the movie engrossed in a detective story with a few flashback puzzle pieces and are left to wonder how those fit into the twist we all know is coming. The fact we all the twist from the trailer means its basically only a matter of time.I left the theater feeling hollow and annoyed. What is the point of all this? What are they trying to say about crazy people? In the end Andrew (Teddy for most of the movie) is to be lobotomized, so the message is about how sometimes drugs and respecting patients doesn't work so let's carve them open? Rather than creating an expertly crafted detective story we instead get an obvious twist (even to those who turned the channel every time the trailer was on) that halts the story. I cared about Teddy's demons, wanted him to get off the island but you can't yank the character around into someone else and expect me to still care about him when everything he's been characterized as and experienced has been one big delusion.It was still an okay film... just apparently not my style of film."
tt0108052,"Before I proceed to add any comments on the film, I must simply salute to this great human-being. Compassion and love is the most natural state of us humans, any other emotions of hatred, rage and violence are an alteration of our very being and existence. It is most commendable of Mr. Schindler to have stuck to his natural state amidst all the violence and the preaching of extreme hatred for Jews, amidst a world war to put it best. It is a perception that rich people care the least about the poor and the suffering, but above all is God Almighty's unbeatable Law of descending good people amongst bad people, and vice versa, and here he descended an angel in the form of a rich business, the best option, for the Jews who'd been suffering hopelessly. I smiled when he said to his secretary that if the German army becomes suspicious of the incompetent works done in his factory he'd buy ammunition and weapons from some other factory and then sell it to the army to keep things in control. A masterminded person!It was so touching and heartening to see him instead of feeling satisfied at his achievement or taking pride in it, he chose to cry and curse himself for having not saved even more lives and for not having used earlier opportunities to take this path. He cursed his rich lifestyle and the expensive things he bought for himself instead of spending even more money to save even more lives. Truly a sign of a great human-being who chose to reflect on his flaws instead of the good works he did, which itself was a huge, huge risk that could've cost him not only his status, business and money but also life if the army could've got even a minor sniff of it.On the film, since it was based on true events I can't really find faults and point to things they could've done differently. So no issues with it. However, two things annoyed me a bit, the first of which being it being in black and white. It prevented me from getting a good feel of the atmosphere, the surroundings and the whole drama. I felt as if I was looking at the screen from a place very far. So this wasn't a smart move on Spielberg's part in my view. By the way, I mean no disrespect to the films of years ago which were in black and white anyway. They'd to be shot that way and you as a viewer understood the limitation of the film-maker, but that can't be said of a film released in 1993.Secondly, although I fully admit that the film had to be full in every detail and very spread out with explanatory scenes, but still feel it could've been shortened at least by 20 minutes. Three hours is just way to long for a film of which its entertainment value is its least strength.In general, films on suffering and pain shouldn't be that long, never. Since such films are low on entertainment, the aim should be to make the viewer stayed focused throughout, and if the film turns out to be as long as three hours then somewhere in the middle of it you'll find the viewers scratching their head, looking left and right, talking to others in order to re-find their focus after a few minutes break. In short, such films should be shorter in length."
tt1375666,"I heard a number of great things about Inception, including from my sister who came out saying it was one of the cleverest and best movies she'd seen. After seeing it for myself, I thought it was a good film, but not as good as I was led to believe. Out of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen, Inception didn't wow me as much as Memento and The Prestige, and it is one of my least favourites of his so far. Does that mean the film is bad? No, I am just saying I do not think it is Nolan's best as I have heard people say.My main problem with Inception was the lack of emotional attachment, I do understand completely anybody who says it is emotionally cold. Particularly in the characters, they are written and acted well, but not much is done to make us empathise with them and their predicaments. I loved the idea of the story, it was clever and somewhat original and it did start very compelling and intriguing, but as the film progresses it does become rather convoluted and I found myself losing a little interest. Also, the pace is uneven, as the characters became more cold and the story more convoluted, the film really does start to drag until the conclusion where the film does thankfully pick up.Inception despite these faults does have a number of strengths, especially the beautifully crafted production values, dream sequences and effects and Nolan's superb direction. Hans Zimmer's score is incredibly good too, while powerful and haunting it rarely becomes overbearing, while the dialogue is on the whole clever and thought-provoking. The acting is generally very good, both Leonardo DiCaprio, with a more hardened persona which has grown even more, and Ellen Page give strong performances and while Marion Cotillard is underused she is pretty good as well and Cillian Murphy I think gives the best supporting performance as he is superb.Overall, Inception is a generally good film but not as good as it is lauded to be. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0172495,"after a row of forgettable films Ridley Scott returned to former glory with this glorious adventure straight out of the realms of the 60's peplums(which can still be seen every easter and Xmas,full of adverts,on TV.it was surely a risk,however, ticket sales,DVD sales,critical reviews and a handful of Oscars,showed the production team had got it right.what they hadn't got right was historical correctness,the list of errors is longer than the final credits,but who cares,this is a film to sit back and enjoy,not improve your knowledge of roman history.a visually beautiful movie,with wonderful performances by all involved,gladiator has something unusual in todays cinema for the masses,Maximo.Crowe's interpretation of the general as a family man,loyal comrade is full of fateful exoticism perfect for the times he lived in,and worthy of Crowe's place as a great actor'."
tt7286456,"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways."
tt0381429,"This is a beautiful lyrical film, quite atypical for recent Australian fare (ie it's good). They've bravely foregone the obvious and stereotypical locations such as beach, outback or suburbia, and set it in Australia's high country, the Snowy Mountains. The bleak but beautiful landscapes reminded me of some Russian films.The lead actress plays a girl on the cusp of womanhood to perfection, she swings from adolescent to adult to child in a heartbeat. The lead actor was if anything better, although less immediately eye-catching. His portrayal of a young man too afraid to acknowledge his feelings to himself is superb.Unreservedly recommended."
tt0120737,"Absolutely epic! The scale is truly mind blowing. Every filmmaking aspect is beyond incredible. Especially the score, set design & dialogue. The emotional weight & amazing battles seal it."

tt0137523,"The ambiguity of the frustrated striker characters is the first reflection on Finch's elaborate run. The violent spirit of an unsuccessful, helpless gray employee, against the soft and societal practices of work, makes him a lawless and cruel man. Alone alone and narrator of the story, he escapes with his imaginary rebellious symbol and escapes the cell of taboos and moral and social fears. The two are missing and the other is a guide. The battle for victory is one that leads them to ultimate victory. Victory is the same as overcoming the two long-standing companions of helplessness: pain and suffering. Physical pain and mental suffering. The two should not be afraid and the two should not be commanded. Physical pain should be packed into fists and knocked over. Every blow they make must foster a rebellion within them - like the germ of a lamb in the face of the death of a helpless fetus. Suffering but not from the skin. All from within. It must be burned in the spleen whether it be pain or pain. You have to stare in the mirror and say, 'I have no pain, so I can get away with it even with pain.The exciting and energetic play of Pete and Edward Norton himself makes this the path of suffering for the film viewer throughout the tension. The tension that places the viewer in the spotlight like a lazy after work. The Challenge and the Whole Viewer Demands a lot of inside work along with the crude images of the viewer. You have to live inside the net to admire watching and touching on the story of the film: the complex psychotic journey of helplessness, fear and frustration.We said that the main character in the story is unaware of his duality and rejects it. It is with him that the story begins and is a manifestation of frustration, revenge, and pointlessness. The protagonist of his character is a leader who knows nothing but pain and suffering in this field and has found the path to victory: skirmishes and deadly physical exercises until no force can stand up to him. Have. But the story does not just flow like a zigzag, but into a dreadful basement. The underground I was born in the sixties to remember was the fertile soil around the world that had a garden of happiness and happiness in it. And there are still many who do not come out of this basement.The two, one firm and the other hesitant, set up a club for training. The leader who kills himself, both in the offensive and in the defender position, confesses to his opponents with impatience. It teaches them that power in the hands of the spirit is hard and fearless, not in heavy fists of hesitation, and ultimately in thought. Doubting winning or losing everything is the key to winning every scary battle. The club fosters youth. It makes them ready to face the toughest of pains and threats. And at the same time, he teaches them that the path to ultimate victory is not just the struggle to the death but the undisputed obedience of the leader. The method of training is also brainwashing. The disbelief of the club members becomes a certainty that they dare not look out from the corridor through the basement. Everyone is on guard.The club leader, now distant from the staunch pretense of being frustrated, is determined to experience a combination of power. The clash now has the potential of a whole underground group. What was fascinating about the experience of fear and violence now turns into a roaring train of dreams and desires. The dream of power, along with the order of blindness that calls for compulsory obedience, makes the club ready to practice hostage-taking, ransom and terror. In the long run, however, the club is awaiting inconsistencies and disagreements. As long as the two original founders of the club face each other. A frustrated rebel who no longer even knows his own sex stands against his brave orbit counterpart. The bloody controversy is watched by the secret cameras of a parking lot. A young man is shown by the cameras, who are mad at him. He is the film's first helpless employee.The winner of the bloody controversy at the end of the film is on the rigid and inflexible character of the story. He continues the pretense of disgruntled power and humiliation to the point where it leaves only one option for the opponent, suicide. The loose and shaky character of the movie Now, in the presence of his ardent pretense, he pulls the gun tube and pulls the trigger. One who dies and dies is one of them: a hard head pretending to have shattered his brain. The moment he stands in the face of the violent personality, disgusted with violence and assassination, is the one who is the ultimate victor and ends this story.It's not boring to break into other themes of the movie. Including making soap from human bodies and the role of women and the status of women alongside these story characters."
tt1130884,"Big disappointment here folks. The movie relies too much on atmosphere and stretches 90 minutes of plot over 2 1/2 hours of film.The film would most definitely have benefited from trimming its running time to 90 minutes. Seriously.Sure DiCaprio is great as ever, but there's just not enough in this movie to sink your teeth into.And it's TOTALLY an M. Night Shyamalan ripoff. Which isn't a compliment by any means! Don't get mislead by some of the other reviewers who try to compare this movie's slowness to say, Hitchcock's Vertigo. Sorry, but no way is the comparison even close! Don't waste your money on this one folks...even if you're a die hard DiCaprio fan.Get the DVD out of your local library for free instead.And by the way, I'm a huge Scorsese fan so you know I'm totally disappointed."
tt0372784,"""Batman Begins"",praised and paraded by the critics BUT if nothing else this movie proves as a fine example of just how wrong they can be. Although the movie was original and interesting in places it generally gave the feeling of never really beginning,as if something was just about to happen......but it never did.(ha ha,rather ironic as I look to the title now). Christian Bale was well cast as the moody beginner in the batman suit but the general atmosphere of the movie was a disappointment and ruined a potentially interesting character.Michael Caine was the only light relief from the depressingly moody and overly dramatic sequences with other characters. That girl from Dawsons Creek (insert name here) was positively cringe worthy trying to play a character who is strong and deep,when really all the audience can concentrate on is her misshapen teeth,scarily thin waist and stomach churning squeaky voice. The movie poorly endeavours to give a more realistic feel to the franchise yet still indulges in many fantastical moments,and I feel the two aspects don't gel well. Unlike Burtons triumphs with his Gothic style but believable back stories,this movie tells us too much but provides little in the way of action,humour or visual fun. Furthermore the ""Villain"" who proved as a camp,menacing monster in Burtons movies,with fine examples such as the Joker and Catwoman,""Batman Begins"" excuses consists of a camp busy-body who occasionally dons a filthy mask,wails for a while,and calls himself the scarecrow from time to time,who is then defeated quicker than a foot to a cockroach,he is poorly seconded by an ageing warrior type figure who is about as menacing,frightening or indeed interesting as a fat ginger cat. The only promising aspects of the movie,were the simple style costume which was a welcome return from the suit with nipples which made us all cringe in batman and robin,the heart warming and believable relationship with Bruce and Alfred,and indeed Bale himself.But to all those of you who were left laughed out and awestruck by Burtons dark camptastic masterpieces this movie will certainly disappointed,and now I shall finish on that very note,shamelessly screaming and howling at the top of my voice BRING BACK BURTON!!!"
tt0361748,"I just got back from watching the uk preview. It is certainly a very interesting film, and absolutely nothing like the trailer suggested. I'll avoider spoilers, but it is worth pointing out that the eponymous 'basterds' are hardly in the film, and it doesn't really follow their exploits. In fact the bulk of the film is based around a revenge story for a female jew who's family has been massacred by the nazi's.Tarantino displays several styles. The much-emphasized contemporary-western style all but disappears after the first, brief chapter. His nouvelle vague influences return with full force, as do his 70s-inspired ott gimmicks, and their are traces to all his previous films here. Personally I'm not sure they all fit, and I didn't feel the film always knew where it was going.The pro's. The film has two utterly excellent scenes, the first is the opening 20 minute scene of the film involving a french farmer and a nazi commander, the second involving a secret meeting between allies in a tavern basement. Both are tense, thrilling, and beautifully shot and acted. Another brief standout scene is the introduction of the Basterds as a tale retold be a survivor. Also, M√©lanie Laurent gives a brilliant performance throughout, with only a bit of corny dialogue later on as she transforms into 'the bride' character, stilted dialogue and all. Secondly, Christoph Waltz is very good as the films central antagonist, and who you get the feeling Tarantino is rooting for all along.The con's. Firstly, Tarantino has replaced his own inappropriate cameos with a new one, Eli Roth's poor acting stands out throughout the movie and really serves as an unnecessary distraction. Secondly, the film has no real focus, it is a collection of quite-long scenes, held together entirely by coincidence, which seem to come and go with no real connection to those before or after. Perhaps this is due to the third problem, the film seems to have a LOT missing. Only two of the Basterds get any development, and this is minimal. We don't know where any of the films character come from or what motivated them, even those who the film highlights. The film's two main plots never really come together, and the films climax is explosive, but not particularly gratifying (although others may disagree with this).As much as I enjoyed Kill Bill, Tarantino seems unwilling to return to the kind of easy naturalism and character development that made his first two films so exceptional. His style is very deliberate, but for me it often seems like he's trying too hard. More akin to Jackie Brown (as I remember it at least) this film is uneven, with some incredible scenes and some great characters, but a lot of inappropriate gimicky cheese and underdeveloped ideas too.I'm sure many will love this film, and given times and multiple viewings, I may do too. But initial reactions on first viewing are certainly uneven."
tt0114369,"Throughout history the Bible and its wisdom have been used as an excuse for murder. The director in ""Seven"" cleverly makes use the seven sins as Kevin Spacey's Divine permission to commit the biggest biblical sin of them all; murder! While Spacey is sacrificing his victims in the name of religion and punishing them in graphical behavior for their weaknesses; Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt appear as the prophets defending and protecting all that is good by trying to catch him. The director David Fincher keeps you on the edge of your seat as you watch each brutal murder appear across the screen and as you watch Freeman and Pitt getting closer to their killer. Freeman always appears the wiser while Pitt gets more and more engulfed with rage as the killer taunts his pursuers while punishing his victims. We the viewers, are filled with anger and wrath (one of the sins themselves), as we want the killer to be caught but we realize at the end that he wants more than that! At the end the shocking revelation takes over our minds and fills us with even greater anger as we want Spacey punished! We also want him dead for his last brutal act! We also want Pitt to kill him! The question to be asked, is the unborn child saved from been born in a world full of religious contradiction or should those who wrong us be punished without question?"
tt0313792,"Remember the last ten minutes of ANNIE HALL (a classic that I love)? Woody writes a play about his experiences, and two college kids audition for the roles.That's what this entire movie is like to watch.Jason Biggs has the rather unfortunate job of portraying the 'Woody' role, and he does so by putting on a coat and a deep voice. The effect is like watching your child put on your shoes and coat and walk around pretending to be mature.Christina Ricci preens and poses to better effect, but still one would have to suspend all disbelief to imagine her having a deep thought in her head at all.ENTIRELY miscast, Woody plays the role Danny DeVito is perfect for, Danny DeVito plays the role Woody is perfect for, and there are several 'hot young things' who have one or two lines here or there.The whole affair left me remembering when Woody Allen cast his films with care, rather than looking at the box office and finding the latest hot young thing.  I ended up feeling sorry for all the actors, and rushing out to rent MANHATTAN, which, like Annie Hall, remains a classic, and will always be there to remind us of what once was with Woody Allen."
tt0172495,"I absolutely love Ridley Scott.  ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" both rank among my favorite films.  ""Gladiator,"" though, just didn't work for me.Russell Crowe is a fantastic actor, and really ought to be a big, big, big star.  Unfortunately, he's not given much to do here.  He fights, he broods, he whines...but he's never really forced to stretch his talents.My main quibble, I suppose, is that the movie was clearly going for ""Braveheart"" effect, and it fails.  It was easy to get some sympathy going for Mel Gibson's character in ""Braveheart.""  He was fighting for freedom and justice.  Sadly for ""Gladiator,"" it's pretty hard to develop much sympathy for any particular faction within the Roman empire.  Where ""Braveheart"" was able to give us a few effective hallucinations and dream sequences, ""Gladiator"" shoves it down our throat with oddly-colored, tripping-on-acid dream sequences every five minutes.  Yes, we get the point.  He misses his family, and he'll see them in the afterlife.  Move on already!Apart from the dream sequences, the movie does look pretty spectacular.  The Colliseum is an impressive sight.  The costumes, for once in a sword-and-sandal epic, don't look like the costume department simply raided the bedding department at K-Mart.  And the fight scenes are, indeed, entertaining and visceral.In the end, though, the movie is less than the sum of its parts."
tt0111161,"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"".The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want."
tt0120815,"There's violence and there's violence. With the huge numbers of personal reviews of this movie, I'm hard pressed to add much. The first half hour affected me like no other in recent years. I wondered as the boys threw up on the amphibious carriers whether they were seasick or scared beyond belief. When one uses the expression ""cannon fodder"" so casually, do we realize that this means the second wave makes it's way to the beach over the dead and dying bodies of the first wave, like ants sacrificing themselves to ford a puddle. The ones that get through, get through because there are only so many bullets and so many people. They are exposed, disoriented, helpless--they have no place to go but ahead. I will be haunted forever by the soldier searching, then finding his dismembered arm in the carnage. I will remember those trying to get above water, only to be cut down below the surface. If anyone has a heart, his or her attitude toward war should never be the same. How can we who have never been there have a hint of what it must have been like. Like Schindler's List on the Holocaust, this should be a training film on war."
tt0409594,"I'm sure this is a show no one is that familiar of and might not think good of it; after all it is almost close to Baywatch Hawaii. With the cast, the location, style of the directing and its publicity ¬ñ shows women walking around on the beach and all that. No wonder people have misconception and decide not to watch it.It was wrong of them to do that. Cause after I decide to watch the show, there are actually more thing going on, real juicy story and conflict, turn out to be really exciting to watch and pretty much ¬ñ addictive.The story of the hotel clerks, the manager, the owner and their complicated love life. Also enter the troublesome hotel's visitor and powerful man trying to steal the hotel. It actually more exciting than it sounds here.I won't deny that the acting suck but it ain't that bad that you'll look away. The story is not so consistence but good enough. The soundtrack is fitting pretty well with the scenario and the action is all the time. I took me couple of episode before there is actually anything happen solidly so be patience.Recommendation: I Really Do Enjoy Watching This. Zillion Times Better Than Expected.Rating: 7.5/10 (Grade: B)Please Rate My Review After Reading It, Thanks."
tt0372784,"Nobody doubt that Nolan's trilogy is, so far, the best option for those who want to watch some Batman movie and i totally agree with that. ""Batman Begins"" starts it really well, it is a great super hero movie, very realistic and dark, with a incredible well developed story (for a super hero movie, at least).
But it's not perfect.-Why do you think so? - you ask meI just don't see Christian Bale as a good Bruce Wayne, i mean, i think he doesn't inpire that strong personality we expect coming from Bruce Wayne.Another thing that i really disliked about that movie, is how they made Scarecrow look like just an ordinary vilain. I mean, the whole plot is about destroying Gotham through fear, and Scarecrow is the face of fear itself in Batman universe, but here, as i already said, he was just an ordinary vilain, who was defeated by an ordinary taser (???????) and was just working for Ra's Ghul, who was the real vilain of the movie.Despite of that, i really enjoyed the movie, and think it was a great start. 8/10"
tt0848228,"Uninspired high gloss kiddie comic adaption with acceptable visual effects and a screenplay that fits on one sheet of toilet paper...It is almost incredible how this Movie could be so highly rated. Must be indebted by the target group which exists from nerd comic-fans and teenagers without an clue what makes a good movie...The characters are flat and as a result none of the (normaly good) actors is capable of convincing.What's left is the typical action-loaded special effects spectacle. But even in this category nothing is extraordinary or surprising.Let's hope, that someone saves us from a sequel, is hard to underbid that..."
tt0172495,"Rewatched this movie today. I am convinced it is the most perfect movie ever made. It has a strong female character, positive and realistic minority rep (the Roman Empire extended into Africa and I think lots of people forget that), and a compelling revenge plot. Every line moves the plot forward and is memorable. The music is gorgeous. The acting is impeccable. The visuals are absolutely stunning - especially the rose petals raining down as the emperor is ascending on the platform. The visual of the emperor dead in the colosseum while the crowd lifts Maximus away. The whole concept of Elysium makes me cry every time. The ending couldn't have wrapped everything up better."
tt0523245,"It's Patty Regan's episode! In lesser hands, it might not have succeeded as well.....but she made for a wonderful installment for the 2nd season.I just love that Samantha and Darrin go with this piece of witchcraft. Both are on the side of Dolly and her dream.It had been a long time since I'd seen this, and hoped that the plot would not be, um, pedestrian. I needn't have worried."
tt0139414,"This movie is like ""Jaws"" with a funny twist, but this time, it involves a huge crocodile. The movie starts off with a quiet town in Maine suddenly being disturbed by a man-eating creature. Animal control and sheriff officials are tapped in to investigate, joined by a scientist.Each character in the movie has his/her own personality and charm, and all blends in to make the film a very exciting and entertaining feature. Bill Pullman as Jack Wells is a reserved, down-to-earth animal control officer who is dedicated in finding the creature; Bridget Fonda is a witty, sarcastic and dry-humored scientists from the city, who endlessly pokes fun at the townspeople; Oliver Platt as Hector Cyr delivered a corny, obsessed he-man with a personal vendetta with crocodiles, and Brendan Gleeson as Sheriff Hank Keough gave an outstanding performance who gets caught in Cyr's crocodile traps and has a dead-pan delivered one-liners: hilarious. In addition, Betty White gave an outrageously wicked and devious performance as Dolores Bickerman. Known for her role as ""Rose"" in the sit-com ""The Golden Girls,"" White's performance as Mrs. Bickerman is a delightful departure from the innocent and simple Rose, foul-mouthed, cold and unbelievably funny.This movie is one outstanding humor after the next, blend in with adventure and action, and is sure to entertain you all the way.So, remember never to feed the crocodiles, or else they will wound up as big as the one in this movie."
tt0139414,"I walk into this movie expecting it to be bad.  Yes, it was.  The dialogue was the first thing to hit me.  Or maybe it missed me.  It wasn't too strong and action wasn't too intriguing.  The only redeemimg quality about this movie was Betty White.  She was hilarious in this film (the real reason why I went to see the film) but deserved more scenes and more lines."
tt7286456,"If it wasn't for the title and make-up, you wouldn't know it was based on the comic-book character. First of all, the real Joker is not a weak and unconfident pushover. Not even in his genesis stage. The real Joker had a high tolerance for pain, could fight and was intelligent. Which made him dangerous due to his insanity. When Joaquin shoots the guy on the subway, he does it out of cowardice. They try to make up for it with the Murray shooting scene. There is no way that Joaquin's Joker will ever fill the shoes of the badass Joker in the comics, not even the different incarnations by different comic authors....and just forget about even coming close to Heath Ledger's portrayal. They should have just called the movie something totally different and forget about trying to make the connection."
tt7286456,"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope."
tt0111161,"Deliberately (some might even say slowly in places) paced, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" alternates between offering a grittily realistic portrayal of life in prison and flights of fancy that make the story too unbelievable to really be accepted. There is an interesting subplot (which doesn't take up much of the movie but which does make the viewer ponder) about the difficulties of adjusting to life in the real world after extended periods of incarceration.The performances from the two leads are excellent. Morgan Freeman puts on his usual outstanding performance as ""Red"" - the wise old con through whose eyes the story is told, and Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresnce, a young banker wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover who has to adjust to the nightmare of prison life. Among the supporting cast I was impressed with Bob Gunton as the Bible-spouting but corrupt Warden Norton, who uses Andy's financial expertise to enrich himself, and James Whitmore as Brooks, imprisoned for fifty years and terrified when he is finally granted parole and who, unable to adjust to life on the outside, yearns only to be back in the only home he ever knew - prison. It's an interesting twist - experience also by Red later on in the movie - that freedom can seem to be like a prison for those so accustomed to the regimentation of life in an institution.While the movie is impressive and engrossing all the way through, though, there are some weaknesses to the story that bothered me a bit. (There are some spoilers ahead.)I found it difficult to imagine prison guards from all over the State of Maine bringing their tax returns to Andy. It just didn't seem to me like something that would have happened. It also struck me as unlikely that a letter-writing campaign from one solitary prisoner (even one that lasted six years, one letter a week) would have convinced the State to fund the improvements Andy got for the prison library. I would rather expect that after a while the letters would simply start to be discarded. Andy's escape also bothered me. It was too ""easy"" - even though it took twenty years. And how did he keep that suit so spotless and unwrinkled while crawling through that dirty sewer? Mind you, the moments leading up to the discovery of his escape were among the most dramatic in the movie. The very end of the story was also clearly telegraphed some time before.Frankly speaking, I think ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a bit over-rated here at IMDb, being ranked the second best movie of all time, but this is still a very, very good movie, and an excellent portrayal (through Andy) of the survival of the human spirit in even the toughest times. Personally, I give it a 7/10."
tt0167260,"The conventional wisdom that this is the best of the three is certainly true, but I still can't call this a great movie. Just like the others in the series, there's lots of style but just not much story. And also just like the others, it's a three hour movie that would have made a better two hour movie. The FX are remarkable, but the characters for me are still just not all that interesting. I'm not sure how it was accomplished, but Jackson managed to put over nine hours on film without creating characters I cared about (with the exception of a modest amount of sympathy for the long-suffering Sam). I enjoy sci-fi, fantasy, and adventure flicks, but watching this for me was more like an endurance test than a three hour escape into fantasy. I'm sure lots of Tolkien fans out there are going to be deeply offended, but I'm afraid there are some of us that don't find the stories all that gripping."
tt0120815,"Count me among the group of dissenters that thinks ""Saving Private Ryan"" is 20 minutes of technically expert film-making capped by 140 minutes of monotonous war film punctuated by treacly and typical Spielbergian emotional histrionics.Spielberg's attempts at meticulously recreating the Omaha Beach invasion that take up the first half hour or so of this film are stunning. But the film grinds to a halt after that with a lame story and shallow characters that go nowhere. Spielberg wants us all to feel guilty (doesn't he always) about what soldiers in WWII went through, but his way to do that is to throw brutal violence in our faces every few minutes. The thing is, it's not the violence that makes other and better war films bring home the horrors of war to its audience; it's the depiction of what war does to a man's psyche. It's another film from 1998 set during WWII combat, Terence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line,"" that stands as the year's masterpiece about war. But audiences ignored that film because Malick wasn't willing to hold their hands and tell them how they should feel, something Spielberg could teach a class in.Grade: B"
tt0172495,"Gladiator isn't such a bad movie, nor a good movie.  The storyline is interesting, and so is the acting.  One thing it lacks is the setting.  It's always dark, especially in the beginning.  One other characteristic that it lacks is a good ending.  I don't want to reveal it, but it was typical. Gotta make something new.  My cousin loved this movie, however."
tt0167260,"We find out the back story of fickle Gollum, how he came to be the opposite of solemn, how the ring that he acquired, was the only thing desired, as it removed Sm√©agol, and most of his decorum. Some years later and he's guiding Frodo on, caught in a web to which the Hobbit has been drawn, where he's bound in threads of slob, from the spider called Shelob, it's lucky Sam has cottoned on, to what's gone wrong. A mighty battle is played out at Gondor's capital, at Minas Tirith the stage is taken by the damnable, Oliphaunt-riding Haradrim, almost claim victory and win, as the temperature goes up, the tensions palpable."
tt0102926,"I'll never forget my first viewing of this movie at the theater and will always look back fondly on it for one reason: helping me quit smoking cigarettes.I read the book first, was fascinated by it, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.Although entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch, especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer, ""Buffalo Bill."" ""Bill"" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent ""Clarice Starling"" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as ""Jack Crawford."" A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts ""Clarice,"" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.""Silence Of The Lambs"" has turned into a modern-day ""classic."" If by some odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark, difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off other things."
tt0068646,"I just don't get it. Sure the acting in some parts of the movie is good, but honestly, the entire ""angry Italian""-role is probably the easiest character to play. And i really don't get how every other character other then the ""angry Italian"" seems underdeveloped, plain boring and uninteresting.The only way for you to like this movie is by sympathize with the characters. And sympathizing with the bad guys (since almost every main character is a murderer and a mob member, even the protagonist is a bad guy)is difficult, although not impossible. If the director makes the evil sides of those characters redeemable, then it would be a lot easier for the viewer to sympathize and worry about the protagonist if he/she was in danger. When i however see Michael Corleone in danger in this movie, every time i wish for him to be killed, for i feel nothing for him. Which means that watching this movie was a waste of time.Although the soundtrack is quite good so instead of a rating of ""1"" The Godfather will receive a ""2"" out of generosity..."
tt1345836,"I just finished seeing this movie or the second time. It is difficult to find something I liked about this movie and I am a fan o Batman and this kind of movies in general. I've seen hundreds of action movies, from 50's to today.Previous batman movies were closer to the hero. This one shows a broken batman who does not want to be batman. Suddenly he decides he wants to save the city. His loyal servant abandons him when he decides to save the city. Everything is different than the batman we know and love.This one is definitely the worst batman movie ever. Cristian Bale the worst batman. Michael Keaton was far better for the role. I didn't enjoy this movie at all. I saw it only because it was a batman movie. Too much talking and little real batman action."
tt0422272,"A nurse with history is new to the remote island hospital with a boogie-patient living there among the children. This nurse is there presumably to overact the children better. She does this with earnest but with all her overdoing of pretty much everything the kids keep snapping they bones. There's no suspense, no scares, no reason to care. That scene with the 800,000 times the doctor declares, ""Clear!"" So we can watch her jump again, um, riveting."

What a waste of acting talent, the only bright spot was the good casting /production values which made the film tolerable to sit through but I never want to see it again although I did enjoy the first two films and have watched them several times. The directing was poor, the writing was poor, character development was poor, and the actors were not allowed to act to their potential. Scenes were drawn out, some were dead ends (long and drawn out dead ends, perhaps this was an even longer film and too much was cut out to shorten it? The film was as a dirge. Perhaps it should have been named the ""The Dark Knight Trudges On"". Only ONE moment of comedic relief and it was not original but the film was so droll the joke, any joke, was appreciated. This movie could have been standard length and been much better or much longer (with fewer dead ends) and perhaps better. Another film which was clearly done to just rake in the residual dough."

tt0133093,"A good adaptation of Plato's allegory of the cave, only let down at times by some wooden or corny acting. The Greek, and original, version of ""Know Thyself"", (Gnothi Seauton), was inscribed in the forecourt of the temple to Apollo at Delphi, the site of the Delphic Oracle, the most important Oracle in the classical Greek world. Plato employs the fundamental principle of 'Know Thyself' extensively in his books by having the character of Socrates use it as the means of motivational emphasis in his dialogues. Neo is good and Trinity fabulous in the catsuit."
tt0816692,"I won't give it a 1 to even things up a little, I give it a 6 which is real. Maybe 6.5 but 7 would be a stretch. I'm disappointed with a film that I waited for so long, with a great title that was waisted. Interstellar should have been a masterpiece, with, well, a lot of Interstellar traveling. The duration is just to long, especially the first part, which brings nothing extra to the story. It's just to stretched out trying to bring I don't know what. A feel of 2001 maybe, but 2001 is in another galaxy for this one. I didn't like Inception either, so maybe it has got to be something with Nolan. I'm a sci-fi fan, but today everyone's trying to make sci-fi, but they don't succeed. They are doing it wrong! District 9 was the last good sci-fi I watched. Interstellar has got great visuals, I give it that, but Gravity had more (another film that sucked big time). I wouldn't watch it again."
tt0133093,"This movie maybe many things , exceptional is certainly one of them . Bringing a high concept storyline stuffed with pretty cool action , most of the times leads to a hapazard product . Balancing the action and the story development in the movie is a pretty difficult part , and the Directors nailed it here ! You will never feel like the movie is being drifting itself out of the track or is stressing to pronounce certain things .The concept it deals with is quite philosophical and questions our thoughts and reality. However , it never feels didactic and never try to preach something . The Audience are given fair amount of space to actually process the events which develops the bond and relatibility with the movie. The pace of the movie is fast , and more or less maintains it throughout the length of the movie . The only negative aspect I noticed that , in some scenes the dialogue delivery was not upto the mark and felt that a little bit of emotions would not have done bad or make the product cliche .However , as a whole , this movie is certainly revolutionary with its action sequences and slow mo scens . Some scenes were a visual spectacle for action lovers ! Mixed with an awesome background music , the action scens were certainly treated to give a adrenaline rush and it did !"
tt1130884,"This movie promised to be an intelligent, suspenseful early-season blockbuster with big budget stars and production values. Unfortunately, it turned out go be a derivative, predictable combination of CUCKOO's NEST and WICKERMAN. It features the trip to a mysterious island, being trapped in an insane asylum, stormy nights, hallucinations, and not so surprising plot twists. At best, it can be described as a Hollywood clich√©.It was clearly intended as a showcase piece for Leondardo. Unfortunately he is not aging well in performance or appearance.The story begins with a seasick Leonardo throwing up into a toilet. This scene set the tone for the entire film.Fortunately, there were some good performances by supporting cast members, particularly Ben Kingsley.I can usually understand why people rate films well, even if they aren't to my taste, but I honestly don't understand why viewers liked this one."
tt0429078,"excerpt, more at my location - Given Tsui Hark's lengthy CV, expectations are understandably high for any of his films, and Seven Swords is no exception. An explosion of unlikely influences, a celebration of genre, a clash of cultures, it should be a multifaceted film wrapped up in layers of meaning. But whether Hark satisfies the challenge that he has set himself remains debatable.Seven Swords is an admirably accessible beginner's guide to Eastern cinema, but for most, it has opened the doors far too wide and the substance has fallen out. Perhaps original and bold for fearless genre experimentation, and certainly striking for its imagery, it offers nothing to challenge the viewer or even engage them. Placing audiences in an ambiguous position, it makes for uncomfortable viewing - is Hark sharing a story with them, or just patronising them? In either case, more fool him: boredom is inevitable in this painful and over budgeted mess."
tt0120815,"I heard so many great things about 'Saving Private Ryan' that my curiosity for this movie turned to pure shock as I watched it. I have to say that I really do not like war movies, so thats an obvious bias against this movie, but there were sooooooooooo many things about this movie that just made it a laughing stock of me and my friends. The cinematography in this film is simply amazing, in fact i'd say some of the best cinematography i've ever seen, but despite it's technical excellence, SPR is a pathetic, manipulative attempt by Speilberg to make him feel better about himself. The only character development in the movie takes place in the scenes before that particular character's death, it's happens in EVERY case; it's like clockwork. The ending is absolutely horrendously manipulative, and in fact the whole story doesn't really make sense as a result of it. SPOILER ALERT - don't read any farther if ya don't want to ruin the flick for yourself. At the beginning we have the shot of that old man at the grave, then it closes in on him and his memory begins of what happened... the only thing is that we find out the old man is really Ryan, not Tom Hank's Character, so i'm wondering how Ryan has all these memories of the beaches and the rest of the movie. Theoretically shouldn't the 'memories' start when Ryan enters the movie? Oh well, I can see arguments against my point, but the use of some certain camera angles REALLY makes the point of saying that the old man is Tom Hanks. I found this movie, above all things (even manipulative) to be extremely boring. Here's another case of a movie that had a about a 12 minute story stretched out to infinity. There are hundreds of little things that made me laugh about this movie in the wrong way, and obviously I won't go into all of them but I do feel this movie makes the German Armies look rediculous, specifically in the tank scene. There is many shots of the American soldiers running across open areas with dozens of germans shooting at them but they hardly ever get shot, while the Americans seem to hit somebody with every single bullet, and three people with every explosive. Other humorous moments include Tom Hanks diffusing a potentially hostile situation by telling everybody that hes a school teacher and the weak,poetry loving-'i've never shot anybody'- soldier killing a guy for no real reason in the situation. The performances were pretty good, I guess, but the script was so laughable that most of the things the guys say make you crack up no matter how well they say them. If you wanna see a good war movie, see Platoon, or if you hate war movies like I do, and you feel like watching a war satire, check out Starship Troopers."
tt0372784,Cheese and snooze fest with horrible one liners littered everywhere. Predictable storyline without any real character development.Probably Bale's worst role.
tt0120815,"Overlt long.
There were a few griping gripping scenes, but most of the time I was just wishing it would end soon."
tt0114369,"Despite the presence of the surely very talented Freeman and Pitt, this early David Fincher film is, like his other early films such as Alien 3, marred by his strange artistic obsession with grime and filth (every location and even the look of the film is dirty, scummy and excessively grimy for no realistic reason). Having said this, in his more recent films, such as The Game (Sean Penn and Michael Douglas), Fincher has grown out of this style and made some excellent movies."
tt0993846,"I really can't believe anyone likes this movie. It is an over-budgeted indulgence in offensive (intentionally, I think)...what I guess you would call ""soft porn""...that seems to have no point. The filmmakers seem to show the same contempt for the audience that the ""wolf"" shows to his clients. Throw a bunch of lewd, disgusting debauchery into EVERY frame, every scene, over and over again, and they will eat it up as if there was something there. But there is nothing there. There is no real story, no real character development, no real reason to watch these immoral characters indulge themselves. I truly felt traumatized, and with no that reason I could see.Unless you love porn, and senseless violence on every level, don't go see this movie. You deserve better."
tt0816692,"I am sorry but found this movie to be highly over rated. It was high on visual effects but low on the content in terms of script, story and the future of the world basically.I am sure it will grab few awards in these categories.There was a similar hype around Avatar but when I saw Avatar, it had something new to offer. Interstellar doesn't offer anything new as such.If you put the movie Gravity and the movie Frequency together in 5D, wormhole angle, you have Intersetllar.In fact I found Frequency to be highly underrated movie.Acting/Direction is good but wished the script were much more stronger."
tt0468569,"I know this review will get a bunch of unhelpful votes but somebody has to tell the truth here! The Dark Knight is wildly overrated and is the most overrated movie of all time. Forget Titanic, Boondock Saints and King Kong(2005). This movie surpasses them when it comes to sheer hype. For the record I love Batman Begins. I thought it was a fresh beginning on a series that was rendered ineffective by that lunatic Joel Schumacher. Christian Bale fared well as both Batman and Bruce Wayne and the rest of the cast did a great job also. But this movie.... Everything that made Batman Begins so great is absent from this pretentious slop. Most of the cast look like they'd rather be somewhere else. Let me break it down this way with what stinks about this movie.The plot: Idiotic beyond belief. Joker(Heath Ledger) plans to kill city officials while playing childish games with Batman. Most of the time he's killing the people he's aligned with making him the most moronic villain in superhero movie history. Batman joins forces with Commissioner Gordon to stop him.The acting: Christian Bale is wooden in both roles(Batman and Bruce Wayne). He spends most of the movie looking like he's stoned out of his mind. And what is up with that voice? In Batman Begins he sounded cool like one of the gangsters from those old 1940s flicks. Here he sounds like Dirty Harry with strep throat. Aaron Eckhart is flat as both Harvey Dent and Two-Face. While his Two-Face was better than Tommy Lee's Two-Face looking good by default is never good. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman sleepwalk through this whole movie. Maggie Gyllenhaal is quite awful as Rachel Dawes. Katie Holme's Rachel Dawes was a strong willed lawyer that fought for what's right. Maggie's Rachel Dawes needs to grow up and find some better priorities. I agree that she is a step up from Katie Holmes but she plays Rachel Dawes like some silly high school girl with a pathetic crush on Bruce Wayne. The fact that we are asked to feel sympathy for her when The Joker captures her is a bit of a stretch. Her getting roasted made my day though lol!Now for the talk of the town: Heath Ledger as Joker. Heath Ledger's performance was okay but to say that he was better than Jack Nicholson's Joker is hilarious to say the least. Jack Nicholson's Joker had style, a plan and was pretty funny as well as unpredictable. Of course he was silly but he was fun. Heath Ledger's Joker is predictable with no back story and had no real plan. Just random acts of chaos. Ra's Al Ghul had a plan, The Joker of Batman 1989 had a plan, The Penguin of Batman Returns had a plan. This weirdo had nothing but bluff. Plus he's has no fun with what he does and spends most of the time ridiculously philosophizing like those corny emo-goth kids that smoke copious amounts of cigarettes while yapping about the misery of their lives. You complete me? That's about as cheesy as the Tumbler turning into a crappy motorcycle. Speaking of Emo-Goth kids that exactly what this Joker is. Only people actually find him cool instead of pathetic.Action sequences: predictable to a fault. Car chase and fights scenes plus they are quite unrealistic. People get punched, kicked, shot, bitten by dogs and knocked around by explosions and walk away without bumps, bruises, cuts or blood. Now, Im not a gore hound but if you get shot or bitten by a dog, I would expect to see some blood. Not in the Dark Knight though.Pacing: The movie builds up a pace to slow it down after wards and with all the action on the screen the movie still finds time to be boring. Plus at 2 hours and 32 minutes this movie feels longer than it needs to be. Various subplots that never connect best describe most of this movie.Conclusion: The Dark Knight is the most overrated, most hypocritical, most pretentious piece of garbage in the history of cinema. The only people that would like this are the fanboys and I cant believe that people are trouncing Tim Burton's Batman movies to foam at the mouth like rabid dog groupies over this overcooked sequel. You pseudo-intellectual snobs don't seem to realize that those movies were great for the time they were made in and they were fun. Tim Burton made the type of Batman movie he wanted to make without trying to please these shills. I must have seen the Tim Burton Batman movies more times than I can count and still have a ball watching them till this day. I saw this dreck three times and still couldn't get into it. Its not even fun. Its a plodding mess that gets more hype than it deserves. Matter of fact, I'll tell how much I didn't like it. For months I had The Dark Knight on my computer for free via z-share and when my computer suffered from a virus that force me to erase the whole thing, this was the only movie through z-share that I never tried to get back. That should tell you everything you need to know about my feelings on this movie. Two Thumbs down."
tt1375666,"For a film of this kind to work there are (at the very least) three script-writing requirements: a) internal logic, b) characters with depth, and c) the complete omission of wise-a*s gimmickry.The film fails on all three counts.I liked the avalanche; I liked the freight train. I laughed at the Kubrick tributes. Beyond that, the thing was too simple for words - but dressed up to be a deep and meaningful experience. You know you are watching a loser when an elevator takes you up and down the guy's consciousness. An elevator? Now who dreamed that up?World domination? A Japanese accent that is unintelligible? Cartoonish characters of all shades (to sell tickets?) Two female leads, one of whom is frighteningly out of whack with the film's storyline (she doesn't understand anything, but is designing the project!), and the other wandering through scenes meant to be scary but - hey, you need to be able to act first, and it would help to then act scary.This film is a mess - except for the avalanche and freight train."
tt1130884,"I am unsure of where all the reviews are coming from, I saw several people in the same screening as mine with the same opinion as mine - terrible/waste of money.The movie has been absolutely hammered with marketing which in general means it is a terrible movie. This is certainly the case here. It plays out like a D- story written in junior high, ending with, he woke up and it was all a dream. The ending didn't flow whatsoever with any of the movie, came across like the director wanted to finish early for his summer vacation.I won't even rate the first 90% of the movie as the ending ruins the entire thing and I wouldn't recommend seeing this to anyone, PATHETIC.Martin Scorsese - Shutter Island Grading - D-"
tt0120815,"Count me among the group of dissenters that thinks ""Saving Private Ryan"" is 20 minutes of technically expert film-making capped by 140 minutes of monotonous war film punctuated by treacly and typical Spielbergian emotional histrionics.Spielberg's attempts at meticulously recreating the Omaha Beach invasion that take up the first half hour or so of this film are stunning. But the film grinds to a halt after that with a lame story and shallow characters that go nowhere. Spielberg wants us all to feel guilty (doesn't he always) about what soldiers in WWII went through, but his way to do that is to throw brutal violence in our faces every few minutes. The thing is, it's not the violence that makes other and better war films bring home the horrors of war to its audience; it's the depiction of what war does to a man's psyche. It's another film from 1998 set during WWII combat, Terence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line,"" that stands as the year's masterpiece about war. But audiences ignored that film because Malick wasn't willing to hold their hands and tell them how they should feel, something Spielberg could teach a class in.Grade: B"
tt0120815,"This movie grabbed a hold of me so tight i could barely breathe, and just Steven Spielberg just shows once again to win the best direting adacemy award for this movie.I love how the movie just took you right into the heart of war. The action was tense, and the plots are amazing."
tt0133093,"You sit and wonder... when is something going to happen? You wait and wait... So the story starts in de first part by giving you a different view on the world we live in (which we are not aware of...interesting). After you realise this the movie just crashes. The screenwriter obviously had no idea where to go from this point on and slows the story down. There is some action which leads to nowhere. The story doesn't progress and you're just waiting for the story to start and progress. The main reason you would want to see this movie is because of the special effects and at some points a lot of action is going on but... the story isn't going anywhere which makes you feel like the movie just goes on and on and on... In the end I felt that its a shame, because a good idea got slaughtered by a bad screenwriter. I gave 2 point just for the idea."
tt0172495,"GLADIATOR is a masterpiece of polished pulp Cinema with all the right ingredients: visceral fights and battles; a beautiful, mysterious woman; a villain you love to hate and a hero with a code of honor (and arms like tree trunks); it has all the drama and heartbreaking betrayals and tragic deaths of a Telenovela and as much blood and testosterone as you'd find in a Rambo movie. It's simply glorious, spectacularly entertaining filmmaking - all delivered straight to the gut and without a shred of irony.And boy is this violent revenge tale and journey to ancient Rome beautiful to look at: every shot is framed like a painting; it's one of those gorgeous looking Ridley Scott films where every landscape becomes as much a protagonist of the film as the actors in it. As for those actors, they are never less than magnetic to watch, and especially Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe stand out; they bring an intensity and all-in approach to their roles that garnered them both Oscar nominations (Crowe won his).I sometimes hear the argument by certain self-professed film critics that GLADIATOR is too pulpy to really be considered a good film. I couldn't agree less. This is one rousing adventure and one beautiful movie with a fantastic cast - and it knows exactly what it wants, and it achieves it to a degree of perfection. It's about as cinematic an experience as film can offer, and it's as watchable today as it was nearly 20 years ago.P.S.

tt0172495,"I am usually worried that I'm in for a big let-down when I am looking forward to a film as much as I was to this one.  This time however, I was very pleasantly suprised, when Gladiator not only fulfilled but surpassed my expectations.  It's a brilliant film, which (while containing weaknesses such as a script which wasn't quite as good as it could have been, and one climactic scene which completely changes, and ruins, the ending) manages to engage your heart and mind.The performances are without exception excellent (although the accents may distract a bit, there is such a wide variety of them).  I must single out for commendation Mr. Phoenix, who despite his youth manages to portray a character with such conviction that you never for a moment doubt his interpretation.  His physical performance is as good as his mental one.The film rests firmly on the (extremely attractive and capable) shoulders of one Russell Crowe.  In a tour-de-force performance, he manages to convey a man (not a superhuman) with frailties and doubts and fears and heart.  I cannot convey to you how brilliant this man's performance was.  If anyone else had been this character, the film would have rated at best a five out of ten.Kudos to Russell Crowe, and to Ridley Scott, for managing to keep this film on a level with humanity, rather than one in which the characters become killing machines.A must see, five stars out of five."
tt0109842,"Fresh is a stunningly original story, that at first seems merely some sort of ordinary, ugly gangster/drug pusher flick -- but that is just the setting. Half way through the film the story shifts, its disparate elements come together, and you realize that everything has been very carefully laid out. The script is intelligent, the acting superb, the direction sublime.You can watch the film come together time and again, with fascination. One of the ten best films of the decade."
tt0120737,"This review addresses all three movies that strictly speaking do not form a trilogy since they are connected, the same way Tolkien's opus was a single novel published in three volumes, each comprising two ""Books"". To simplify, the works are referenced by the following acronyms: FR (The Fellowship of the Ring), TT (The Two Towers), RK (The Return of the King).THE QUALITIESThe movies are visually impressive and do not seem long despite running for a total of 9h20 (11h30 in the extended version that is not discussed here). Pacing is sustained, maybe too much, yet does allow slow scenes as in the Shire, Rivendell and Lothlorien. Within this logic, rhythm is more credible: the 17 years between Gandalf leaving the Shire and returning feel much shorter (FR); Frodo leaves immediately after Gandalf does whilst in the novel it takes months (FR).The selection of scenes is adequate. Due to length several were omitted which triggered criticism, notably the part with Tom Bombadil (FR) or Saruman trying to outsmart Sauron (TT), but they are not very important losses. The scouring of the Shire and Saruman's death at the end of RK are discarded because it is anticlimactic, albeit meaningful since the Hobbits are transformed by their journey and Frodo rejects violence. Also, the movies essentially omit Tolkien's numerous songs and poems which is a good point: they would have been awkward on screen especially since they are not pieces of superlative literature.The structure is revised arguably for the better: Tolkien focuses during several chapters on selected characters, intentionally leaving the reader in expectation regarding others for a long time (TT, RK). Here scenes alternate hence the viewer is permanently updated, since it would be difficult in cinema to grasp the concomitance of plots that can be outlined in writing. The movies also move explanations to prologues: Sauron and the Rings of Power, for immediate clarity (FR); how Smeagol took the Ring, for substance (RK). Last, endings differ from the Books to limit cliffhangers which seems paradoxical yet makes sense for films released over three years: the Orcs' attack is moved from the beginning of TT to the end of FR, avoiding a suspended action; Frodo's capture by Orcs in the mountain is moved from the end of TT to the beginning of RK.The movies illustrate some of Tolkien's themes: good vs evil, fate, duty, courage, addiction to power, environment (Saruman destroying trees), etc. Some critics have argued they are secondary, but let's be honest: so are they in the novel which includes lengthy parts with action and dialogs, seldom about metaphysics. Indeed it is difficult to combine epic and depth, ""Moby Dick"" being a notable exception. In fact the films manage to be slightly less sexist by providing additional parts to female roles: Galadriel voices the FR prologue; Arwen is more present; she rescues Frodo in FR and telepathically helps Aragorn after his fall in TT; Eowyn has a stronger personality. On the other hand, the movies preserve the traditional values of the novel: the view on races is Manichean and monarchy is glorified.The movies efficiently include elements from Tolkien's History of Middle-earth: Gandalf reading the scroll of Isildur in Minas Tirith (FR), the romance between Arwen and Aragorn, the origins of Orcs about which Tolkien's explanations varied. They also add short scenes strengthening consistency and visual impact: Elrond tells Gandalf how Isildur refused to destroy the Ring in a way different than Tolkien's, announcing Frodo's turnaround at the end of RK (FR); everyone argues at the Council of Elrond under the influence of the Ring (FR); Boromir is tempted by the Ring in the mountain (FR); Theoden's mind is possessed by Saruman instead of just being deluded by Wormtongue (TT); Aragorn convinces the spectres to join him (RK); the four Hobbits interestingly have mixed feelings after returning to the Shire (RK).Visual effects are convincing notably Frodo's vision when he wears the Ring and the bestiary, except Ents who are cartoonesque. Artefacts and sets are awesome, notably Moria, Edoras and Minas Tirith, bar some looking partly fake: parts of Rivendell, parts of Lothlorien, Mount Doom, the Grey Havens. Scenery is breathtaking to the point of being a permanent advertising for New Zealand, enhanced by several aerial shots and inserts for instance the two giant statues on river Anduin in FR. Sound effects are impressive, for example noises illustrating the power of the Ring.The soundtrack, beautifully performed by renowned orchestras, choirs and singers, is based on varied, catching and evolving leitmotifs representing characters, places and the Ring: with approximately 100 of these, it is according to Wikipedia the largest catalogue ever, surpassing that of the entire Star Wars series. The drawback is music is almost continuous so our ears do feel like a rest at times.THE LIMITSThe movies overdramatise situations even when it's not required. There is a general tendency to overact, frequently highlighted by close shots: we see a lot of frowning, intense gazing and exalted dialogues. Orcs, filmed in detail, are beyond ghastly and frequently shout instead of simply being present which would have been loathsome enough. The score sometimes adds a layer of grandiloquence. This is unfortunately a tendency in contemporary cinema to give the audience its money's worth of sound, performance, camera movements, special effects and so on. Essentially it tells us how we should feel.Characters are relatively shallow but let's be honest again: so are they in the novel where psychology is reduced and villains like Saruman, Wormtongue and Sauron are completely kept in the background which is unfortunate for the important good vs evil theme. Indeed it is difficult to combine epic and emotions, ""War and Peace"" being a notable exception together with the abovementioned. Actually the movies depict Gollum, Saruman and even Wormtongue better than the novel does. On the other hand, Frodo is mainly shown as whiny which is one-sided (the actor's youth could partly explain this): because of that and the increased focus on Aragorn, we almost feel the latter is the lead role, in contradiction with Tolkien's intention. Only at the very end do we fully empathise with Frodo's unredeemable physical and psychological traumas. As a side note, the mighty Gimli becomes a comic relief, which is acceptable to offset all the action and tension throughout.Battles are too extensive: Moria (FR), river Anduin (FR), Helm's Deep (TT), Minas Tirith (RK), the Black Gate (RK). Granted, Tolkien also describes them at length but we reach saturation earlier when watching than reading. The movies also add totally unrequired combats: Gandalf vs Saruman whilst a longer dialogue between the two wizards would have been more stimulating (FR), the gates of Moria (FR), the Wargs' attack (TT), the Ents storming Isengard (TT), the taking of Osgiliath (RK), the last two being only evoked in the novel.By contrast to the above note about purposefully added short scenes, some extra and long subplots are useless: Aragorn falls after the Wargs' attack (TT); Faramir takes Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath and the Nazgul attacks (TT); Arwen decides to leave overseas (TT) and changes her mind (RK); Frodo sends Sam away (RK).The movies do not try to clarify the novel's inconsistencies. Why only include 9 members in the Fellowship (yes there are also 9 Black Riders, so what)? What are the odds of 8 of those 9 surviving such a quest? Why do Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli choose to save two blundering Hobbits instead of continuing to help the Ring-Bearer who will decide the fate of Middle-earth (FR)? Why don't Saruman and Sauron coordinate their attacks instead of letting their enemies regroup (TT, RK)? And why does Sauron only unleash a part of his troops against Minas Tirith (RK)? If the giant eagles can defeat Nazguls, why don't they intervene at the battle of Minas Tirith (RK), and even Helm's Deep (TT)? And why don't they simply carry Frodo towards Mount Doom instead of letting him walk all the way, the same way they bring him back? There are only two exceptions: the fact four inexperienced Hobbits are allowed to join five mighty fighters on such a dangerous and essential mission is handled with humour (FR); the Black Riders altogether abandon Weathertop because Aragorn completely dominates them, which is a minor inconsistency compared to the absence of explanation (FR).-----Overall the ""Trilogy"" is technically impeccable and coherent even if Tolkien's fans could feel deceived. Despite the grandiloquence and emphasis on combat, style is realistic with great care for details:Peter Jacksonsaid he wanted his films to look like a historical account. Out of the three movies, TT is arguably slightly superior: pacing is more abated despite the long battle in Helm's Deep, that is well shot anyhow; Gollum's personality is revealed; there are beautiful sequences such as the ones involving Arwen; the atmosphere is more dreamlike in line with the novel, for instance Frodo's dream at the beginning or the Dead Marshes; the opening backward aerial shot on the mountains is compelling, as if we were leaving them with the characters.In summary ""The Two Towers"" leans more towards fantasy whilst the other two movies lean more towards action. One reason might be the former as a book is approximately 20% shorter than ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", whilst as film they both run for 3 hours: Jackson had more time to include atmospheric elements instead of just events, especially after moving two sequences as noted. ""The Return of the King"" is also shorter on paper, however despite running for 3h20 on screen is mainly focused on action with the chaotic crossing to Mordor and the lengthy battle of Minas Tirith, as well as on the epilogue (20 minutes following Frodo awaking in Minas Tirith)."
tt0167260,"How can a well-made adventure like RETURN OF THE KING beso numbingly dull?It's hard to fault the production design and special effects -- everyinch of the widescreen palate is filled with colorful imagery. Inaddition, the cast acquits itself well, even though they're stuck withstilted and annoying faux Middle English dialog. Ultimately, thewhole thing is so stiff and scripted that it comes off as lifeless,even as castles fall to the ground and thousands of creatures die.Maybe its least forgiving fault is the ending. Well, it's not quite anending, because it never ends; it's one coda after another, andsnickers could be heard from my otherwise reverent first dayaudience as the film refused to die.A great cinematic achievement? Peter Jackson's achievement isonly technical, and I'm relieved that there aren't any more volumesin the trilogy."
tt1130884,"Acting? Top notch. Cinematography? Perfect. Grotesque images? In spades. Foreboding music? You bet. Gothic atmosphere? Ooo-eee-ooo.The problem here is the story and the way it is told. I had read Dennis Lehane's novel going in and knew the basic arc of the story and the big reveal at the end, but this version stuffs way too much into a relatively simple mystery story. Shutter Island could be ... THIS! Or it could be ... THAT! Or it could be ... SOME OTHER AWFUL THING! And why do we need World War II flashbacks? What do Nazis and Holocaust victims add to the story, except to give Scorcese a chance to show mournful starving Jews, a pile of bodies topped by a heartbreaking little dead girl clutching at her dead mother and an, admittedly masterful, tracking shot of Nazis being mowed down by righteous GIs. Take that, Quentin.And here's a small annoyance. As the GIs enter what is clearly stated as Dachau concentration camp, which is in Germany, we see the famous arch that says, ""Arbeit macht frei"" (work sets you free). Trouble is, that arch isn't at Dachau, it's at Auschwitz, which is in Poland. Auschwitz was liberated by the Red Army. Why can't Scorcese leave well enough alone? Things are over amplified. You can't just show a Nazi commandant's office, it has to be full of blowing paper. You can't just have stormy weather, it has to be a raging hurricane. You can't just show a woman living in a cave, you have to be sure we see the canned rations and canteen of water that keep her alive. Things to marvel at, for sure, but ultimately distracting.After a while, it's hard to tell when U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leo DiCaprio) is hallucinating and when he is not. In one scene, he wakes up from a bad dream and immediately begins hallucinating ... or is it more of the bad dream? Hmm. One can almost hear Scorcese say, ""Hey, let's not just blow up a car, let's put Teddy's hallucinated wife and daughter into the explosion!"" Taken together, these things cause a lot of suspense to drain out of the movie and it ends up being a gorgeously made creep-out flick."
tt1375666,"This review is being written by a 46 year-old guy. I mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important, as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie more--and can take the fast-paced action and frenetic pace. I assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film. Just something to consider as you read this.As for the movie, I'll be up front about the fact that I did NOT love this film. It's just not the sort of movie I'd usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go. I am glad I did, however, as I really could respect the movie in many ways. First, the story is wildly original (though, also quite confusing). Other than the Matrix films, I can't think of anything that even comes close to it in style. Second, the production looked and sounded great. The music was intense and worked great with the amazing, totally amazing, special effects. Third, it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they are NOT light-weights and could act. Leonardo DiCaprio."
tt0993846,"Why Leonardo DiCaprio didn't win the Oscar for best actor, I will never understand. Matthew McConaughey must have put on an absolutely indescribable performance in Dallas Buyers Club. I have yet to see Dallas Buyers Club, so I can't say Matthew didn't deserve it.The Wolf of Wall Street is insane though! It is a very well directed movie by my favorite director of all time, Martin Scorsese. This movie shows what it was like as a stockbroker in a very unique way as a comedy. However, if it wasn't a comedy, it would be a very boring movie. Well done by the writers.This is definitely my favorite movie of all time now. Even at 3 hours long, I wish the movie continued. I would recommend seeing it, but children should NOT see this movie."
tt0372784,"Last night, I went to check out Batman Begins, and I only have one word for the tone of this film: perfect.Absolutey nailed. Blasted out the park. A grand slam.The folks responsible for this adaptation of the Dark Knight simply ""got it."" 100%.Batman is a persona that was created to inspire fear into the hearts of criminals. A creature of the night that hunts from the shadows, strikes without warning, and vanishes into the darkness like a nightmare. The character is never meant to be seen by the general public, he is merely meant to exist in their whispers, an urban myth that is talked about in hushed tones throughout Gotham City.Batman does not have a ""Bat Credit Card"", and he doesn't attend charity auctions or d√©butante balls. He doesn't drive around the city streets in the Batmobile in broad daylight, waving to cheering citizens. He doesn't have a ""Bat Phone"" that connects him to the commissioner. He doesn't wear a costume with rubber nipples or operate vehicles with spinning neon turbine engines and open cockpits. He doesn't crack jokes like, ""It's the car, right? Chicks dig the car."" All of these things are wrong, wrong, WRONG...and this movie understands that. It understands that and washes all of these injustices away until they are nothing more than a faded bad memory. Screenwriter David Goyer and director Christopher Nolan have given us a film that treats the character with respect; a loud, thrilling masterpiece that doesn't insult your intelligence or bombard you with inappropriate campy antics.Christian Bale gives us a Batman that will scare the living crap out of you. His voice is a gravelly, menacing sound, and when he yells at some poor schmuck to get some information, it's downright terrifying. He swoops out of darkened alleys, hitting fast and furious. He's brutal, cold, and calculating. In short, he's everything that anybody who ever put that cape and cowl on is not. Perfection.The villains are also amazing, but a huge part of their contributions to the overall brilliance of the film is their failure to dominate it. The previous Batman movies were plagued by these cackling idiots in ludicrous costumes who pushed Batman to the back burner. In Batman Begins, we finally get to spend some time with the hero, learning who he really is behind the mask.Not to imply that the villains are poorly fleshed out or inconsequential to the story - quite the opposite in fact. Cillian Murphy is a very effective Scarecrow, turning in a subdued, but intensely creepy performance as a warped psychiatrist who uses fear gas on his victims, unleashing horrifying hallucinations. Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) is a shadowy Tibetian criminal warlord named Ra's Al Ghul, who watches over young Bruce Wayne's training with Ducard, played by Liam Neeson. But things are not what they appear with this situation, and a shocking twist comes into play towards the climax. The rest of the cast is solid, especially Gary Oldman, who finally gives us a competent, intelligent James Gordon. Essentially, the movie is about fear. Confronting it, learning from it, using it, and conquering it. It's a dark, serious film that leaves little room for humor, but some sneaks through in the form of some witty exchanges between loyal butler Alfred (a brilliant Michael Caine), and Bruce Wayne.This movie is awesome and a complete triumph for DC, Warner Brothers, Nolan, and everyone else involved.. Run, don't walk, to the theater. Amazing."
tt0114369,"Where did this film go wrong?It splits into 2 parts: Good and very bad.The first 3\4's is good. Brad Pitt puts on an acting display that is less wooden than usual and Morgan Freeman puts on his usual thoughtful guy role. It's not Crazy Joe Clark from Lean on Me, but it's a decent role. Kevin Spacey has the best part, but that's cause he's a nutbag. Pitt and Freeman are on the trail of a serial killer who keeps leaving clues in the style of the 7 deadly sins. It's an intruiging plot that has many odd and nasty characters and scenes that are worth watching.Then comes the end. Brad Pitt's acting falls apart. I would swear that he had just gotten up and read the script 5 minutes before filming. I don't really want to say what happens because that kills the film and I'm not that kind of guy. Let's just say that Pitt walks into a situation that would make the strongest person fall apart. The emotion level should be beyond what humans would normally feel everday. It's horrible. And yet, he acts as if he already knows is like 'Oh man, that's bad. doughnut anyone?' It doesn't help that I figured out the end way before it came up, but I lost any thought of Pitt coming into his own as an actor. See the film, judge it for yourself."
tt0167261,"Perhaps my judgment is a bit skewed, having camped out 30 hours for the premier of this movie and expecting to see the gates of heaven open up as soon as they turned on the projectors (I had high expectations of this film), But I think that Peter Jackson should be shot repeatedly with a BB gun for what he did to Tolkien's masterpiece.  I mean, even in the first movie when he left out Tom Bombadil I could understand the reasoning.  But if you're going to cut something for reasons of time, DON'T ADD ANYTHING! Everything that was added to this movie was total crap from an oliphaunt's ass.  Any true fan of Tolkien should be incensed at the utter butchering of the story.  I could go into examples, but I'm sorta strapped for time currently, and I'm sure they've been discussed at length here (I'm a little late, but I just registered here, so... well you know).  The only redeeming qualities were the first 10 minutes, and the way they did gollum (although the portrayal of the character was more humourous than it should have been).All this being said...  I'll probably end up buying the 4-disc special edition DVD and camping out overnight in preparation for Return of the King...  :)"
tt0167261,"The awesomeness of the Battle of Helms Deep, plus the real introduction of Gollum/Smeagol (my favorite character in the series) makes this better than the first in my opinion."
tt0110912,"I must be one of the few individuals on this planet that totally detested this film. I left the cinema feeling extremely ill. I went along to this film on the recommendation that it was highly amusing but I guess their idea of ""humour"" isn't quite the same as mine.Sure, it had some clever moments but why belabour the point."
tt1130884,My favourite film of all time. I could watch it 100+ times and never be bored.
tt0480025,"A story about a young boy called Shaun growing up in the 80's, dealing with his dads death and bullies he befriends a group of skinheads who take him in and show him the world of drink, girls and drugs. One of the gangs (Woody) mates has just came out of prison and decides to rally the boys together to form a nationalist gang. This gang want nothing but to have only English people in England. Shaun then witnesses events that will scar him for life. He has a love interest called Smell (Michelle rhymes with Smell doesn't it?) The story is based on director Shane Meadows own experiences growing up.Overall it is a brilliant film with some harsh reality thrown into the mix. I give it a very well deserving 10 out of 10. Bravo Shane Meadows."
tt0848228,"The Avengers, a superhero symphony that had me fist-pumping like a Marvel fanatic. The ensemble cast, from Robert Downey Jr.'s snarky Tony Stark to Scarlett Johansson's kick-ass Black Widow, is a powerhouse of charisma and chemistry, each hero shining in their own right. The film editing is a whirlwind of action, seamlessly interweaving larger-than-life battles with character-driven moments that give the narrative heart. Strengths? The seamless blending of individual hero stories into a cohesive team dynamic, a superhero jigsaw puzzle that fits together flawlessly. Weaknesses? Occasionally, the plot might hover on the edge of over-the-top, but hey, it's a superhero extravaganza, and we love it that way. The music, Alan Silvestri's score, is the pulse of heroism, swelling with each iconic entrance and saving the world crescendo. Cinematography captures the grandeur of the Marvel universe, from the soaring heights of Stark Tower to the depths of Loki's mischief. The message? A celebration of teamwork, diversity, and the idea that even the most disparate heroes can come together for the greater good. 8/10 is a superhero salute to its exhilarating entertainment, a film that not only assembles Earth's mightiest heroes but also assembles a solid spot in the pantheon of superhero epics."
tt0120737,"Barely ever hearing of The Lord of the Rings, I went in to see this film in theaters the consecutive Friday it was released, to not only be flabbergasted at its greatness, but wanting more! Since then, I devoted myself to seeing the following two films on the first day of release -- a promise I kept.Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece not only carries a great deal of the text to full film fruition, but shows the power of film, and proving that nothing is impossible. Jackson's vision is continuous, and never seems to loose grasp of the story that is being told. Using the artistry of John Howe and Alan Lee, The Fellowship of the Ring gleams with a beautiful and dark atmosphere, a length of detail that makes it seem like everyone and everything has its own history, and full of wondrous images one could never imagine.The acting is superb. With a complex script, each actor has transformed these characters into 3-D people with deep back-story, and people that we feel compassion for. This is one extraordinary ensemble cast. Each actor IS that character, making it seem impossible to imagine anyone else fill that person's shoe in their stead. Viggo Mortensen IS Aragorn. Sir Ian McKellen IS Gandalf the Grey. Elijah Wood IS Frodo Baggins. One could weep with our heroes should one fall, or feel inspired when they achieve victory. A fantasy with this much emotion just seems surreal, but it's completely believable.Never losing pace, the writing and direction is flawless, making for one enthralling introduction into Middle-earth. The voice over prologue fills even the most uneducated audience member with all the necessary knowledge they need to know in order to understand our heroes' and villains' motives. Some things of course have been omitted for pacing reasons. While not present in the theatrical cut, we do see the passing of the Grey Elves, and get a brief tale of Beren and Luthien. The barrow-wights and their story is no where to be seen (as interesting as it is in the book, there really is no place for it in this film) and Tom Bombadil is absent as well, but thankfully to the ingeniousness of the writers, in the Extended Edition of The Two Towers a little homage is paid to the character. Omissions and changes are always part of adapting a book to film, and the ones made by Peter Jackson, Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh are justifiable in every way.The action scenes are spaced out thoroughly enough for breathing room, plot advancement, and ever-continuing character development. Each action scene is its own, be it the flight to the Fjords of Bruinen, the Mines of Moria, or the showdown at Amon Hen near the end of the film. All are greatly choreographed, each stunt member and actor is full of energy and ambition as they wield deadly weapons at each others' heads and limbs. It really is a sight to behold.The special effects are mesmerizing. The use of CGI, miniatures/bigatures, and even clever camera angles blend to make one ideal image after the other. The soaring images of Barad-dur or Orthanc seem real when in fact, they only stand so many feet high. The Argonath, two figures of enormous height standing before the Anduin River seem like 300 foot creations, when in fact they are about only several feet off the ground. Simply jaw-dropping imagery.Howard Shore's score for The Fellowship of the Ring is a beautiful, epic, and complex piece of work that makes one feel like they have been entranced. Even when some of the text seems omitted from the screen, it can be heard through the powerful instrumentation conducted and created by this composer. The use of leitmotifs to symbolize a country, race, or character is stunning.Overall, The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring is a visionary masterpiece, allowing the world to see what seems like actual history with fantastic elements, equaling the greatness of Hollywood's earlier classics. As the first of three, one who has not seen these films can await the next several hours of their lives to be changed for ever."
tt0372784,"A nice effort, I suppose, but a failure nonetheless. I actually prefer the first three installments of the 1980s & 1990s Batman franchise, though none of them are great movies, either. Tim Burton ¬ñ and even Joel Schumacher ¬ñ brought at least some vision into their Batman worlds. Nolan attempts to do this realistically ¬ñ that was the original idea, anyway ¬ñ but he is bogged down by screen writing and action movie clich√©s. There weren't half as many explosions in all four of the 90s Batman films combined. Batman Begins does little to deepen the story, as some critics have claimed. The backstory was told perfectly, and with great economy, in 1989's Batman. There was no emotion lost. Nolan takes nearly an hour to tell it, and he doesn't make it any more interesting. They didn't find a better actor to play Batman. Christian Bale is as dull as Keaton, Kilmer, and Clooney. The villains are uninteresting. Ra's Al Ghul (which is mispronounced throughout the film) has always been my least favorite of the Batman villains. Dr. Jonathan Crane, aka ""the Scarecrow"" is wonderfully played by Cillian Murphy when he's out of his mask, but he is supremely uninteresting when he's in it (doesn't help that Nolan resorts to stupid distorted images and noise pollution whenever he puts the mask on). Katie Holmes is a wonderful actress in small projects, but, like Natalie Portman, she doesn't translate well to blockbusters. Plus, Tom Cruise just ruined her for me. Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkinson are horribly miscast (Wilkinson as a mob boss?). They actually might have just switched roles and it would have been better. The only things the film gets excessively right are Alfred and Lucius Fox, played by Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman. But, really, while these two consummate actors bring an air of class to this kiddy pool, they out-act both the hero and the villains to such an extent that it warps the movie. I really should not desire more scenes with the butler. I should add Liam Neeson to that, as well. He's very good, and perfectly cast. Batman Begins is often a good actioner, but it should have been much better."
tt0114369,"This is one of those dark movies, where it's constantly raining and wet and where the light always seems to be dim. Appropriately enough, this changes to bright and shimmering heat in the very end. As a kid, I hated dark movies. But perhaps it is appropriate in this case, because Seven attempts to be a statement about humanity: no one is without sin.The seven deadly sins are gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and wrath. Prime examples of people committing these are being punished one by one, brutally and efficiently, by a psychopathic killer. Detectives, and reluctant partners, William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and David Mills (Brad Pitt) are assigned to track down the killer. Needless to say, the job gets accomplished. While some might argue it is done surprisingly, I'd argue otherwise.For once, I wasn't impressed with Pitt's acting. I thought Freeman did a great job. As usual, the villain, John Doe played by Kevin Spacey, provides a chilling performance, even though he is not given as much center stage as, say, Anthony Hopkins was in Silence of the Lambs. In fact, the whole movie seems to hurry through without giving key characters enough time to build up their emotional worth, particularly Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow).In the end, Seven does manage to get its point across effectively. While watching the movie itself, I thought it a bit anti-climatic, but when mulling it over later, the images echo very strongly in my mind. One of the most disturbing films I've seen."
tt0068646,"After all the hype people have given this movie and the fact it won Best Picture confuses me.Most of it was just people sitting around talking. There were some good actiony scenes but they are few and far between, aside from Sonny's sister flipping her lid and smashing up the house, followed by the famous tollbooth scene a few minutes later.Speaking of the house-smashing scene, it's meant to be dramatic but I burst out laughing, but that's just my morbid sense of humor.Maybe I'm just not ""getting it"" and my head is up where the sun doesn't shine, but this movie was just...... kinda boring for me."
tt1130884,"I just saw Shutter Island this evening, just prior to its American release. I have to say this film was full of intrigue. Prior to viewing this film I had built a preconceived notion of what this thriller was going to be like because I was fooled yet again by good marketing when watching the trailer. This is probably not the movie for your average film-goer who wants an easy plot line to follow and little thought required. This movie does challenge the viewer physchologically and definitely holds your attention all the way through. For someone who was never much of a Leonardo fan, his performance is brilliant, so much range to his character. In fact all of the acting in this film is excellent. The directing is probably the best quality to this film. I always enjoy watching a film that is as unpredicatable as this film and where the director has turned the plot line on to his viewer."
tt0120737,"Beautiful environments with lovely costumes combined with superb characters and and an intense story...the result: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.Don't let the 3 hour + running time scare you of, like so many long movies it's very well worth seeing. Never has a fantasy world looked so realistic as in Lord of the Rings. All the sets are very detailed and have a realistic feeling as well as the characters and the different races of Middle Earth.The greatest strength of this movie is not the story itself. The story itself is actually pretty simple, basically it's just about the Ring and the quest to destroy it. No, the greatest strength are the characters, the look of Middle Earth and the action sequences. Rarely has an adventure movie looked so good and has been so tense and enjoyable to watch.But let's not over praise it, the movie has it flaws and weak spots. There are some unnecessary and boring scene's (especially in the Extended Edition) but for an 3 hour + movie that's maybe just unavoidable. And no matter how awesome everything looks, the special effects aren't always top-class, I'm a firm believer that the movie would have been better if ILM provided the special effects. But let's not judge the movie for what it could have been but let's judge it for what it is. Also, sometimes the Hobbits (Sam, Pippin and Merry) are border line irritating. Another thing that disturbed me was the editing, in my opinion it was extremely bad done in some of the scene's (For instance in the wizards battle between Gandalf and Saruman) but having some editing experience myself I might pay extra attention to this things...But in this case all those flaws and weak spots are forgiven, for The Fellowship of the Ring truly is a wonderful movie that you simply must have seen at least once in your life.Already a classic!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
tt0109830,"This is a powerful yet charming movie; fun for its special effects and profound in how it keeps you thinking long after it's over. Like others, I've seen this movie more than once. One comment I've never heard is that Forrest's simplicity is almost zen-like. I should read the novel to get the author's intention (I remember some people preferring the book and complaining that no one at the Academy Awards gave him any credit.) But rather than an implication that you should do what you're supposed to do and believe in God and you'll win in the end, I see it as zen-like, i.e., living in the moment and not having expectations or particular cravings (other than his loving Jenny.) So he ends up just stumbling into all the major historical events of the time. Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn't have the brains to think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of our problems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. We love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the moment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both. It is something to mull over for a long time."
tt1375666,"Don't get me wrong, Christopher Nolan (writer, producer and director of this movie) is a very, very talented filmmaker. He will undoubtedly make that masterpiece for which he will be remembered. But that's just my point: he hasn't made it yet. The Dark Knight wasn't it and Inception certainly isn't it. Inception is a product of a director who has been given carte blanche. His vision has been put on film without someone ever saying: 'Chris, that's not going to work.' For that matter, Inception should have been Nolan's Heaven's Gate. But Inception will probably make Nolan a even bigger star. He better check his totem¬Ö I felt compelled to write a review when I found out this movie had a 9.2 rating and a 3rd place overall in the top 250. Let me say: that is ridiculous. To balance the scale, I have rated this movie (a ridiculous) 1. I agree with some posts on the message board of IMDb: complex does not mean intellectual or smart. And for that matter, I don't think this film is very complex. It just asks what most movies do: go with it.DiCaprio gives a pretty good performance (with leftovers from his role in Shutter Island) as Dobbs, a person who is able the penetrate someone's dream and see or steal his secrets. Recently Dobbs lost his wife and he has not seen his children in a long time. That is because the authorities think he has something to do with his wife's death. Watanabe gives Dobbs a chance to get his life back. He needs to plant an idea (inception) in the mind of a competitor. Like a seed, it will grow. And the inspiration for the idea will seem real.One of the problems for me with the movie was that the dreamworld felt pretty flat and boring to me. Unlike The Matrix (a inception for this movie), the inhabitants of the other world do not bend the rules of gravity. The laws of physics do apply. That's not a bad decision. But I agree with one reviewer: 'Nolan's dreamworld looks like a mediocre action film from the 90's.' The bad guys walk around like video game characters with an AI set on level Easy. I almost shouted in the theater when Eames went Rambo in the snow scene. I understand the decision. Look at The Cell to see how wrong you can go if you explore the subconscious on film. But still, for me his decision to keep the dreamworld neat and clean is a cop out. Dreams don't look like this. Hopes, fears and experiences mix with (the conception of) the real world and you get a pretty original result sometimes. None of this in Inception. Oh right, the architect is in control. How convenient¬Ö The whole dream within a dream concept was a little far-fetched for me. Have you ever had one? Probably not. So why, when you have a pretty basic dreamworld go with a concept this unreal? The real world does influence the dream the character's have. But they feel it and are conscious that it is the real world. That's a missed opportunity. A dream influenced by factor's unknown to the dreamer could have made it much more enjoyable for the audience.Maybe it's just not my cup of tea. Like Nolan's former projects The Prestige and The Dark Knight: I don't get all the hoopla. Yes, these movies (like Inception) are well made. They are original, have refreshing ideas, are technically good and have decent scripts. But they are not the best of the decade. And this one really is not a 9.2. I'd say a 5.5. Barely..."
tt0993846,To illustrate I'm no prude I confess I've prob done more drugs that the lot of em. But this film was disgusting. Doing hookers in front of everyone the absurd frat boy raucous testosterone fuelled crap. This film annoyed me from the first five mins to the bitter end. You don't need to be of a sensitive disposition for this film to offend you as it's so extreme it put my debauched life into a shadow. Ugh just ugh.
tt1130884,"Leonardo Dicaprio stars as a U.S. Marshal sent to a remote and forbidding insane asylum in 1954 to investigate the disappearance of a patient. As he proceeds, Teddy Daniels uncovers far more than he bargained for - or is it? In a movie in which nearly everything is actually something else, the audience is redirected too many times for this to be an effective thriller, and some gaping holes in the plot should relegate this to the dustbin in no time.We first see Marshal Daniels (Dicaprio) on the way to the island via ferry, with his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo). Immediately, we size up our protagonist: prone to seasickness, a little grizzled, possibly wrestling with inner demons. Also has a prominent band-aid on his forehead, and as we all know any time a character shows up with a bandage and no explanation, that bandage will come into play later in the movie.The asylum, Ashecliffe Hospital, is run by Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), a pipe-smoking medical reformer who nonetheless looks down his nose at everyone else. His right-hand man is the assistant warden, McPherson (John Carroll Lynch), who informs the marshals that they must surrender their guns before they can enter the grounds. Again, something this obvious means that the concept will come up later in the movie, and sure enough it does.Something doesn't quite add up about the missing patient, Rachel Solando. Solando apparently vanished from her room, barefoot, without anyone noticing, on an island. That is covered in rocky terrain. Daniels finds a note hidden under the floor tile that seems to indicate that there's an additional missing patient who's not accounted for. Further galivanting around the island simply unearths more and more facts and clues that don't make much sense. And then we find out that Daniels himself might be hiding something. He fits in very well with everyone else in this regard.The movie is appropriately shot (by Robert Richardson, who's won two Oscars): moody, unflinching, terrifying at turns, well matched to the setting. But the movie has too many problems to be wholly satisfying. During the movie, one of the characters informs Daniels that being declared insane means that anything you do afterwards can be held up as evidence of your insanity. That makes sense, of course, but the trouble is that that logic can be applied to anything in this movie as well, a sort of self-justification. I Call it lazy screen writing.And, honest to goodness, I still don't think Leonardo Dicaprio is much of an actor. His matin√©e-idol looks are already fading - he's got the head of Charlie Brown at this point - but his range hasn't really improved over the past decade or so. He seems to struggle with his reaction shots, and he doesn't have the gravitas necessary for such a heavy role. I'm supposed to believe he's a federal marshal? I'd have trouble believing he's dressed up as a marshal for Halloween. Here, he's supported by a very capable cast - particularly Kingsley, although he seems to be slumming it a bit, and Patricia Clarkson. But for the most part, his character is on his own, and Dicaprio flounders.Shutter Island is, at best, minor Scorcese, a movie that's high on mood and atmosphere but a little light on a plausible plot. There are too many moments that don't make complete sense when they happen and that can only be supported by the notion that someone - or everyone - is insane."
tt1853728,"Since Inglourious Basterds Tarantino's style has evolved and as a Tarantino fan, I am not very much glad about that. Unfortunately, Django doesn't feel like it is an old fashioned, classic Western in Tarantino style! It is rather an anti Western or a postmodern Western. I have not any problem with this directly, but for example by watching Kill Bill, you can get the taste of 80's karate or kung-fu movies, vigilante movies, by watching his friend, Robert Rodriguez's film Planet Terror, you can get the taste of horror B movies, exploitation movies etc. but you can't get the taste of spaghetti Westerns or old fashioned Westerns by watching Django unfortunately. One of the biggest problems of the movie is it doesn't take itself seriously, in other words, Tarantino doesn't take his movie seriously. The first half of the movie is pretty good, interesting, entertaining considering some little flaws, but especially the second half, the movie loses his appeal and becomes dull and even uninteresting at times. Before that, I want to mention that I couldn't buy the character Django itself. A slave who suddenly becomes a cool cowboy didn't work for me (in contrast with The Bride in Kill Bill) At the same time, I didn't think that Jamie Foxx added anything special to the character or to the film and as a cast choice, he was pretty bad. He was plain and simple without any spark like the movie itself. He couldn't an unforgettable figure in the movie and can't be even likable. Christopher Waltz was again the star of the movie, he steals the show from everybody, he was just great and he deserved that Oscar! I am sorry, but without him, the movie would have been almost unbearable for me. Di Caprio simply adds color to the movie without being a cartoonish villain. No word for Samuel L. Jackson. He is like a bulldozer in terms of acting! The movie was overly humorous at times like Basterds and I don't like that. Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and even Kill Bill were serious movies even if it has a certain amount of humor or funny moments. For example, in a scene Django wears a dress (it was blue as I remember) and as if it is made for laughs! In another scene, there is a ""mask"" argument and it is like you watch a Western parody! All those harm the movie little by little. With some postmodern touches and tricks like putting modern day songs into his movie, again, Tarantino tries to be different and the most important to surprise his audiences, to amaze his audiences, but if you ask me he fails. Instead of taking old classic elements and turning those into something modern in his hands like he did in Kill Bill, in this movie, he did something different which I would define as ""anti"". Also as said, the humor harms the seriousness of his movie. In the second half, when Di Caprio gets on the stage, unfortunately, the movie doesn't get better, just the opposite, it becomes uninterested and less exciting in comparison with the long first half. When they go to Calvin Candle's place (Di Caprio), somehow the movie lost its spark and also became less entertaining. May be it is because no ""Western"" anymore in the second half, instead a drama with lots of conversations and payoff! As said, Django is not a pure Western or a modernized Western, it is more like an anti Western or post modern Western. Welcome this ""a breath of fresh air"" choice, but in the end, it isn't a great, brilliant or that impressive film. Also I couldn't get that cinema feeling that other Tarantino movies have in this movie, especially in the second half. The another big problem of the movie was sudden, exaggerating and out of place violence scenes. After a slow paced drama, suddenly, the movie turns into an extremely bloody action movie. The blood effects were looking like red paint or a kind of superficial liquid which killed my suspension of disbelief totally. This is exciting! but also very superficial, exaggerating and out of place! I had expected some realistic, old fashioned but Tarantino style action, but couldn't find it. There is not any built up tension, no character conflict, no suspense etc. I can't say that Django was a solid or subtle film. The story editing of the film was problematic either. The movie starts like a revenge movie, but couldn't fulfill that, then it becomes a road movie for a short time, but it couldn't fulfill that either. Then, it becomes a drama, later suddenly action and it goes on. Also, the last one or two minutes of the film seemed me uninviting or subfusc. Django Unchained is Tarantino's Machete, a disappointing and uneven experience."

tt1853728,"One out of the worst money-movies these times. Quentin is keeping exterminating his own film-making; burnt out, there's little chance of recovery. He lost his innocence and the genuine investment of the real geniuses that have lived. That's it. I have already written about that not long ago; there's nothing more to do for Tarantino than to laugh his way to the bank. What a loss for all involved. I can understand that Christoph Waltz, Leonardo Di Caprio, Morgan Freeman and Jamie Foxx and many others allow themselves to become involved in the making of a new film and, perhaps, in a performance, in a project with a filmmaker who proved he was somebody... but this garbage is denigrating the art of cinematic storytelling, this is compromising the ability for the young moviegoers to never enjoy in the future any resource and representation of life. What's your name? ‚Äì Django ‚Äì Can you spell it? An exchange between Jamie Foxx and Franco Nero, the man who first played Django in 1966, a Damned Great Movie, that time has left behind, which happened, for a sterile profit-only engagement, to fit the name. Today, Quentin Tarantino is not ‚Äì and probably ever will, be able to spell 'Movie' once again ‚Äì The 'Director' is silent ‚Äì I know that, strikes Corbucci's Django."
tt0167261,"This film was such a disappointment compared to the first one... About EVERYTHING has changed from the book, and it is not for the better, that is for sure. I don't quite know where to begin:Frodo is made to look like he is totally under the rings spell, and that he does not see the treacherous nature of Gollum. But then suddenly he is himself for two seconds when discussing with Sam whether their adventure will be told in a song or story... WEIRD!Gollum is just wrong... His eyes are too cute, sort of...looks like a small baby (they are not too beautiful when they are a week or two old, to tell the truth...)Shadowfax is supposed to be the fairest horse there is; almost supernatural. In the film he is just an average horse, and not even the most beautiful horse of the film... As to Gandalf, he is supposed to look radiant and powerful, almost like a god! But he just looks like an old, tired man...The elves in Helms Deep...where did that come from!? The elves never came to the rescue in that battle!!!Faramir is reduced to a copy of his brother, something which really annoys me! And then he brings them to the city with him...?Poor Gimli is made to be a ""JarJar""...he is just this helpless, useless person that we are to laugh at. Yes, he is helpless sometimes, especially when it comes to horses. The thing with Gimli willingly going up on a horse in the film is just wrong; he's terrified of riding horses, and will only do so if he gets to sit with Legolas on his horse.Aragorn is made too much of a hero; it almost made me sick (And I am a girl!!!)Why did they have Pippin bite that brooch off his cape instead of letting him try to run away from the orcs before throwing it in the grass, like he did in the book? He doesn't seem so heroic in the film...Why did they make it look like the Ents were not interested in helping?There is so much from ""Two towers"" that is not in the film...I guess it will be coming in the next one, though, so I won't complain too much about that...There are lots of other stuff I could have mentioned here, I am sure, but I will spare you for the rest. The first film was great, but Peter, you disappointed me with this one - I hope you do a better job with number three!"
tt0120737,"Let me start by saying that I've never read the books. During my childhood I belonged to the legion that read the works of Tolkien's friend and rival, C S Lewis and the Narnia Chronicles.  They got my imaginative juices flowing and I stepped over Tolkien's work.  The films came out and I had been aware of Peter Jackson's work but with all the furore and lack of money at the time I held back from seeing it for at least two months. Eventually I watched it, enjoyed it but it didn't set me on fire.  My favourite scene, Boromir's last stand, lingered in my mind and over time the desire to see it again grew.  The DVD came out and I looked forward to sitting down with my to brother (who had not seen it) to watch again.Wow ! 2nd time around this thing blew my mind.  Whether it was because I then knew the story and could enjoy the characters and appreciate everything else I don't know but it just rocked my world.  I was like a love sick pup with a constant smile on my face enjoying every scene.  I tell you this tale to qualify my praise and make clear that I wasn't a tolkien fan from the start.Peter Jackson has opened my eyes to this world.  I don't know how faithful he's been (and I don't really care) but you can tell from the passion involved and the love heaped on this film that he takes it seriously and is not out to make a fast hollywood buck.  I purchased the normal DVD and recently got the extended version which is even more fantastic. I don't feel cheated and owning both is worth every penny.The film itself is great.  The characters are rich and full, well written and well acted.  I can't really say I have a favourite but Gimli definetly comes out better in the extended version and I am looking forward to seeing his developing friendship with the others and his painfully sweet adoration of Galadriel.  The relationship between Boromir and Aragorn is very well played, again displaying real depth and makes Boromir's sacrifice and Aragorn's renewed faith in man all the more powerful.  In fact the film deals with the whole range of human emotions and knowing that they will be developed even more over the course of the next two films just warms your heart. The action scenes are great and with real time invested in the characters you feel all the more tense and involved.  The world Jackson has created is lush and wonderful with special effects serving and enhancing but NOT dominating the story.  The musical score is perfection, complimenting the film at every turn.  Indeed my favourite scene with Boromir owes much of it's brilliance to the beautiful music that accompanies it.  I am wrapped up in this world and although desperate to see the next two am also slowly savouring the whole heady experience.  For those that haven't got it I cannot recommend the extended version enough, it takes what you love and just adds more.In summary this film is a joy to watch and Peter Jackson's direction and story telling is assured and confident.  For the first time ever I'm preparing myself to enter a theatre and observe two films without any thoughts of whether I could have done it better.  I have total confidence in Peter to deliver what I need to see and knowing his cast & crew's passion for the project I know they will deliver.  It took me time to appreciate this beauty and elevate it to my favourite all time film but sometimes you have to step back and look again to observe real genius."
tt1345836,"Chris Nolan has r-e-a-l-l-y outdone himself again this time. An amazing story that I don't even know who else could write such a treatment on the World's Greatest Detective, the crowning glory of Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.I remember I once made a joke to myself a long while ago about him that if he was going to make another movie, he would probably cast Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's respective love interests from a movie of which they BOTH starred in and worked on-- 10 Things I Hate About You.It would be ironically funny how both actors are connected to each other from working at different times with the ""holy-moly mind-blowing"" filmmaker and that the actresses that played their love interests would possibly too as well."
tt0120737,"It's possible we've become too familiar with this film and its two successors. Time, and multiple rewatching as, can cause us to forget how impossible the whole project seemed before the world saw it; we forget how strange and independent spirited parts of it are; we forget the references too and evidence of Jackson's roots in horror cinema; we forget the narrative excitement that propels a film adapted from a source that is more discursive, more of a scene-setter. Changes made from the text aid this, and the result is thrilling and wonder-inducing. It's a masterful piece of epic fantasy cinema, and the whole trilogy's place in my heart is secure."
tt1375666,"All of the complaints that I have seen about this movie were ones explaining how viewers did not understand the movie. Honestly, the movie is really simple to follow, if you pay attention. I've only seen it one time and I understood everything. Many are saying that they want to see it twice in order to grasp everything, but one viewing is enough if comprehension is all you want to get out of the second viewing. This being said, I would love to see this movie a second time. The acting is outstanding and the chemistry between the actors makes the movie so pleasant to watch. You instantly forget that these are actors. The chemistry between Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon Levitt is phenomenal. Also, Leonardo is unbelievable as always, and no one can look better in a suit. The topic is so engaging and I would recommend this movie to anyone. It has been my favorite movie so far this year, and I will definitely be purchasing it as soon as it comes out onto DVD. Spend the money, see the movie, pay attention, and everything will be great."
tt0108052,This is my all time favorite Spielberg film. Its truthful and reliable in its information and the encounter's at which takes place. I love the dedication to research and the intricate details in the film and how it was put together. This film will make anyone appreciate that which we all take for granted everyday... LIFE
tt0251677,"Cuban Blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way. I actually watched it while sailing around Cuba on a western Caribbean cruise. It details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end, when the Socialist regime came and took the property of the boy's father. The majority of the film is the boy's coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to. A class A film with fine acting and directing. This is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists. It is a film about people and their lives, their mistakes, and their triumphs. A good film worth watching several times annually."
tt0167260,"I would venture to say that the Godfather underrated compared to how overrated Peter Jackson's drag-fest is. Despite an intriguing concept and decent writing, ROTK manages to put casual viewers and appreciators of good movies to a deep sleep, but it tantalizes all the senses of a good Lord of the Rings geek because it never wants itself to end. Jackson goes over the edge with his third installment, mimicking the mud and molasses pace of the Fellowship. There is something about the ending for the Return of the King that everyone should know before they see it, THERE IS NONE! The final half hour felt like the editors lost the scissors and couldn't make use of the term ""cutting-room-floor."" My score and recommendation would have definitely increased if not for the sluggish tempo. As a fan of the Two Towers, I was thoroughly disappointed when i learned that i wanted the movie to be over a mere 45 minutes into it. The Two Towers is a great story where everything comes together and everything has a point. The Return of the King is loaded with useless side stories and mediocre acting.If you're a hardcore fantasy world nut who likes to pretend that you are 2 feet tall and living in a hut somewhere or you have a long white hair with a long white robe or if you're just a fan of Orlando Bloom, then check out The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. If you don't have a year to spend and you want creative writing, great acting, and incredible personality, then pick up Se7en, Donnie Darko, Requiem for a Dream, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Pulp Fiction, ANYTHING. FOR GOD'S SAKES, THE NINJA TURTLE MOVIE IS MORE ENTERTAINING!"
tt1345836,"Sacrificed Man City v Spurs to watch this rubbish because the IMDB rating was so good.... This is my first review, and the disappointment compelled me to leave my take. Weak characters, weak plot relying on a star studded cast to get it through, I must admit I only watched an hour but honestly couldn't take any more.... Just to add to.... the continual background music does nothing for the film. It's the only one of the trilogy I have watched and defo won't be watching the other two. I grew up with Batman in the 70's and also watched the earlier films in the franchise so it's not as if I'm not a Batman fan because I was üëéüèª"
tt0111161,"Frank Darabont's ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a film of pretentious platitudes and obvious intentions.  Based on Stephen  King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"", the film stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a banker wrongly accused of murdering his adulterous wife and her lover.  Morgan Freeman delivers a much-deserved Academy-Award nominated performance as the hardened Red, the convict responsible for smuggling cigarettes into the penitentiary whose genuine depth allows him to form a friendship with Andy not based on the macho rules of the prison yard (Andy's demeanor is in face so falsely naive that many of the prisoners bet on him to be the first under pressure) but on a continuing sense of willpower and motivation in a place that genuinely lacks the atmosphere for such human emotions.And yet whereas ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is in itself an honorable predilection of prison life and shows an understanding of the human spirit which is somehow lacking in the more recent prison movies (most notably Tom Selleck's ""An Innocent Man"" and Sylvester Stallone's ""Lock Up""), the film is deemed exceptional only by your willingness to surrender to Darabont's predictable machinations.  Darabont may be a talented screenwriter, and some of his creations here (such as the character played by William Sadler, who comes across during an inventory inspection a copy of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" by Alexander...Dumbass) are unmistakeably human, his portrayal of the Bible-thumping warden (Bob Gunton) cannot resist but to relegate itself to stereotype. The film's real downfall is in Tim Robbins' performance, who despite his squeaky-clean cherub face cannot project the inspiration needed to give this film its realistic element.  And yet this is not a bad movie, just certainly not the best movie of all time.  Some images of the movie will continue to stay with me: the cold-hearted sexual depravity of ""the Sisters""; and in the infamous shot beautifully and rigidly painted by cinematographer Roger Deakins (""Fargo""), Dufresne basking in a downpour upon entering freedom. Unfortunately, the film isn't cohesive enough to warrant any more of those moments."
tt0108052,"Took me years to finally watch it through. It feels so lazy, cheap and boooringu... That's it."
tt0993846,"It's comforting to imagine that everything Martin Scorsese touches turns to gold, but it's not true. The same rules of thoroughness that apply to every other filmmaker also apply to Scorsese. If he rushes through a compressed editing schedule to meet an Oscar-friendly release date ‚Äì as he did on The Wolf of Wall Street ‚Äì his work suffers. Scorsese's latest clocks in at 180 minutes, not because its characters or narrative demand that kind of exhaustive treatment, but because Scorsese didn't have time to find a more focused, impactful shape for the film. Exploring the personal and professional corruption of notorious stockbroker Jordan Belfort, The Wolf of Wall Street has several memorable sequences, but it plays like a clumsy, repetitive work-in-progress.Praise has already been heaped upon Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill for their charismatic performances, but it's important to note that this is wacky comic acting more concerned with eliciting shock and amusement than any deeper human truth. This miscalculation of emphasis also infects the storytelling in a more general sense. Scorsese and screenwriter Terence Winter focus nearly all of their attention on the excesses ‚Äì sex, drugs, greed ‚Äì that drive these characters, rarely placing them in a context that might reveal complicating texture or shading. It's perfectly logical to portray these characters as one-note imbeciles with an absence of inner life, but this also makes for stifling, unsatisfying drama.The Wolf of Wall Street never finds its bearings, but it becomes more tolerable in its second half when Belfort finally encounters some resistance (in the form of FBI agent Patrick Denham, played by Kyle Chandler) and sees his warped life of excess start to unravel. But even then, the film is dragged down by its reliance on Belfort's moronic perspective ‚Äì the film is derived from his self-mythologizing memoir ‚Äì which gives an Animal House frivolity to his constant misbehaviour, a smokescreen that distracts from the devastation of his professional crimes.Simply recycling sensibilities from Goodfellas and The Departed may seem like a logical strategy, but there's a crucial difference this time around. Whereas gangsters generally do harm to other gangsters, Belfort's victims are relatively innocent, draining this film's lawlessness of charm and fascination. Scorsese's ability to find humanity in reprehensible characters has always been one of his greatest strengths, but he doesn't even attempt to humanize the characters in The Wolf of Wall Street. This wilful oversight results in one of the director's most disposable, nihilistic films, a half-hearted effort that abandons the complexities of his own world view in favour of Belfort's clueless primitivism. This might have made for a uniquely compelling Todd Phillips (The Hangover) movie, but in the hands of Scorsese, this mildly entertaining diversion feels hopelessly erratic and insubstantial."
tt0993846,"SPOILER ALERTBased on the autobiography of convicted fraudster Jordan Belfort, The Wolf of Wall Street is as much a scam as Belfort himself. While the former swindles investors out of their money, the latter cheats the viewers of their time.There are numerous reasons why this film is an utter failure.Firstly, there is no depth to the characters and character development is non-existent. They start of as superficial, one dimensional caricatures and end as such.Secondly, there is no context. We aren't afforded the opportunity to understand where the madness began. We are never shown the victims and the effects of the perpetrators' fraud.Thirdly, there is no plot. This film is simply three hours of persistent, droning debauchery. In fact, it almost appears that Scorsese's aim was just to exhibit endless variation of depravity, with no plot and no context to justify it. And that's my main gripe: the film is just three hours of gratuitous obscenity, with a redundant plot, no sense of direction and absolutely no purpose. We wait for the film to 'take off' but it never really does. It, quite simply becomes a gluttonous and disturbingly self-indulgent seminal celebration of human piggishness, rot and squalor.Which brings me to my final point: the film is an unapologetic celebration of human baseness and predation. We are left to absorb the gamut of tedious depravity and obscenity without any particular meaning or point to it; besides perhaps crass titillation.With its rave reviews, box office success and Oscar nominations, I think it's fitting to refer to The Wolf of Wall Street as the Emperor; with no clothes."
tt0167260,"Ok just to clear something up. Despite the amazing amount of hype and numerous people saying these film were the best ever, I tried when I watched this and 1st film to watch them with an open mind neither being swayed to thinking there great because everyone else said this or the opposite. But come on, people. I have to say they appear just whizzy special effects lead extreme good versus dark (as in surroundings) ugly evil people (basically Star Wars). The storyline is tame and straighforward and the characters uninteresting. Star Wars is better and there massively overrated as well (if they removed those annoying 2 robots all together). Its basically a good film for kids with all this simplicity and straight good v evil, and I fail to see why so many adults like it so much. None of the three films deserve to be in the top100 if your like and competition of thoughtful, intelligent, well acted, important, sharply written films there. Maybe everyone just likes a straight forward situation of immense good vs terrible evil, so they know who there supporting, rather than the immensely complicated debatable thought provoking events of real life.I guess thats why the genre is called fantasy."
tt0068646,"A bad movie, just lots of conversation for 3 hours, and little action."
tt0172495,"So i watched this movie because it was suggested after watching 300 (which i liked better to be honest) and at the beginning i liked it very much, but the end was very predictable. One big disappointment was the language. Before i watched this movie, i watched Narcos with its authentic Spanish, Braveheart with this awesome Scottish Accent and Inglourious Basterds with Brad Pitt and his cool Tennessee Accent. I don't want to say that the whole movie should have been in Latin, but this American English destroyed the whole atmosphere. I would not say it's a shitty movie, but in my opinion it doesn't deserve an eight-point-five score."
tt0120815,"The film may have been more than well-done gore-fest if any of the characters had been remotely interesting, I may have cared whether or not their lives were worth risking.  Their mission didn't seem any riskier than anything else they may have encountered.  There was no dramatic conflict.  The character-developing monologues were nauseating and the stories they told were recycled workshop material.  The true story upon which the film was based was totally undermined, and Spielberg's point of view is uncommitted, self-involved, and pedestrian.  He quotes Abraham Lincoln instead of exploring the issues, and asks for approval at the end. Frankly, the emptiness of the story, characters, and treatment wasn't worth the pain of the opening scene."
tt1345836,"The plot is very good and unpredictable, the story is amazing just like The Dark Knight. Nolan did a great job doing this movie with a very huge expectations from the movie critics following the huge success from the earlier sequel, The Dark Knight in 2008. The Catwoman role was bigger than I thought it would be, she was an enemy but then became Batman's partner Tom Hardy's Bane look terrific and menacing with his control-freak personality and a bit of Joker's agent-of-chaos. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's role is also bigger than it looks like from the trailer, from a young cops to be the new Batman It's very satisfying how Nolan showed us that ""Batman Always Win"" and the fact that Bruce Wayne live made my day Overall a very great movie"
tt1853728,"If anyone else had done this movie, it would be savaged for its low quality. I don't know what this movie was supposed to be. The apparent possibilities are: 1. spaghetti western, 2. black exploitation film, 3. overblown gore fest, 4. knockoff of heaven only knows how many other movies. In the end it was some of all. But the acting, except for the good Dr. Schultz, is miserable. Everyone is a caricature. If I was black, I'd be offended. Fox doesn't act, he glowers. The settings are all wrong....I mean snow-capped peaks in the South? The firearms are not period correct. You can even see the Italian proof marks on them. No effort was made to put together anything other than a 3 hour endurance test for your bladder. It's cheesy. It's lame. It is predictable. Think of this as a pizza from Chuckee Cheeze. It looks like fun. It has lots of colors. I even looks like it is consumable. But in the end it is just another rotten pizza.Yes, I understand, the director or producer of this knows that everything is wrong. I guess that is part of its so-called charm. But don't call this great cinema. Oscars? What, are you on crack? The best way to watch this film is as part of a Mystery Science Theater 3000. In that way you can at least enjoy the humor.Otherwise, wait for Netflix or the $5 bin at Walmart. It isn't worth the price of admission."
tt0114369,I really liked the movie's direction and atmosphere. Acting was great. Characters were real with sufficient motives. Cinematography was perfect. Over all was a good work of art in many aspects of filmmaking. The film's score helped to create the tone of the film. Very good camera work and Art direction was very good. I will give This movie A.
tt0848228,"The only way this film can be enjoyed is to toss away all expectations of what makes up good cinema and instead go in expecting some cool action, hot chicks and a few wisecracks.In this endeavor it succeeds fairly well; it is in fact almost nonstop action, and it flows well for this purpose. There's hardly a moment of relative boredom or dullness, and it keeps your attention throughout. Pacing is something many films have trouble with and this does it well.The special effects and sound editing were very well-done too. Not once did I think they were overdone or cheesy-looking/-sounding, and they packed a punch. The way the aliens looked was neat, and most of the fighting was cool to watch. What sticks out in my memory is Thor hitting his hammer against Captain America's shield, an awesomely done scene for effects.The humorous one-liners, mostly stemming from Tony Stark but also from the camaraderie among the Avengers group, also work well enough and keep you at least smiling throughout.However, I sensed a strong amount of cold, calculated filmmaking here. I felt almost no style in this entire film, and instead I felt as if Joss Whedon had a quota to fill as he was filming it. It's almost as if he was thinking, ""I need to show what happens during the following encounters: Thor vs. Captain America, Thor vs. Iron Man, Iron Man vs. Loki"", etc., and then later on, many combinations of two or three of the Avengers fighting bad guys together, to contrast their earlier conflicts. I appreciate the contrast that went into that aspect, but it just felt plain robotic the way it was executed. The thought pattern I detected was, ""You damn well can't have an Avengers movie without this happening, and this, and..."" The result of this is that this ""quota"" took the focus and actually enticing filmmaking was put on the backburner. He was simply showing things happening with entirely no flair or style of direction whatsoever. Oh look, here's Iron Man coming in to save the day! He's going to say something funny, don't we know it! Nothing stylish, unexpected or cinematic happens in this entire film. It left a dry taste in my mouth, despite all the cool effects and fighting.The story, along with the direction, was very milquetoast and forgettable. To briefly summarize: Loki, an alien, comes down to Earth to wreak havoc; the Avengers team up and stop him and all the aliens he summons through a giant portal as well. You'd think Nick Fury, being the leader of the Avengers, would take on a more interesting storyline role, but he really doesn't. I was maniacally uninterested in every single scene with him talking to the heads of S.H.I.E.L.D., and beyond that his storyline doesn't really go many places in this film. In fact all the other individual character storylines didn't really go anywhere either, which is okay since this film was a group effort, but the overall group storyline was not very interesting either, basically another rendition of saving the planet. Therefore neither the overarching group storyline nor the individual storylines were very fulfilling, leaving the story as a whole lacking.The script was also extremely dry and poorly written. I feel this was another item that went on the backburner to give the aforementioned ""quota"" more focus. Most of the lines were very uninteresting and without character. One example that stuck out in my mind is Nick Fury saying, ""I'll bet you $10 you're wrong"". People may say this phrase in reality; it's not the realism about it I attack but the character and flair of it. This is a movie; when characters speak they should be saying things that are somewhat relevant, interesting, mysterious, gripping, funny, or any combination thereof. Something that delivers, something with edge or character. Most of the lines in the entire film I have completely forgotten already except ones like the above that I remembered just to point out how uninteresting they are. Just like with the direction, I felt as if the script, too, just had people saying things to move the story along. Very sparsely was any extra style or flair or character added in.Last but entirely not least is the acting, and overall I was disappointed. I'll start with the good: Robert Downey Jr. was his usual funny smartass self, and I have no complaints, nor was he exceptional. I also actually quite enjoyed Chris Evans as Captain America; I find him a talented actor who works well in various kinds of films. Also Scarlett Johansson did a great job as usual. I love Stellan Skarsg√•rd; he's a great actor, but I have to admit his placement in the film felt awkward and every time he came on screen I chose to express it through hysterical laughter. Samuel L. Jackson did a decent job as Nick Fury but I wasn't very impressed, but I blame that on the script. Now for the bad: The main villain of the film, Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston, was a terrible choice for the main villain of any film. I mostly laughed at his scenes, because of how bad his acting was, when laughter was unintended. The guy who plays Thor, Chris Hemsworth, was not very good either in this film. Also Mark Ruffalo was a disappointment to see. I don't mind his acting normally but it was just so noticeably inferior to Edward Norton's Hulk that it has to count as a negative.To sum up, good pacing, special effects and some interesting encounters between certain characters do not save a film when it has weak direction, a weak script, a weak storyline, mostly weak acting, and most glaring of all it seemed very cold, calculated, and without style. However, I was at least mildly entertained."
tt0172495,"Everybody said this movie was worth seeing, so I went and saw it. The beginning was promising; mighty battle scene. After that, I just kept wondering if I'm missing the greatness, because I couldn't see any.Action scenes were very nice, otherwise very big disappointment."
tt0515674,"This episode, The Mini-Series, reminded me of the famous two-parter episode of Seinfeld that debuted in 1992, being The Trip: Part 1 and The Trip: Part 2, where Jerry and George go to Los Angeles and do the night show rounds, and also look for Kramer. So here there's major interest in adapting Lionel's story into a mini-series, and I like the meta aspects of this and the fact that Lionel considers the mini-series the epitome of approval of his life's work and all. Anyway, Fiona Mollison guest stars as Sally Curtis, and Freddie Stuart guest stars as the Porter. Anyway, I'm enjoying reflecting on As Time Goes By."
tt0114369,"From David Fincher, Se7en is a compelling and brilliant postmodern film noir. It is grim and disturbing but it is also very intelligent and daring. What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill's uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much. Overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0167261,"The plot of this movie is about Barlago from Garganda who needs to get to Margalala before the Embligs reach it and try to destroy the Ziglwigs... or something like that.  Maybe if I had immersed myself in the trilogy and attended sci-fi conventions beforehand, I could've actually understood the story.  Instead, it plays like a big, spectacular video game.  Admittedly, I kind of enjoyed it because it is visually the most amazing thing we've seen on the screen yet, especially the computer generated character with the big ears (Grogglegorf, I think).  All the names sound alike, most of the characters look alike, and there are too many of them to care about any of them.  The scene with the H.R. Puffenstuff trees was mildly humorous, although I don't think that was intentional. So the plot is probably even less penetrable to non-geeks than the first one, but it is oh so fun to watch.  If you are not a sci-fi geek, go for the visuals.  Computer graphics have reached the promised land -- it is a landmark movie in that regard. Just don't expect to be included in this little Star Trek Convention of a movie unless you've read the books."
tt0108052,"Revisiting Schindler's List in the context of the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict offers a different insight. All literary and artistic works with a historical narrative have a distinct cultural standpoint and perspective. Schindler's List is a historical narrative from the standpoint and perspective of the Jewish people. We were shocked and moved at the beginning because even with a distinct cultural standpoint and perspective, the film has a respect for life and a call for peace beyond the standpoint. Now, in the context of the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict, that call for love and peace is ironic. What about saving one life, saving the whole world? I began to gradually understand that narrative is a kind of power, who controls the narrative, who controls the power. History goes undiscovered at the time of its occurrence and has been reorganized at the time of its discovery. The chroniclers of history, no matter how objective they claim to be, describe history with their own cultural standpoint, and history is reconstructed in the description and interpretation time and time again. Even if the historical truth is narrated, through cutting, the reorganization of successive events, it can make history very different, not to mention, there are spring and autumn writing methods, small words. Like the Jewish construction of their own history and experience, it is a powerful power. Although limited by various factors, the rise of we-media is to some extent a snatch and reconstruction of the right of discourse of traditional media, at least it enables us to view the Palestinian-Israeli conflict from a different perspective. If we do not occupy the position of culture and public opinion, the enemy will occupy it. Make a good master of the two powerful historical narrative tools of film and short video. Support Palestine."
tt0120737,"Real-life link: Surprisingly, I can't think of anything that during the movie made me think 'Hmm would be good to remember this if I get into similar situations'. So no real life links from this one that I can take away.Plausibility: a bit low on this category as well. I find it a bit implausible that a young and inexperienced hobbit would volunteer to go to one of the most frightening places when even the most braves leaders of all middle earth refuse to go. I also find it a bit implausible Froddos friends would volunteer to go with him to these dangerous places given that the movie does not provide any reason for us to believe that their friendship is that strong.Storytelling: this is the strength of the movie. You won't get bored watching this. The story moves fast and progresses so gratefully. One event leads to the other in a great manner.Character development: Characters are also another strength of the movie. They all embark a development joinery. We are given enough background of the main ones so that it makes us curious to see how they will develop and act when they are confronted with difficult decisions and events.Overall, great development of story and an interesting movie."
tt0109830,"To tell the truth,I don't agree with certain views expressed in this movie and I thought the characters were stereotypical.I have to admit Tom Hanks is a great actor but this is not his best movie.That honour goes to The Green Mile.But Forrest Gump was an overrated movie because it won the best picture oscar among excellent and intelligent movies like The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction.I thought the movie dragged on and the only high point of the movie was Tom Hanks' excellent portrayal of Forrest Gump.You can watch this movie once,not more than that."
tt0342804,"Anthony lost his battle to cancer. He died last week. The family is very sad, but Anthony was so very, very sick. He is in a better place now and not in so much pain.The film really does show Anthony's true self. He was a sweet, loving kid who never complained. He had a wicked sense of humor and was stoic about his disease.There will be a memorial service in Fairfield sometime in January. Susan and the rest of the kids are doing as well as can be expected. Everyone is just so very sad.As far as the film, I would recommend it to almost anyone, though I think it would be too upsetting for some children. And Susan has lost so much weight since the film was made. Too bad people can't see how great she looks now, and how much more energy she has."
tt0114369,"Good Movie and entertaining plot twist.
But nothing special."
tt7286456,"Phoenix convinces me that he has always meant to be the joker. The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down."
tt1345836,"You just don't watch a Nolan movie. You experience it. Something happens inside you after you're done watching any of his movies.The Dark Knight Rises is not just a movie, its a baggage of expectations, its a sequel to The Dark Knight, it has been directed by Chris Nolan, it has the Batman and people have already started with their assumptions and speculations.Does the movie survive all this?Yes. Definitely yes.Batman Begins dealt with fear. The Dark Knight dealt with chaos. The Dark Knight Rises deals with pain.Eight years have been passed since the demise of Harvey Dent. Batman had hung up the boots and started blaming himself for Harvey's Death and everything. With all the injuries he had sustained while fighting under that bat suit and the depression, he is no longer the Bruce Wayne Gotham knows. People have been questioning his sanity. Wayne empire is declining.In comes Bane. The dark, brutal, masked and monolithic beast who almost destroys Wayne enterprises to seek Batman.Selina Kyle, a female burglar who teases Bruce Wayne with her attitude and activities.As a result, Batman is forced to come back. What follows is the series of events that not only blow your mind away but cast a magical spell to last the full life time.There are a several new players that have been introduced in the film, such as Wayne's love interest and the new age cop John Blake who does the job of being the good side kick of Gordon and plays in an important role in convincing Bruce Wayne to be back as the caped crusader to protect Gotham one last time from the terror of Bane and army.So is The Dark Knight Rises better than The Dark Knight? If you were one of those fans who prefer Batman Begins to TDK then you'll find much to love about TDKR. And if you weren't then no Batman film will ever match TDK for you.As both Batman and Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale's work here is master- class, and he gives the character such an inescapable melancholy ‚Äì a certain perseverance in the face of absolute resignation to his fate ‚Äì that he becomes a more tragic figure than ever. That said, he's aided enormously by a never-better Michael Caine, who turns with hope and palpable love what might otherwise be expository dialogue into searing, supportive criticisms of Wayne's self-destruction.On the other hand, after being marketed as heir to the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" Tom Hardy's Bane is a different sort of villain ‚Äì a focused and more ideologically-developed version of Heath Ledger's Joker ‚Äì but one with equally ruthless charm.While she doesn't quite steal the show as Heath Ledger's Joker did, Hathaway's Catwoman is a magnetic presence whenever she's on screen and she has great chemistry with Bale. Selina may be the proverbial good bad girl, the thief with a heart of gold, but Hathaway imbues her with a wounded spirit and a survivor's edge that makes her feel genuine and sympathetic even when she's being naughty.That being said, the acts of good old Gary Oldman and the power house Joseph Gordon Levitt cannot be ignored.Christopher Nolan is in peak time of his life. Whatever he is touching is turning into gold. He has taken The Batman series to a level which no one in thousand years can reach. The action scenes, the rise and the fall of all the characters along with the climax are just the pieces of the puzzle, which in the end you feel was taking shape since the day Batman Begins released. The first hour ties all the loose ends the first two movies left behind and the climax is so apt that you leave the theater feeling contended and satisfied.We may never see superhero films quite like these again, and that's fine. Nolan had something special to say with his time in the trenches, and he's ended on his own terms.I wonder which series Nolan decides to reboot next!"
tt7286456,"This is probably one of the most successful examples of a gorgeous solo film about some popular character.The Joker was played by the inimitable Joaquin Phoenix (known for his role in Gladiator), and people comparing him to Ledger are very narrow-minded, because Phoenix showed us a completely new Joker, who is gorgeous in his own way.The plot tells about a sick man Arthur, who suffers eternal ridicule over himself, lives and cares for his mother, and also dreams of being accepted by people, thanks to his performance on Murray's favorite humor show (De Niro)
As a result, we will see a man becoming a monster because of our society, of course not without his mental illness, but the nature of people clearly pushed the main character to become a Joker.This is a gorgeous dramatic thriller, with some cool reference for the future (little Bruce, Thomas Wayne, etc.), which is a must-watch! (And not only for DS fans)"
tt0120815,"A very cool movie that contains the best movie editorial, a shocking ending, characters that the viewer has to watch, and a great acting representation"
tt0114369,"It was good, surprising end, but in fact it might be much surprising if I watched this movie in 1995. I understood the reason why the criminal tried to make the main character kill him, but he could not enjoy the completion of his perfect plan. Even if he would be fine for that, it seems too unrealistic."
tt0108052,"No doubt a powerful and disturbing film about THE MOST tragic time in humanity, and it broke my heart to see all the mistreatment and the carelessness/complete disregard for human life. I can't help wonder, though, if the story is really credible. Why would a German businessman risk his life and undergo bankruptcy to save people that his very people were against? If this story really is true, I doubt he did so out of the kindness of his heart, but more for reputation-boosting. I expected a lot from this film, after all, it outlines something horrifying and truly a tragedy, but I couldn't help thinking that this film undermined the sensitivity of this subject by including a greedy, selfish, profiteering, womanizing German businessman in the story. I think that if you really want to learn more about the Holocaust, it should not be through films such as this, but through actual real-life documentaries that include no ""other"" unnecessary characters/stories, but truly tell the real pain, the real hurt and loss of the Jewish people who were treated so badly just because they believed differently from others. Regardless, there were some truly powerful moments in the film: The pictures of the starving prisoners who were forced to strip and be inspected by Nazi doctors, who would determine whether they could work or whether they should be killed. The little girl in the bright red dress, the only color, the only sunshine, in an otherwise gray, dark period of time, the very essence of innocence, and her symbolism later in the film when her lifeless body is wheelbarrowed over to the ever-growing pile of dead bodies that were to be incinerated. When Amon Goeth's young Jewish maid asks Oskar Schindler why he shot an elderly woman who was just passing by, bothering no one, looking at no one; his reply: because she meant nothing to him, she was just one of those people who neither bothered nor pleased him, just that she was just a random person with no meaning to him, was the reason why he so cruelly took a life so easily.I do think this film is worth watching, no doubt, but please don't automatically assume you know everything about the Holocaust because you watched this film; this film portrayed life less harshly than life for the imprisoned actually was. Please watch documentaries on the Holocaust, research more through books and legitimate media, if you want the true facts."
tt0139414,"An idiotic film if ever there were. Crocodiles come to a lake in Maine and wreak death upon the citizenry and in many cases, the film becomes a comedy. It's a comedy in the sense that it's so bad that it's almost laughable.The Oliver Platt part as Hector is questionable. He is a college professor? The guy is a real nut in every sense. We know that Betty White is an animal lover in real life, but this is ridiculous. She plays Mrs. Bickerman, the latter could have been a golden girl. She feeds animals including the crocodiles and then admits that her husband was killed by one.A senseless production, inane and beyond the realm of human comprehension."
tt0120815,"Smug liberal Spielberg toggles back and forth between documentary style violence and sentimental reflections between soldiers: the Captain is revealed to be an English Lit teacher in civilian life who can instruct the novice writer character and others with idealised rhetoric about both the unique contribution each can make to the mission as well as their ability to choose at will a vision/memory of ""the good life"" back home worth fighting for: this emphasis upon individual freedom detracts from shared debate among the men about both the worthiness of the mission to save one guy, and the larger reasons for American involvement in the war. This deflates any anti- war sentiment in the film. Significantly, Ryan is the sole survivor who must, alone in the cemetery (predictably, his accompanying family are as silent as his fallen comrades), decide/hope he was ""a good man"" worthy of their sacrifice. In this emotional lynchpin of the movie, Spielberg suggestively cuts to Old Glory flapping in the wind: the link drawn between liberal pluralism/individual choice and the symbol of America remains an insidious and powerful ideological moment, equalled only by the title character in ""Schindler's List"" who had the power to choose who would live or die. Consistently in his historical revisionist pieces, Spielberg suggests this is the only kind of freedom worth fighting for, with no awareness of how it merely compounds the tragedy."
tt0167260,"Well, the trilogy has ended, and it's time for some conclusions. First of all, Return of the King is, IMO, not as good as Fellowship of the Ring. On the other hand, it's definitely better than The Two Towers, which I think is by far the weakest of the three films.All in all Return of the King is certainly a good film, but it's too long, the battle scenes somewhat lack intensity and when it's all over you're left with this lingering ""was that it?"". Don't get me wrong, I like the film, but it does feel as something of an anti-climax. Perhaps it's simply not possible to transfer the enormity and intensity of what's meant to take place to film. The battle scenes are a bit dull, they lack intensity and realism, which is too bad because the battle scenes are in many ways the most important part of the film. To make it all worse (at least as I see it), they try to make up for it with slapstick, kill count and silly comments from Gimli, who is again reduced to comic relief, as well as a tendency to focus on the ""really big stuff"" (TM); oliphants, various trolls and the big siege weapons, instead of really following the battle. Also, I find the constant switching between Frodo and Sam and the battles annoying because it breaks up the battle scenes, jerking you out of the action just as it's starting to pull you in. RotK simply doesn't do a good enough job of making you ""feel"" the intensity of battle. Some movies can almost make you smell the blood, RotK doesn't achieve that, in fact there's hardly any blood at all and often just a lot of CGI (I guess the PG13 rating didn't help in that department). CGI has come far, but battle scenes are still vastly better with real people.Anyway, most of the movie is pretty good, but it never quite achieves ""lift off"" before it touches down on the ground again. As with the Matrix trilogy, the sequels just don't quite live up to the first, although I will say again that I think RotK is a good, although not brilliant, movie, and definitely better than Two Towers. There's no reason not to watch this film and I'm almost certain it won't be as good on DVD as it is on the big screen (mostly because the CGI and FX are so important), so go see it in a cinema while you have the chance. If you say this is the best movie you've ever seen, however (and it's almost a law of nature that some people will whenever a new LotR flick is out), I suggest you see some more movies. (Yes, I find all the LotR fanboys, and -girls, who uncritically love the movies with a zeal unmatched even by the most die-hard religious fundamentalists, extremely annoying)"
tt0110912,"This was one of the films that consolidated Tarantino's career and made him one of the ""superstar"" directors who, whenever he releases a film, whether good or bad, attracts a legion to the cinema. I was never a fan of his, and I don't think I will be. He made some films that I liked and others that I hated. I wouldn't call it regular, a ""safe bet"", but we can't deny it, it's original, true to his style and doesn't seem concerned about pleasing anyone.The film follows more than one plot: we have a couple of violent bandits who try to rob a cafeteria, we have a boxer at the end of his career who has to flee after winning a fight he had agreed he would lose, we have a couple of murderers in the pay of a mobster who are tasked with recovering a stolen suitcase, and we also have the capricious girlfriend of that same mobster, whose boredom forces her darling to assign one of his assassins to babysit for her. What unites them all? In addition to the fact that they naturally intersect, they are all part of the same violent, brutal and marginal universe.For many, this film is one of the best of the 90's. I would never consider it as such, that is, for me, an exaggeration. It's reasonably good, it's gained cult status, it has fans, but it's not a masterpiece, not for me. It's not a boring film, it doesn't tire us out and the various sub-plots are intertwined very well, with skill and elegance. There's a lot of violence, heavy slang and drugs, and that can be really hard at times, I felt that too. However, this heavier language, drugs and violence end up being a natural part of the underworld of crime and marginality where the characters move, so it's something we can count on right from the start. And there are no sympathetic characters who can arouse some empathy, so it doesn't matter to us whether they live or die in the most unpleasant ways (and some of them suffer a lot).These are all qualities, and will be even more valued by those who are more familiar with the ""pulp"" literary subgenre. I'm not, it's not part of my culture, and I even had to go look it up on the Internet to understand what it was, and what its characteristics were. Despite that, there are a few things about this film that I really didn't like or felt over the top. One of them is the dialogues. There are scenes with a lot of dialogues, dialogues without any interest, which can dwell on boring topics, just because. One of them, right at the beginning of the film, is about foot massages, just to give a small example. There are many scenes that seem overly drawn out due to these endless dialogues. I also think the film has too many images of bare feet. Tarantino gained fame as a fetishist, but he always said he wasn't... watching this film makes it hard to believe him. And one of the characters, who is a murderer, makes a very long quote from the Bible... it's the kind of ""literature"" that I think an underworld murderer probably wouldn't know by heart.The actors are very good, we have several notable names: John Travolta is excellent in the role he was given, with that black suit and his hair soaked in oil. Samuel L. Jackson is not far behind, and Uma Thurman is fantastic. I would say that, at least, Thurman and Travolta achieve performances at the best level of their respective careers in this film. Bruce Willis isn't bad, but he's just not that interesting. I enjoyed seeing my countrywoman Maria de Medeiros in her only major international role, I'm sorry she couldn't go further, but that's life. Tarantino also appears in the film, and it would have been much better if he hadn't. He's a ham as an actor.Technically, the film has many qualities, starting with the excellent cinematography, with vivid colors and good lighting. There are excellent action scenes, for all tastes, and the soundtrack makes good use of several musical themes that we know very well."
tt0111161,"Oh come on 2nd best movie ever, I don't think so.  It's unrealistic and overly sentimental, the people who voted so high can't have seen many films. By all means watch it, but Papillion for example, is far superior, who can forget Steve McQueen's red rimmed eyes and pasty face as he catches bugs, and crushes centipedes into his watery broth to get nourishment in that incredible portrayal of hardship and determination.  I wouldn't put Papillion as the 2nd best film of all time, but it has to be the best Prison drama.  Watch Shawshank and you'll enjoy it as a lightweight entertaining feel good movie, but there are so many classic films better than this."
tt0816692,"Special effects are the real winner in this movie, not the plot, not the acting. Most of the story makes little sense and the characters are annoying, except for the ever charming Michael Caine. The plausibility factor was as poor as some 1950's sci-fi and less fun. Back to the Future was and is more interesting. I would have to say it was not a boring movie, but too much talking and teen angst out of adult scientists. Ann Hathaway has no place playing anyone with a PhD. The ""Dust Bowl"" effect was not terribly convincing, they could have made it seem a lot grimmer. There were too many ""that wouldn't happen"" moments for me, I couldn't suspend reality because they would keep mixing facts in and then do stuff that was pointless and unrealistic. The noise of the background was so loud often I couldn't understand the dialog, low bass organ music and rocket engine noise so loud my chair vibrated. The characters were doing things that didn't add to the story and just seemed immature, you almost couldn't root for the human race to survive."
tt0120815,"This movie starts and ends with shots of the American flag which points to one of its biggest problems. It purports to be an anti war film but this rubbish. While it may show the horrors of war in graphic detail, it ultimately is a celebration of militarism and heroism. Sure, heroism doesn't mean it's a pro-war movie but this movie goes beyond that. It's little surprise that the military are among the biggest fans of this movie. It may not celebrate war as a something good, but then, I can't think of any film that does outside of propaganda movies. If you want an anti war movie that shows heroism and mateship without celebrating the military, watch ""All Quiet on the Western Front"".It does follow the standard American war movie characterisation rather faithfully. The Germans are universally evil, other nations are either non-existent, villains or locals who get saved by the Americans. Well in this case it is not that far from the truth, without the Americans the war would have gone on much longer than it did and the Germans were villains. But all these facts are distorted and stereotyped in a bad way here. For example, the only German with a sizeable speaking role turns out to be a total coward and backstabber who repays the Americans who saved his life by shooting them.There are a couple of good points to the movie though. It does deviate somewhat from the standard US heroic movies in that it shows that Americans committed war crimes too, like shooting soldiers who had already surrendered. There are also some quite powerful scenes that are as good as any Spielberg has done. Best among them is the scene where a father in a French village tries to pass his daughter to one of the soldiers to save her. This single scene can probably verify this movie's claim to show the horrors of war somewhat. The landing in the Normandy is good, although somewhat overrated. I wasn't there so I can't comment on the realism but it felt like this was close to what it was really like.Many people were upset that the movie only shows Americans fighting the Germans, but for once, this is not really a valid argument since the various armies fought in different areas and would have had very little contact amongst each other.The movie really goes downhill towards the end though when the troop actually find Ryan. Instead of being glad to be out of this hell, he wants to stay there to help out his comrades. Very anti war indeed. This is where the movie turns totally Hollywood and looses all claim it may have had to a somewhat realistic portrayal. A number of people had died already in trying to find Ryan and his decision to stay there costs another couple of people their lifes yet the movie makes him a total hero for it. Steven Spielberg is capable of making great movies, this isn't one of them.The acting is not particularly good and leaves out no cliches. Tom Hanks was actually nominated for an Academy Award for a role that Pee Wee Herman could have played better.Finally, the salutation scene in the end is totally stomach churning."
tt0381429,"As another mentioned, this also reminded me some of ""Morvern Callar"" ( a great book and movie). However ""Morvern"" seemed more a paean to existentialism. In that book/movie, sure there is a death early on that sort of launches the great Samantha Morton on her way, but her adventures felt like a natural extension of her identity.Here Abbie Cornish's character recoils from an incident that opens the film, and her ""Heidi"" feels a lot more like a girl than ""Morvern's"" woman. She too has an adventure, and her naivete somehow portrays her vulnerability and strength.I'd also add that this film is a quest for empathy, while ""Morvern"" as I recall has as much interest in empathy as an ant.The teenager at risk may be a sadly recurring theme (in film and life) but director Cate Shortland finds little touches here and there, red mittens, a doughnut, the toy piano on the Decoder Ring soundtrack, breath flashing in frozen air. The movie captures a coldness in its Australian Alps (never heard that phrase till this) to reflect the callousness that Heidi navigates.The inn-keeper was pivotal and offered more than temporary shelter to Heidi, but also offered an emotional center for us the audience. The men without fail here are either faux tough or righteous, but authentically weak. Their weakness amplified by efforts to exploit.At one point, Heidi and one of the weak men stop in front of a lake, that was a man-made, flooded zone where beneath it houses, and streets lie submerged. Perhaps a bit heavy handed, but that notion of what lies ""under the surface"" is how the characters are strung together in this.Heidi seems destined to sink and drown, but has a strange buoyancy that keeps you watching. Keeps you hoping.I'm curious to see more of Shortland's work after *finally* having this bubble up in my queue. Preferably ""Flowergirl"" before ""Black Widow"" though. The DVD extras here were a nice study in why leaving details out (a homework scene and a back-story for Heidi's collage work) can end up adding more to a movie.The movie is a bit of a heart-twisting watch, but well worth it.A stick-with-it film imho.Shortland also mentioned bleaching Cornish's eyebrows, which gave her an almost alien look at times...which fits with the sort of strange way she floats through the film. It also made her look very young, I believe the character was supposed to be 16. Granted the actress was I think in her early 20's, still that might speak to something unpleasant and beneath the surface in our western cinema gaze?For a less cynical take, Heidi's just wanting to be loved and specifically to hold hands. That broke through the jaded surface to me, of course it has a childlike affect, but reminds me of a authentic kind of love that too often gets dismissed. This was one of those films that had me wondering how to be more tender to those I love. If not to be a better and kinder innkeeper no matter what may happen."
tt0109830,"To kill the only enlightened and liberated character (Robin Wright) with an 'un-named disease' in the early 1980s when both Reagan and Thatcher refused to acknowledge the aids epidemic is unforgivable. As is the idiotic notion that 'in America anyone can be anything they want' - try telling that to the under-privileged, mentally ill, destitute and homeless. The American hegemony continues to bury it's head in the sand and disseminate doctrine like this. Don't get me wrong, I love a great deal about the U.S. (including its people and the culture that so many Europeans mistakenly laugh about) but their ruling classes (Government, heads of industry, religious leaders, Hollywood producers etc) need to look further than their own guarded picket fences. The power of movies to persuade should not be underestimated. I don't mean that old chestnut 'sex and violence', I mean hidden political ideology - The Terminator is running California frrcrissakes!! Not healthy! Rant over! Thank you for reading this far...."

tt0480025,"I'm not sure if this is blatant BNF propaganda or just an honest look at the filmmaker's upbringing, but as an American it plays out sort-of like a UK version of SUBURBIA. Was interesting to see a film about skinheads that kept the music scene so closely associated with the culture nearly nowhere in sight.I'm wondering how audiences upon the film's release handled the scenes of our 11 year old protagonist kissing and talking about sex with a much older girl.An entertaining film that's grim and emotional at times."
tt0110912,Pulp Fiction is a movie all credited to its director....Mr. Q. T. This movie is such an amazing and fast track of events all tied up nicely and cohesively that one can't deny its grandeur.But here comes the boom. It is a highly un-required movie that is overrated just due to its above mentioned qualities. But when something is made there must be a purpose behind its existence but the film is so useless and itchy that in my opinion this film is not the best film in history of cinema. Yes the film has a huge potential to influence movie making and direction but it itself is nothing but a crap of laughable and senseless events.So to mention Sir i am not buying any of this movie but lets just consider the direction and cohesion of events.
tt0139414,"If you're anything like me, you saw the previews to this movie and thought ""oh yeah, sure. I'll be seeing that one."" The PR person for this movie should have been shot in the face. Repeatedly. This movie is a gem. The witty one liners by the cast make it golden. Sure, it's about a giant reptile that's killing people in a lake that isn't even Lake Placid (I'm serious -it's not even set there). It's freaking hilarious, and if my word isn't enough, you simply can't turn down a film in which Betty White tells people to suck her d**k."
tt0068646,"In a word, underwhelming. The Godfather is a decent film with some strong acting, but I did not find any exceptional or unique quality in the film that would render it a masterpiece. It's a simple a mob story in which everybody is an antagonist; the story is not gripping, the characters are hard to care about, the camera work is adequate but not in any way remarkable, the list goes on. I don't think The Godfather is a bad movie, but in no way is it the best I've ever seen, or anywhere close.The movie has been so hyped that I really was expecting to see the best movie all time when I watched it. What I saw was a decent flick with some very quotable moments, but in my mind the film has no singular or superior quality when compared to other great films. Monstrously overrated, but still a respectable movie."
tt0068646,"This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability."
tt0993846,"To say I hated this film would be an understatement. I knew little about it, other than reading a review in Empire magazine a couple of days before. Approximately one hour in, I went and retrieved the magazine to read the review again because I could see no resemblance on screen to the reviewer's glowing praise on the page.Here I must admit to being female, and also totally appalled at the misogynistic, vile portrayal of just about every woman in this film. The only one that isn't pawed over, stripped and slapped about like a piece of meat is Jordan's first wife, but she is lied to, sidelined, betrayed and dropped as though she never meant a thing. The new wife that replaces her gets a 5 minute courtship, a honeymoon period of approximately the same duration, and is then firmly placed on the humiliation conveyor belt.As for the legions of whores and other apparently inconsequential women, just about every scene is filled with their degradation. Not even key colleagues get any respect, as one scene determinedly shows the only woman at work to be named down on her knees in a glass lift with her face firmly stuck to the front of some moron's flies.Yes, I am sure that being a woman has coloured my view of how women are portrayed in this film (and yes, the Empire reviewer was a man) but I notice I am not alone in being disgusted by the over-the-top porn and sheer vileness of behaviour that is revelled in and served up for what I am assured in other reviews is 2.1/2 hours. I probably lasted just over an hour before I gave up. Gave up hoping for any kind of story, gave up hoping for different characters instead of the same character assigned to just about every actor on screen. Gave up hoping that somebody, ANYBODY of the opposite sex might actually be treated fairly, even for half a minute.Where was the story? What was this about? What was the effect on the victims that were sold useless penny stocks? No, they don't feature either as the film relentlessly focuses on the bullies and morons that relieve them of their hard-earned cash with no glimpse of the consequences. When these heroes stop their carousing it is only to have pointless gibbering conversations about nothing which just serve to delay the orgies momentarily. Nothing is said that advances the story as the only story here is sex, drugs and exploitation. It is the pornographic equivalent of an evening looking at someone's boring holiday photos.There is zero progression, zero development, and - as far as I am concerned - zero interest in actually telling a story and entertaining the audience, just a determination to portray every excess known to man for no reason or purpose. Who cares if the real Jordan did any of this? I kept waiting for Vince Vaughn to show up as it was more like one of his puerile comedies than an Oscar-nominated film.I am old enough to have worked in a corporate environment in the City of London during the 80s. Yes the place was awash with money, but every woman was not treated like an expendable whore. Shame on Scorsese and all involved. I am no shrinking violet but so much emphasis on misogynistic, negative behaviour means little or no emphasis on anything else that could have made this a worthwhile film to watch. Ultimately it has nothing to say except F U, and does nothing but relieve the public of its entrance money with little return (true to its subject matter in that respect).This morning I watched District 9 which I had recorded on a whim and also knew nothing about. A film with plenty of heart, made on a tiny fraction of the budget blown on The Wolf of Wall Street, and to much greater effect. No prizes for guessing which of these films I would recommend."
tt0110912,"Well, I finally saw 'Pulp Fiction'. Hadn't after all this time, but I've heard *so* much ta-doo over it, so I rented it.UGH.I guess I must not be film critic material, because I didn't appreciate the 'art' of this film, or its 'brilliance', or any 'statement' it might have made. It was unpleasant, filled with scumbag people I cared nothing about, doing godawful things to each other with horrendously graphic visuals and appalling dialogue. It jumped around in time, circling back to where it opened, but from another viewpoint, and while that may be some sort of artsy crafting in editing or storytelling, it doesn't save it from the fact that it was just plain revolting.When the characters could get away for a second from m-f-ing all over the place, there *was* some interesting verbal exchange... bright and witty and even vaguely profound, but Kafka it ain't. I have to say, I thought all the performances were incredible, esp Samuel Jackson, but can't Quentin Tarantino stay OUT of any of his own films?! Even playing a 'nicer' guy, he comes off as a borderline psycho. I thought it was *very* interesting, tho, to see Chicago Hope's Eric Stoltz in there as a drug dealer.I worry about people's minds, if this is what they think of as a great movie. EEK! A movie about redemption? Gee... I didn't see any of that. If perhaps a character got out of the violent melee alive, I'd hardly call that 'redemption', if they are hardly anyone worth caring about being redeemed in the first place. An earthquake fault could have opened up and swallowed the lot of 'em, and I would have applauded. People think it's really cool or trendy to give accolades to trash nowadays.Time to get some mouthwash for my eyes, and get the stench out of 'em."
tt0068646,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing.  It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well.  Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.  Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life.  This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
tt1345836,"I went to see the Dark Knight Rises last week and I have to say I was impressed. Story-wise it's a lot better than it's predecessors. The plot is coherent and has several interesting twists along the way that I won't spoil for you here. My only complaint is that it is a bit heavy going at some points. 3 hours is a long time, and I wouldn't go so far as to say boring, but it definitely takes a while to pick up the pace. However once it does you are in for a thrill ride.Nolan did a fantastic job with the Characters, from the troubled Bruce Wayne/Batman to Catwoman to the antagonist Bane, as well as secondary characters such as Alfred and Gordon, they are all fleshed out beautifully and are very believable in respect to the source material. Supplemented by superb acting by the all star cast, I have no complaints here.The direction is fantastic. As I said above, it takes a while to pick up, but it never ever get's boring. As soon as you start to think that, something happens that pulls you right back in. Nolan deserves to be commended for this. The action scenes are brilliantly done, the special effects are great, Hans Zimmer's score is, as always, superb, the editing and cinematography are crisp. There really is not much to complain about here.In my personal opinion it is the best installment in the Nolan trilogy, and if you haven't seen it yet I can only recommend you do so as soon as possible."
tt0111161,"The Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you can watch over and over, catching different nuances each time and bringing your own life experiences each time you watch it. Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman should have won an Oscar (a shame he had to wait for Million Dollar Baby.) There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is any drawback to this movie, it is that it is a shade too long, meaning it's often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV. Rent this, or better yet, buy it to get the full thrust of it. Definitely on my personal top 10."
tt0172495,"I thought this film shows all that is wrong with film making at the moment, the story was really terrible, poor guy, doesn't want to fight anymore, oops, they kill his family, now I don't care about anything and I'm going to kill lots of people.This film would have been great if it was released as a comedy, as I laughed quite a lot at the predictable, boring story. The relationship between the Caesar and his sister was just ludicrous, and the effects, although no doubt very expansive, were not really very good.When I came out I didn't know whether to laugh or cry!"
tt1130884,"I went to this movie expecting something intelligent and stylishly executed. I left feeling underwhelmed and disappointed. The story has been done before, so its not clever anymore and i'm not being arrogant when i say it was obvious from the start. Its edited very amateurishly (I don't agree with those saying it was representative of the main characters frame of mind) and there is far too much use of CGI on outside scenes in cars and both. It seemed to me as well that there were some scenes just thrown into the movie that had no actual purpose. e.g the scene in the car with the warden talking about violent. maybe it was too intelligent for me..."
tt0109830,"Absolutely awful concatenation of lachrymose sentimentality and right-wing politics.  I hated this movie with an intensity that cannot be measured. This was one of the most inward looking American movies to be seen in a long time.  Americans seem to believe that there is no other country outside ""Godzone"""
tt0533520,"Buffy summers is an average teenage girl that had just been kicked out from her old school. Wrong! Buffy has very big responsibilities, she has to fight vampires, demons and has to save the world. This may sound like a very stupid and dumb series but you will be amazed.It is a great start to an awesome series. Buffy was kicked out from her old school after burning down the Gym. She moves to Sunnydale where she has thought that she had escaped from her responsibilities but the demons have followed her.She is helped with 2 new close friends that she meets.Very Good start, Joss."
tt0468569,"THIS MOVIE IS WEAK! Unfortunately, this film fails to deliver the same way Batman Begins did. The characters were mishandled (Nolan should do MORE research) and the acting was unsatisfying. Ledger did great, only he was NOT the Joker. The man hardly giggled. I'm sorry, but if you're going to play someone like the Joker, DO NOT go off on a tangent and try your own thing. In a medium like comic books, they're different from books in terms of we get visuals. We know EXACTLY what the Joker is supposed to be like. Ledger dropped the ball big time and Nolan should have done something about it. CELL PHONE SONAR?????????? That was awful. Two-Face looked good and Eckhart was an awesome choice but he had very little to work with. They should have given his character the attention he deserves, meaning his descent stemmed from his childhood, not his damn relationship with his co-worker. Gordon could have been good but he wasn't. Apparently he had to die to catch the Joker. WHAT? The ruse was mishandled. Let your audience know what's happening. Batpod? Whatever. NO BATCAVE???????????? Michael Caine plays an excellent Alfred only he had nothing to do. Does anyone recall the whole thing from Begins about Why do we fall? Apparently EVERYONE forgot it in this one. Everyone had a moral dilemma in this and that's fine, but WE DEALT WITH THIS IN THE FIRST ONE!!!! This is a damn superhero movie and why do people like superheroes? Because they beat up the bad guys. The fight scenes are poor at best because the camera is too close and YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS HAPPENING. I want to watch Batman kick the hell out of an army of jerks, not have it implied. These scenes were the weakest part of the film. Batman films, whether you agree or not, should have scraps like the ones in City of Violence or the hallway scene in Old Boy. THOSE ARE FIGHT SCENES! Does anyone know the plot of this film? Look, I know the Joker was supposed to be insane and never plan a damn thing BUT THERE WAS NO CLIMAX! Every scheme amounts to nothing and in the end of the film, THERE IS NO MOMENT OF TRIUMPH FOR THE BAT! Especially since they locked him up once and THE JOKER GOT OUT! WHY IN SWEET HELL WOULD THE JOKER BE AFRAID OF INCARCERATION?????? Plus, the scene at the end with the boats was a little too far-fetched (I know that's a risky thing to say since this is a film about a man who dressed in a rubber suit to fight crime). I mean, I just don't see people blowing each other up, especially when the National Guard is involved. WEAK! And back to that cell phone sonar thing: CHRISTOPHER NOLAN!!! BATMAN IS SUPPOSED TO BE A DAMN DETECTIVE!!!! WHY HAVEN'T YOU DEALT WITH THAT???? HE DOESN'T NEED THE DAMN SONAR TO FIND JOKER!!!!!! Ultimately, what kills this movie is the writing. Awful!!! David S. GOYER!!! STOP BUTCHERING SUPERHERO MOVIES!!! FIRST THE DAMN CROW (did you think I'd forget, dumb-ass?) THEN NICK FURY FOR TV WITH HASSELHOFF AND THEN BLADE (Goyer's third Blade, which he directed, SUCKED) AND NOW BATMAN. WHY DO THEY HIRE THIS MAN??????? People, this movie was terrible in terms of WHAT THEY COULD'VE DONE WITH THE MATERIAL!!!! If Nolan decided to do a third, he should FIRE himself because he cannot direct comic movies and TURF GOYER!!!!! There are some fine ideas in this film but they are masked by the garbage. The bank scene is great but the subsequent ones fail to deliver. All in all, I WISH I liked this movie. But if left me suspicious of a third and slightly hoping they'll reboot it again. I thought Bale was a great choice for the mantle but he phoned this performance in. If he doesn't step it up, get someone else or start over. Ugh."
tt0114934,"During the Nazi era, a Jewish woman on the run takes a trolley which passes near the Warsaw ghetto, where the uprising battle is taking place, and some passengers are struck by stray bullets. They take temporary refuge in an empty building, and there she has a chance meeting with her ex-fianc√©. He offers to put her up--that is, hide her--for a few days. He's now married, a professional who lives in an idyllic suburb reached by a trolley that runs through the woods. His wife seems more committed to putting up the fugitive than he is. The story involves the neighbors, the building owner who avoids involvement and seeks solace in classic poetry, and the super and his suspicious wife.This is certainly one of Wajda's major films, but it apparently did not get a favorable reception from any faction (Jews, Poles, etc.) and one can see why. It isn't an easy film: it tackles a difficult subject and doesn't provide any facile answers or try to provoke a simple emotional response. And the characters are not especially likable.The central character is a man who knows what's right and even DOES what's right at the cost of his life, but still isn't very sympathetic. He has no zest for taking a principled stand, and he has a certain lack of empathy. A key scene is where his younger brother, romantically attracted to the underground, goes off to his possible death fighting in the ghetto. The husband doesn't understand why his wife is crying, and only sees his pesky younger brother's unexplained (to him) departure as a relief. In short, he's like a lot of us. In films where characters are faced with strong moral choices, right and wrong are usually clearly defined. Wajda understands that it's not as simple as that. I saw this film 9 years ago, but this character often returns to my mind.Wajda is not badly represented in the DVD/tape market, but the emphasis is on his earlier films. This is one of the later ones that's sadly not available. It deserves a wider audience."
tt0372784,"Batman Begins is the latest film entry in the Warner Brothers Batman franchise that I've been looking forward to, even while my interest was marginally low as a Batman comic fan (I contemplated skipping the movie). I own Batman Black & White, Batman: A Death in the Family, et al and I enjoy reading the comics immensely for well-constructed stories. I thought Christopher Nolan's new vision of the rise of Bruce Wayne as a cleverly intelligent billionaire playboy and a valiant crime fighter would herald the beginning of a promising new Batman movie franchise after the abominable failure of Batman & Robin.After the screening, I had difficulty evaluating the quality of the film - flat-out mediocre, weakly fair or shockingly bad. I attribute my disappointing impression to the one fatal flaw that ruined the film for me, as far as the movie-going experience is concerned: editing.Batman Begins is the distant cousin to Armageddon. Editing is what totally ruined the movie experience for me when it kept visually pummeling the viewer who was trying to follow the story amidst bizarrely chaotic action, marginal character development and fairly impressive direction by Nolan.Don't get me wrong, Batman Begins is close to being a good quality movie on the surface level. It's good to be different that spurn the conventional norms to make a truly unique film. But the crime at the scene pointing to the fatal outcome is maddeningly pretentious MTV-lite editing style that killed my interest in what happens in the movie. Some of the action scenes are so chaotic it's confounding and difficult to follow coherently from scene to scene. I thought Edward Scissorhands was brought in to become O.D. on the combined in-take of cocaine, speed and caffeine in editing the film to shreds to render it barely watchable for those who rise above the general audience's attention span of a goldfish.Batman Begins starts differently pertaining to the development of the main protagonist Bruce Wayne. At this stage, I thought the movie is going in the right direction that stands to purge the bad memory of enduring Batman & Robin at a sold-out movie screening the opening night in June 1997. But as the film progress, the film editing takes precedence in how the visual style should look. It may represent the fast-paced action of the latest comic book series, but for me it gave me a migraine headache. And the film got too predictable. There are the plot points in which I correctly guessed to be divulged, although I liked the creatively constructed plot twists towards the ending. It's fair enough to develop the story to take in the wholly fresh new direction, but I didn't find it compelling because it's very clich√©d.Christian Bale shines throughout the film in spite of the excessively self-indulgent editing. He's a damned good actor and he shows that he can carry the movie without bearing a burden on his shoulders. The supporting actors in the film are basically cardboard cutouts as fairly underdeveloped characters suffering the savage hands of the auteur hack editor Lee Smith with the approved oversight by Mr. Nolan. No emotional impact and attachment whatsoever. Katie Holmes is close to terrible as District Attorney Rachel Dawes in Batman Begins - courtesy of Dawson's Creek acting school. No chemistry whatsoever, either - so bland it makes William Shatner's interactive chemistry with Kirstie Alley in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan seem convincing. Furrowing your eyebrows and pretending to be too serious do not equal good acting. Katie Holmes's miscasting is one of the worst flaws that undermine the film besides rotten caffeine-induced editing. And the ending is so blatant in its opening a slot for a sequel that it felt tacky instead of subliminal.Batman Begins is a forgettable film typical of the summer blockbuster movie mentality. The only memorable sequence is Morgan Freeman & Christian Bale test-driving a pre-modified custom-built Thundertank...er, Batmobile and it was amusing to watch as it pokes fun of itself with a self-acknowledged wink of humor.Christopher Nolan did a fine job speculating on the legacy of Batman's beginning, but the editing basically destroyed the film so it registers a negative response from a jaded moviegoer like me. Christopher Nolan and his team of editors should watch Ingmar Bergman's Fanny & Alexander and The Seventh Seal for noble film art in slow-burn psychological character development intensity with slow-moving but precise editing and learn what can be artful while developing an otherwise overwhelmingly commercial film.Batman Begins is worth seeing in a dollar theater. Otherwise, it's a waste of hard-earned money for a brief, limp escapade of following Bruce Wayne's adventure and vendetta with lesser psychological and visceral impact than expected.** out of four"
tt0114369,"At times, the movie felt somewhat drawn out to me. Most of the details and scenes were necessary to the buildup, but I felt it could've been done in a more concise manner. The setting and feel of the first 3/4 of the movie also began to feel repetitive and, at times, boring.With that said, the acting and plot in this movie were fantastic-especially the latter. The grand finale, which transpires over the last 20 minutes, deserves a 10/10 rating. Truly chilling the way it all comes together at the end. If it were all accomplished with a bit more brevity I think the desired effect would have been even more powerful."
tt1345836,"After spending the first part of the day rewatching two of my favourites, Batman Begins and then The Dark Knight, we rushed to get comfortable in our seats and watch the 'conclusion' to Christopher Nolan's Batman series. My friends and I had high hopes and formidable confidence that the director would not let us down. Forty odd minutes in I knew something must be wrong. I was not enjoying the film. What was wrong with me? Over an hour passed and I still hadn't swallowed the pill that countless others had. It wasn't me; it was in fact the story. Or questioning lack of. Epic? Maybe in scale of extra's, explosions, soundtrack and length. Einstein's theory of relativity on excellent display here. I really could not wait for it to end. Then it did. For a moment anyway before it pushed up the Return of the King gear and overstayed its encore.Story, that which is so paramount in the first two of Nolan's take on Batman was lost completely in some terrible dialogue and loud explosions. I'm trying hard here not to put any direct spoilers in and ruin it for those yet to see the film, so you will obviously make up your own mind and really be disappointed like myself or see The Emperor's New Clothes.Minor characters from the first two films are either quickly pushed aside or ignored completely. One character in particular, one for the audience to connect with and our moral compass is lost to one half of the film. Greatly missed.Catwoman, beautiful and well enough portrayed by Anne Hathaway with what little story there was to work with, why was she there? The part could have easy been filled by any number of Banes associates be it the brains that pay him to be a thug or the brawlers who worship him.As for Bane, portrayed with such exuberance by Tom Hardy was the high point of the piece. I really enjoyed all his scenes and interactions with Batman. It's hard to find an actor who can convey so much through just with his eyes; Tom Hardy manages it with ease, giving a realistic frightening performance that demands attention.Again, I don't want to put any spoilers in so I'll wrap it up here. If you wanted to see an intelligent, thought provoking story in the ilk of the first two films you will be disappointed. Story and structure are forgotten and replaced with Michael Bay explosions and loud bangs. I have no problem against such films; I just didn't expect to find it here. I was bored and extremely disappointed, for me, there will only be the first two films. This will fall into the abyss with Die Hard 4.0 and Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull. Oh, and Robocop 3."
tt0068646,"I watched this film because it had a high user rating. I don't get why people find it a good film. For me, it was just a film about people, a family, killing other people. I couldn't take much more away from it than that, sorry. Shawshank is a much better film in every respect. The Godfather is long and drawn out and although it is one of the better gangster films, I would have to say that it is not one that I will watch again. Please let there be someone that agrees with me. From the reviews that I have read there doesn't seem to be a good reason to suggest why this film is voted number one, something that really puzzles me. There are no twists, little to think about, and the film hardly makes you feeling better at the end of it, does it? I've seen much better films than the Godfather although I'm sure, as I seem to be going against popular opinion, I will get heavily criticized for these comments."
tt0139414,"Lake Placid falls somewhere on the spectrum between Jaws and Piranha - admittedly closer to Piranha - and rounds out the handful of decent animals-gone-rogue movies of the end of last century (Anaconda, Deep Blue Sea, etc). It's more entertaining/fun than straight horror, I've found myself reaching for it on the occasional Saturday morning. Oliver Platt, Brendan Gleeson & Betty White make it truly worthwhile. Disappointing Bridget Fonda plays such a shrill neurotic though."
tt0468569,"There seems to be a lot of hype about this film. As I write it's sitting at #6 with an average rating of 9.0. Honestly, I don't think it's that good. Heath Ledger is fun as the psychopathic side of the joker, but I'm not sure he's any more enjoyable than Jack Nicholson - where, for instance, are the actual jokes? Michael Caine just is NOT Alfred - butlers should speak much more correctly than that, and the cockney boy just doesn't work for me. Christian Bale doesn't seem solid enough as a Bruce Wayne. It's a bit more jolly than the Tim Burton efforts - there is at least daylight this time - and the plot twists and effects are decent, but I don't think they're particularly ground-breaking. All in all I'd say it's watchable, but I don't expect it to hang around in the top 10 for too long."
tt0167261,"In a totally fictitious Middle Ages, peopled by men, elves,monsters, dwarfs, moving trees and other more or less strange beings, another episode of the eternal struggle between Good and Evil unfolds itself in a succession of fantasy and dream sceneries where terror and poetry combine in a fantastic symbiosis. On the other hand some dialogues and monologues as well as some characters reach an almost Shakespearean grandeur. This movie has some images of rare beauty and some others which fill us with awe and wonder. And what about the story? Well the story is the weakest part of all this with the usual plot flaws and a lot of unlikely facilities in the outcome of certain plot scenes about which I will not dwell now to avoid being a spoiler. But who cares after all? The usual spectator of this kind of movies only wants to be recreated during the projection time and devoted to all the emotions that the various incidents produce in his mind. It's therefore intrinsically one more movie aimed at entertaining the spectator and not at making him think or at conveying any message beyond the simple one according to which Good must always triumph over Evil."
tt0468569,"Too long, too dark, and too serious. The darkness is unavoidable - but exacerbated by the length, and the fact that for a movie about a superhero, it is entirely too serious. No matter how hard we try, the idea of a superhero is still a bit crazy. Imagine Bill Gates or Warren Buffet as superheroes - it's silly. So why does the film take itself so seriously? Also, it seems that the Batman story slips to the side in parts, as though the film is intent on tackling too many issues all at once. This isn't said to be contrary - the movie can be legitimately difficult to watch. It's simply too long for the content. It's not a bad film - but it's not an all-time great either."
tt0120815,The opening scene promises much and it's great and dramatic. But far from realistic. It can't be possible to shoot the Germans using a mirror. I can't help but wonder where are the British in this film? Americans didn't won the war all by themselves.The way Germans are portrayed is stupid. To one dead American there are 5 dead Germans. How could the Germans invade almost half of Europe if they are so lousy fighters? Visually the movie is great but the story is unbelievable and the whole movie is way too patriotic. Why would anyone send many men to save one guy? It would have been much easier to contact private Ryan's superiors and send the guy back home. And the scene where captain Miller dies is just a big clich√©.
tt0313792,"The word that comes to mind when describing this film is ""MISCASTED"". Christina Ricci seems absolutely disassociated from her character. Often there is no passion behind her speech, even though her role is that of a severely disturbed person. She is obviously supposed to have Bulimia, but the mood swings and the intensity that come with that traumatizing mental affliction are no where to be found. Autism would suit her portrayal of Amanda better then Bulimia. In a word- wooden.Jason Biggs, who plays Jerry, is about as authentic and comfortable in his role as the actors in the late-night paid programming ads. He simply cannot play the part of a intellectual, troubled, writer. He acts the same as he did in American Pie- an eager, befuddled, socially inapt young adult trying to become comfortable with the world before he is even comfortable with himself, but then it was the source of comedy and in Anything Else it merely detracts. Not one of his scenes or bits of dialogue seemed authentic or believable.Both Biggs and Ricci may be able to, in part, pass the buck to Woddy Allen's screen writing. The pretentious verbiage seemed like suitable dialogue for ""Dawson's Creek: College Years"". It was a cheap tool of bad writing: instead of developing the characters into urban intellectuals just have them use big words and small little ones. Additionally, the film waxed philosophical obnoxiously. It wasn't subtle at all, but as overt as guy nudging you going ""Do ya get it? Do ya get it? Existentialism!"" If only this film had contained any interesting existential themes worth noting it may have been more bearable. Instead Existentialism was reduced to name dropping. Jason Biggs pondering on the fact that as humans we have to confront our own mortality with a sprinkle of Sarte and a dash of Camus is neither insightful or effective.Nor was Amanda's eating disorder very useful, well-handled, or in good taste. From the beginning it is obvious that she has an eating disorder (it appears to be Bulimia), but that is really all that can be said about it. None of the characters acknowledge it, nor does it really serve any purpose in furthering the narrative or making the characters and drama more complex and compelling. The only reasonable conclusion seems to be that the audience are the only people that know she has it which, if it's trying to, doesn't build to anything. There are many such loose ends in this movie. In some ways it trivializes eating disorders which are incredibly serious and deadly.While the majority of the movie was a waste replete with crap irony, I must say that there were some good nuggets. Danny DeVito, playing Jerry's manager, was the best actor in it and he did a good job; he was funny, entertaining- he was Danny Devito. There were also some great gems of dialogue, mostly spoken by DuBelle (Allen), which indicates that Allen hasn't completely lost his edge.Just some useless trivia (not a spoiler)- at the end when Biggs says, ""I guess Dubelle's seminal joke was that: Even a stopped clock is right twice a day."" That stopped clock bit is actually from Whitnail and I, unless it was first written somewhere before that movie (1987). The juxtaposition of that with Dubelle's lines right before is, at least, cerebrally comical."
tt0120815,"Visually, the best WW2 movie. In other ways, far from the best. The movie is loaded with errors and falls into demonizing the German soldier and praising the American. A few examples, far from the reality the combat scenes show the Germans acting like cattle without ANY strategy at all they just run and shout, one funny part is the behavior of the German tankers, they drive in a ruined village in a VERY narrow street, like they have never heard of ambush! -One starts to think if the script writer has ever heard ofthe capabilities of the German panzer crews, SS-Captain Michael Wittmann attacked and destroyed 48 armored fighting vehicles alone in a single action! The most absurd part is the -""Macgyver/Rambo scene""-when Capt. Miller and friends start to throw the mortar grenades slaughtering a few dozen Germans. The most unforgivable error is that there were NO SS-units with Tiger tanks operational in Normandy at this point of time. This movie is way overestimated."
tt0167261,"The epic saga of Middle Earth continues in this very good sequel to Fellowship. In fact, I think it's the best of the trilogy. I enjoyed it even more because I knew a bit more about the characters and the story. I must admit that I haven't read the books.The special effects are once again great and the battle scenes are spectacular. I wouldn't say this is one of the 10 best movies ever made, but it's still very entertaining. And I think it really has to be seen on a big screen to be fully appreciated. I also liked the humor brought by characters like Gimli. But Gollum was a bit too present in the movie. My favorite characters: Arwen (Liv Tyler), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Too bad that the Arwen and Galadriel characters are not more important.Out of 100, I gave it 88. That's good for ***¬Ω out of ****.Seen in Toronto, at the Famous Players Paramount Cinemas, on January 19th, 2003."
tt0816692,"Having destroyed all resources on the planet, like a rapacious, insatiable gannet, it's time to move on, to vacate and be gone, find a new place to rampage and beset. But where can you take all the people, to build their new churches and steeples, and how to get there, if you can find somewhere, without a breakthrough in science and maths rules.Juxtaposing a more than probabilistic forecast of things to come with the absurd, to produce a wholly engaging and imaginative piece of sci-fi that may well get you thinking of what might just happen to the planet and the people of it when the help and support of as yet undiscovered dimensions fails to materialise.Great performances, great effects, leaves you wanting to revisit 2001: A Space Odyssey but you know you'll never know why."
tt0137523,"( May Spoil (WARNING) ) I seen this in the theater's when it came out in 99'. I payed $7.00 dollars to see it. The second i found out ""The Secret"". I wanted to beat someone up all right.

This is so slapstick - with really bad dialogue - that nothing here is to be taken seriously. This will appeal to fans of slapstick only. It was just so terrible, I didn't even find it funny, so I had no joy with this as a comedy or as a horror, or a film in general...I literally cringed a bit with every single scene. Nothing about the film was interesting, exciting or remotely entertaining. The film played like a very bad episode of 'Will & Grace' - with bad acting, oh and that dreadful dialogue!!! Aaaarrgggghhhhh!!!"
tt0114369,"**CONTAINS SPOILERS**Perhaps it's the timing. Three weeks ago I might have reacted differently to this movie. But right now I just have little tolerance for the way it takes genuine horror and evil and creates a stylish, but ultimately empty, Hollywood package out of it.This film is about a sadistic killer who is choosing his victims and methods of death based on the seven deadly sins (hence the title of the movie). On his trail are two detectives, a young hotshot named David Mills (Brad Pitt) and a senior Homicide Lieutenant, William Somerset, (Morgan Freeman) who has become cynical almost to the point of burnout. The murders are carried out with extreme cruelty, although the violence is not actually shown being committed, it is depicted quite graphically by what the two men discover at each crime scene, as well as in the various photos, coroner's reports, etc., that they examine. To be blunt, this is NOT for the squeamish, in fact, I'm surprised this film didn't get an NC-17 rating.Anyway, the bodies pile up, and despite their best efforts (including a very close encounter by Mills), the killer, known only as `John Doe', remains at large. In fact, we don't even see him at all until halfway through the film, and we don't see him close up until near the end. Which is, basically, where this otherwise well crafted film falls apart.At this point, five victims have already been discovered. In a strange plot twist, Mr. Doe turns himself in, them makes a bizarre offer. In return for a full confession, he requests the two detectives accompany him, alone and unarmed, so he can show them the final two victims. Obviously he has something really shocking planned as his grand finale, and, given his extremely high level of intelligence shown to date, only a fool would accept such a proposal at face value. Yet accepted it is, and all three men end up alone in the desert, the scene set for the final horror.   (Warning: BIG spoiler ahead)On the drive out, Doe has been taunting Mills relentlessly, setting up the big showdown in which Somerset is handed a package containing the severed head of Mills' wife, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. At this point, Doe springs the trap. With a sneer, he informs Mills that the head represents the sin of envy, namely the killer's envy of Mills' heretofore charmed life. Of course, the sinner will pay for his sin, and in the process bring down the final victim, Mills himself, whose sin is wrath. Somerset, who understands the situation fully as soon as he opens the box, tries in vain to prevent what he knows is inevitable. Mills struggles to fight off his natural desire to kill Doe, knowing if he does, the killer wins his twisted game, but in the end he cannot help it. The film ends with Mills being driven off, presumably in handcuffs, in the back of a squad car. No matter what happens to him now, his life has been utterly destroyed. Much as with the suicide bombers of September 11th, we are left with the sense of the sneering triumph of evil over good, of a twisted life of hate given solely for the purpose of destruction.So, what is the point of this film? There isn't one, as far as I can tell. There's no moral here, only psychosis and brutality artfully rendered. It's an appeal to cynicism, to shock value for its own sake. I suppose we are expected to react by noting that the ending was `cool' or at the very least, `original'. Yeah, right. And the really disgusting part is that this isn't some low budget slasher flick, but a top quality production with big name stars. A lot of thought, effort and talent went into making this film, but the end result is something that deserves to be flushed down a toilet."
tt0167261,"I loved the Fellowship of the Ring and was greatly anticipating this film. This film however did not have nearly the same wow effect as the first movie. Effects in this movie are defenitly top notch and it makes the movie worth seeing just for the huge scale of the battles but other than that I thought this movie had far less substance. The best part of the movie is Golem, he is spectacular and who can't love him? Unfortunately he was the only character in this movie I found myself caring about. About all you get from Gimliy and Legalos are a BOMBARDMENT of simply awful jokes. Going alongside the wall at helms deep WAS humorous when you come by Gimliy not being able to see over the wall, yet like all the good humor in this movie they immediately destroy the joke by over doing it, ""Shall I fetch you a box."" No thanks Mr. Elf I would prefer a mute button. Going back to Gimliy again, I found it very annoying that Treebeard's voice was done by the same actor, this however wont bother most of you... hopefully. The battles for the most part are epic and truelly spectacular, yet they throw in many scenes that make me cringe and want to look away, also in this movie I had trouble believing in ""the reality of the movie"". Examples include... - Legolas was taking out the Orcs and there ride (large beast creatures) with one arrow a piece... they were moving... really fast, This I am fine with but when he get's off two shots at the Orc with the torch resembling a character from The Road Warrior and doesn't put him down... something is wrong. This is also the same character that said when the Orcs were a rather far distance from Helmsdeep to aim for there Necks and Underarms. This brings me to my next and biggest complaint with our elf friend. - Legalos told them to shoot at the Necks etc. because that is where there armor is the weakest. Well there armor does absolutely nothing against shields tossed with feet. The scene that I am talking about where Legolas slides down the stairs is so awfull I don't want to see the movie again if I have to watch that. I was fine with all of legolas' other little tricks but this is completely stupid. It truelly takes away a lot of the serious atmosphere this battle had and turned it into trash. These people are defending there families and I can't take that seriously when I have elf man sliding away. - The central Characters are far to powerfull in this movie. When Aragorn and Gimliy can cover the bridge swarming with orcs by themselves something 30 some people couldn't do it's hard to accept -When the men who capture Frodo and Sam kill the back half of that large army of men, why did the front half completely ignore what was going on? -And finally... there is no was I can believe that not a single person wasn't able to spot either Sam or Frodo when they were at the Gates of Mordor. There little cloaks were not enough to have shielded them from sight and sound with how much running around they did around there.I suggest when you see this movie you simply accept all of its oddness and not ""nitpick"" like me. I do think the movie is GOOD but it is far from great and IMHO not worthy of a Best Picture nomination."
tt1345836,"So Let's see, The Conclusion to Chris Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. Starting with Batman Begins which was a great movie that pioneered the new wave of superhero films with blockbuster action and near art house philosophy with superheroes at the center. It took the concept of fear and turning it into power. Then came what is considered Nolan's greatest work, The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight brought in an engaging villain, ideas of anarchy vs control, real tragedy and analysis on what it takes to turn a hero to the dark side. Then came this movie...Well I personally don't care for it. It's long and pretentious and has loads of laughable moments. Bruce Wayne is written to be a little annoying and out of character. There are GAPING plot holes, nonsensical writing and odd creative decisions.First, what I like about the movie: Bane and Cat-woman. Bane is great. Tom Hardy is a great actor. He can be just a little hard to understand at times but did a great job nonetheless with an intelligent yet intimidating portrayal. That said, the character he played was Bane, in name only. No characteristics were taken from the comics otherwise. Cat-woman is great and that's all I can say. Her scenes are the most fun to watch in the movie.So where did the movie go wrong? Well, it has a lot to say but never takes the time to say it. It's also over 2 and a half hours long, which I don't usually mind but the editing and pacing are very hectic. It never takes the time to examine it's characters. Batman is a whiny recluse now and that character change plays no real part in the story later.The Batman voice is even more annoying in this one. The plot of the Dark Knight is made completely useless. They could have skipped that movie and gone to this one and everything would have been fine. the only remnant is Bruce Wayne's trauma (which goes NOWHERE) and the Dent act which caused peace (which goes NOWHERE). Things they could have cut out of the movie to save time since they clearly lengthened the movie ad cut bits and pieces everywhere.Bane has an overly complicated plan that involves (yet is not limited to) stealing Bruce Wayne's fingerprints, bankrupting him, breaking batman and throwing him into prison, destroying the city for the next 5 months, taking over the city and revealing the lies of commissioner Gordan, using tech from Wayne industries to break open black gate prison, then nuking the city. In that exact order. Why not just break Batman then nuke the city?Some Questions: If Bane has Bruce's fingerprints why is he stealing his tech? And why bankrupt him if you're just going to throw him in a pit and take over the city anyway? What is Bane's motivation really? He says the criminals are oppressed by the government but never explains how. His MO keeps changing though out the movie really Why is he attacking Gotham and claiming it needs to be saved like this when the first 30 minutes established Gotham is perfectly fine and at ""peace time""? If you're going to say because the commissioner lied about Two-face you'd be wrong because the league of shadows has no problem with lying and deceit to gain power (evidenced by Batman Begins and this movie). Why put Batman, WORLDS GREATEST DETECTIVE, in a prison A CHILD once escaped from? Why keep him alive anyway? The entire ""your punishment must be more severe"" line has no logic in it. The league of shadows kills its enemies but now it just keeps the most dangerous ones alive?Talia al Ghul appears. I have issues with this. Why do her and Bruce Suddenly start having sex completely out of nowhere when they've JUST met? she says she hated her father for banishing Bane but still wants to carry out his plan. WHY? Why send EVERY policeman in Gotham to fight Bane in the sewers? couldn't they have gassed the sewer instead or kept some officers on the surface?Aside from those questions, there is really no chemistry between Bruce and Talia or Batman and Cat-woman or Bane and Talia. These romances happen without any prior indication and just confused me.It's not very faithful to the comics, but Nolan never wanted it to be anyway. I don't mind that and the other 2 movies did it pretty well, but in this case it's so far from the comics that there's no reason for this to be a Batman film. NONE. Other than the costumes. Where is the detective work? Where is the use of intelligence? Where is the dark atmosphere? most of this movie happens in the day time. Where's the noir feel that Batman is known for? Bane is nothing like this in the comics and for that matter neither is Talia.But I'd let that slide if the plot made logical sense. Bane's and Talia's deaths are both completely lackluster scenes. The ending was predictable and foreshadowed heavily by both Lucius Fox and Alfred. And speaking of the ending... BATMAN DOESN'T QUIT!!!!! WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS THAT ABOUT? ONE OF THE MAIN FOCUSES OF THE COMICS IS BATMAN'S OBSESSION WITH CRIME AND HOW IT CONSUMES HIS LIFE!! HE STAYS BATMAN TILL OLD AGE. It might sound nit- picky but it's a major trait that batman has.There's just so much wrong with this movie. It has great scenes but they don't make sense in terms of the over-all film. Things aren't really explained very well either. to each their own I guess. This was not for me."
tt0167260,"This part three of the trilogy was boring. It was geared to overaged adolescents who love vicarious fights...with digital demons. Ho hum. ""Enough! I wanted to shout,"" ""We Get IT! They had to fight!! Get this blinkin' film over with! I surrender!!""And just when you thought your bum would see the light of day again, wham, ANOTHER ending! My mother and father once (in pre Vatican III days) attended an Italian Catholic high mass wedding. Being Quakers to boot, they had no idea they should have ordered out for pizza and left a wake up call. Each time the congregation rose, they breathed their own silent ""Thank God"" and started to file out, but the guests then en masse kneeled, addressed a different station of the cross,and off things went for another hour.""The Return of the King"" echoed that oft told experience to me. And I wasn't even in a theater. I could have left at any time, but where to file out to at 1AM? It became an ordeal, my own quest to see the turkey through.Now I ask you, Peter Jackson, WHY all the endings??Another thing I noticed in the DVD versions of these three movies; the guy who played Aragon did not do commentary, and did not appear to be pleased with the whole deal to me. He and Liv Taylor had zero chemistry, and I got the sensation he was glad to be done with it. Did anyone else catch this?If I had seen one more, just one more, animated monster, I would have...well, I can't think of anything worse than sitting through the whole darn movie, and I did that anyway, so I will end this diatribe on that note."
tt1375666,"This movie never gets old! Of Christopher Nolan's movies, it is the one i have watched the most outside of The Dark Knight! This really feels like a movie that only he could make! A mind bogling mix of ideas and creativity, as the concept of dreams are told to the viewer in a way, so that it never becomes too much! This is one of those movies that hooks you from beginning to end!The plot is engaging and you never know what to expect as the movie builds up and becomes more and more intense and thrilling! This is also a journey of guilt, confronting yourselves and learning to move on! Directing is amazing with some truelly iconic scenes such as the hallway fight which is expertly made and filmed! Soundtrack is equally great and iconic!Great actors who all does a great job! Lots of talent! The ending still remains one of my favorite movie endings of all time! This is a once in a lifetime experience that you dont wanna miss!"
tt0109830,"I have watched this movie in Spanish class when I was in high school. At first I didn't like it , but towards the end I did. The way he portrayed his character was really good. I didn't expect for him to do that. I love how he got his accent down. It was really a nice movie to watch. It was entertaining but then again boring for me to watch because I didn't really understand it. I would recommend it to anyone else though if they like movies like that. Even if they just want to see him play someone else for a change. Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors. This is one of his best films, the one I like best I think is the one where he was on the beach. Cast away"
tt1345836,"And we end off with a...... Bang?Not really...but there are still moments from this movie that i enjoy and that id anne hathaway and that's about it haha.I think the ending is cheesy (other then when Gordon finally finds out who batman is)the villain should have been Ras Al Ghul, it would've been a huge callback to the first film and it would've made Batman's ""death"" a bigger success and twist when it's revealed he isn't actually dead at the end of the filmgood overall, worst entry though."
tt0102926,This movie is awful. What most people don't know about this movie this that it is a sequel. This is based on the second book Thomas Harries wore about Hannibal L.e.c.t.e.r. His first book Red dragon was fist made into a movie in 1986. It is called man Man hunter. It is very scary. And this one is just overrated crap. The third one Hannibal is better. And that one is pretty bad. There is the Man hunter remake that people think is a prequel Red dragon. That is one of the scariest movies ever made. And this just crap. The prequel Hannibal rising is better. And that was not very good. For a movie that was supposed to be scarier Then A nightmare on elm street (1984) and Friday the 13th (1980) I was very disappointed. The best thing about this movie is that it is a precursors to Red dragon. This movie is badly written and has an awful ending. They was good actors in it and they wasted there talent being in this crap. The only reason any one a generation older me like is because of who is in it. Anthony Hopkins can do no wrong in the eye of a lot of people. This movie is not scary at all. It is just stupid. It is a pile of pooh pooh. Do not wast time and money. Don't see this awful movie.
tt0102926,"This may seems a masterpiece for some of us, but why.? What's the point? . Anthony Hopkins could only scare ""Jodie"" who is trying her best to be get scared by Anthony. Close up shots and big eyes didn't work for me. Not Oscar worthy either. Were not there any good movies at that time?.I gave it a shot because I thought this would make me feel alike Mads mikkelssen's Hannibal.I can't get my 2 hrs back."
tt7286456,"I wonder why DC licensed the brand to Todd n Co. The character (Arthur Fleck) never creates any chaos by himself, no manipulation n threat stuff, no explosions, no gunpowders. In short, there's very little this Joker does other than just borrowing the costume and signature laugh from the iconic character. Of course one could argue that it's a character in it's early stages before transforming into the supervillain. But then what's the fun in watching just another psychopath movie with a troubled psychotic patient getting bullied and disregarded by society. Honestly, I've seen a ton of movies with a similar plot. To make matter worse, the character doesn't even turn a villain at the end of the movie. JOKER is a mediocre attempt psychotic thriller movie which doesn't do justice to the title. The movie could've worked better as an independent film without the unnecessary portrayal of the legendary character."
tt0361748,"I was prepared to write something really mean this time. It was supposed to be about Tarantino wanting us to giggle once again together with the sadist inside us. Giggle about the lynch justice, the reptile morality and the sometimes rather stomach turning violence.But once again I was seduced. Not at least by the dialogues, which go on not only for 5 minutes, but for 10 or nearly 15 minutes. And I promise, even the most shallow action addict will sit quiet, not wanting to miss a word. That's focus, that's great movie-making.But the story is certainly the worst ever by Tarantino, although told in a much clever way. When he leaves the retaliation morals of a 14-year-old, he will not just perform great movie-making. He will also make good films."
tt1345836,"Granted, I found the first Nolan Batman to be overblown, dull, trite, and a bit silly (does Christian Bale really need to talk in the Batman voice like that? Thank goodness they made fun of that on South Park), and the second to be a bit better I suppose, but the third might be the worst of all.And the fact that there are those claiming it was ""perfection"" or ""flawless"" must have either seen a different film than I or are taking their job in the studio's marketing dept. way too seriously (most likely the latter).Let's forget Bale's awful voice work which has marred the entire Batman legacy throughout these three films (there continues to be one Batman and his name is Michael Keaton; I'd rue the thought of how the latter-day Burton would ruin the series further, but his initial two remain some of the last great masterpieces of commercial/studio film to be consigned to celluloid in the last era).Why did Bane need to sound the way HE did? I tell you, I'm not expecting cogent story lines or apt character development from a film like this or from Nolan, but as soon as Bane started talking in the first two minutes of the film, my girlfriend and I turned to each other and knew right away we were in trouble.Forgetting the fact he sounds like an arch-villain from an early 80s action cartoon (or an American Sean Connery, perhaps), whomever did the technical work on his ADR really dropped the ball. You can tell easily that his voice was incorporated into the soundtrack in a way wholly different from everyone else in the film. He sounds like he's talking in voice over the entire time. Yikes. If this movie gets nominated for Best Sound Editing, I'll know the Academy has absolutely no credence at all anymore.Other technical and editing faults spiral throughout the film. I blame Nolan again for this, as so many of the scenes in which characters are talking to each other are clearly edited poorly. Really took me out of the film. And, again, I'm not looking for artistry in a shoot-em up comic book movie made for acne-face'd teenagers, but one would think the filmmakers would AT LEAST get the spectacle/technical aspects of the thing right. Shame. Lazy work all around.The acting was, as usual for these films, subpar except for possibly Gary Oldman who for once didn't have a slew of clich√© comic book/TV lines to spout (""Gotta get me one of THOSE!"" Yich).Then, of course, there's the many, many, many plot holes that are truly just befuddling. Namely the fact that we have an underground prison that is a central focus of the film and is supposed to be enshrouded in pure darkness, is to be ""Hell on Earth,"" and one of the worst -- if not THEE worst -- places someone can be exiled to... and yet whenever they show the actual place, it's well-lit and the folks who ""live"" there seem nothing but nice, as though inhabiting a communal little village in which you have doctors and gurus and mentors helping each other out. WHY is this place a Hell on Earth that would spawn ""pure evil"" like Bane? I couldn't figure that one out.(And without giving any spoilers, the way out of the place was so obvious -- even to the prisoners themselves -- that it makes one wonder why more of the prisoners don't just up and leave.)You also have the total unreality of a booming metropolis under complete lockdown for like six months and yet everyone still somehow has electricity, water, heat, food, makeup, clean clothes, etc. and even a relatively chipper attitude throughout? I would've thought Gotham would digress into Lord of the Flies pretty quickly, but apparently everyone just stays traditionally phlegmatic in Nolan's yawningly dull cinemaverse.(Not to mention a police force stuck underground who seem to be kinda fine with that after months of no light or clean bathroom facilities.)Sorry, there's suspension of disbelief and then there's just bafflingly lazy writing mixed with lobotomized audience members.As with the first Batman, I was also so incredibly bored for the first hour or so trying to stay awake for Nolan's signature needlessly convoluted, chaotically discursive, and haplessly disorganized ""plot""lines that rather than being fooled like the illiterates who found this movie to somehow be better than Sunset Blvd, The Professional, or Once Upon a Time in the West according to the IMDb score they gave it, I knew -- yet again -- that Nolan is no genius but only a comic book enthusiast who thinks he's making a two-hour TV drama.And two hours were two hours too long here. Even when the movie finally picked up with some action about halfway through (aside from the loud and obnoxious first few seconds that might as well have been one explosion before moving into the doldrums for the next interminable sixty minutes), I had trouble keeping awake, wondering how much longer this seemingly five-hour marathon would go on for.Why didn't I leave sooner? Because $20 for an IMAX ticket is too much to step away from in this day and age and I thought MAYBE there would be some kind of pay-off in the end (there really wasn't; it goes pretty much where you think it would go).So, in conclusion: 1) Fair to poor acting, 2) Awful sound design and voice work, 3) Shoddy/lazy technical logistics, 4) Meandering and hopelessly disorganized script -- surprise -- 5) And, sadly for an action film whose one goal is to entertain popcorn flick style, BORING."
tt0167261,"Peter Jackson himself has admitted The Two Towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve, at least in terms of narrative structure since, unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax (Boromir's death in Fellowship was one of that film's most moving moments). It picks up exactly from where its predecessor ended: the Fellowship is split in three separate groups, all with their own problems to take care of:Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring, and find an unexpected guide in that item's previous owner, vicious creature Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reunite with the reborn Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) to save the dying kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's (Christopher Lee) evil clutch; Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have a close encounter with the Ents, ancient creatures which have unfinished business with a certain bad wizard...This second opus is less talking and more fighting: key characters are reduced to cameos (most notably Galadriel) and new people are quickly introduced so that we can be dragged into some huge battles, culminating in the 40-minute long combat at Helm's Deep, quite simply the movie's highlight. If, however, you want more insight on the characters and their motivations, get the extended cut, whose additional sequences are essential to understand pivotal moments of the third film.Helm's Deep aside, the movie's most remarkable element is the mad, schizophrenic Gollum. He's got ""ambiguity"" and ""unreliability"" written all over him, as we see him struggle with his two personas, one the good fella he once was, the other a filthy, treacherous freak who wants nothing more than his ""preccciousssss"" back (the conversation between the two personalities is one of the most beautiful scenes ever made). He makes us suspicious about his most insignificant gesture, and has us thinking the worst may happen in The Return of the King.Not as good as the previous part (at least the theatrical version, which I rate 9/10), but still a really good fantasy movie, and one of the best pictures of 2002."
tt0993846,"This is one of those films that will make the smart consumer think about what it means to ""like"" a piece of art work (if you can call Hollywood filmmaking that). Is the film glorifying the horrible crimes that Belfort and his cronies committed, and if so, can one still judge the film and the actors based on their performance and not on the morality of its subject matter? It's difficult, and I respect both types of opinions.Just looking at the film as a fictional story (which I am sure it is, mostly, since Belfort seems to have a knack for embellishing the truth and making a seemingly uninteresting thing the most exciting thing in the world to sell it as best as he can), the plot is rather formulaic for Hollywood standards. Character development is not the main point here, as the characters are larger than life caricatures, even down to the ""boy scout"" FBI guy who has it in for the bad guy (whose motives and story are almost entirely unknown to us, since the story is narrated by Belfort). DiCaprio is in top form, but the rest of the actors and actresses take the prize in genuinely thrilling performances. The acting is probably the best aspect of the film (apart from the glimmer and shine), as every single main and supporting role is played to full potential and perfectly to fit the caricature written out for it.Perhaps the most interesting character is Belfort's number 1, Donnie. We see more character development here, where the nerdy and greedy guy rises to the top and lives a very large life. His morals seem even more lacking than Belfort's, but this is perhaps because Belfort is telling the story.The other interesting, though not novel, part of the story is the role of drugs in Wall Street. Drugs and inevitably sex. It is perhaps alarming that the markets that can ruin our lives by crashing, etc. are run by people who abuse drugs all the time. Belfort is not the one to say this first, and I am sure he won't be the last, either.All in all, the film is ""entertaining,"" if not cringe-worthy. Some moments that are absolutely hilarious in their absurdity can make you cry if you lost a lot of money in the market or lost your job in the recent economic crisis, because in reality, they are not funny. That a company can make billions within hours of a launch, well, that is just sickening no matter what your world view is, unless you are the guy who is making all the money (in which case it is kind of sickening, still, but in a different way).Moralistically, the film is like any art work that deals with humans who commit crimes. I did not find it more glorifying than mafia films where the godfather orders people's deaths ""for the family."" The truth is most humans have a moral understanding and ways to justify their actions according to some moral structure, no matter how twisted or unorthodox the rest of the people might think their structure is. Belfort justified his actions in some ways, and his actions hurt people (including his family), like any other criminal. I did not come away with a message from the film that said ""What Belfort did was awesome!"" It was certainly something more like ""Belfort was successful. His success hurt other people and helped some others. In general, he was an asshole, who did not care much about anyone, but himself and for anything, but getting rich.""The real message is: don't invest your money in the stock market unless you are filthy rich. And even then, don't invest too much of it."
tt0848228,"The good: Robert Downey Jr. is charming as ever. Scarlett Johannsen is delicious as ever. Chris Evans makes a great Captain America. Mark Ruffalo turned in a good performance as David Banner. Samuel Jackson is usual Bad-ass self. Did I leave anyone out? The CGI is up to today's usual high standard. Oh I nearly forgot: The Thor guy was pretty cool too, though why does a Scandinavian God speak with a British Accent?The bad: There's no plot. Loki is a 1-dimensional villain. He ""wants to be king."" He wants people to submit. That's it. That's all there is.I expected more from Joss Whedon, like the incredible reboot J. J. Abrams was able to deliver Star Trek. Damn it! I don't really care much for Star Trek, but Abrams had me nearly crying at the start of that movie.Instead with Avengers we get another paint-by-numbers Superhero movie. You *can* make a Superhero movie with Heart! Look at the original Superman, or more recently Dark Knight and even Kick Ass. I want action and plenty of it, but I also want to connect with the characters on screen.The problem with Avengers is that connection isn't there and there's not a lot happening either. The production values are high, but that's no substitute for a plot. Until the CGI battle at the end, I was a kind of bored."
tt0120737,"It's painfully obvious to me that those who gave this movie 1/10 or 2/10 did it solely for the purpose of trying to knock it down a few notches on the top 250 list in order to bolster their own favorite movie. They didn't even bother to correct their spelling mistakes. Many people also seem to miss the point that Tolkien always meant for his book to be published all at once. It was never meant to be a trilogy. That was the fault of the publisher. They did not wish to publish such a huge volume all at once and therefore split it up into three separate parts. The same was applied to Peter Jackson's movie version of Tolkien's epic. So many people have written that they are confused about the movie yet do not bother to ask themselves why. Why are they confused about the movie? (Yes I consider all 3 movies to be ONE movie) It's because they fail to understand it's complexity and lash out in frustration and anger. But don't worry. These same people may be happier with other movies. God-awful movies which I won't mention. Wait, maybe I will >:) All the Godfather movies, Star Wars Episodes 1, 2, 3, 6, All the Star Trek movies except Wrath of Khan, The Passion of the Christ, Ordinary People (which amazingly actually won an Oscar for best Picture) Titanic (which is astoundingly still on IMDb's top 250 list), Braveheart, ugh the list goes on.Fellowship of the Ring should not be considered as a movie on it's own. It is only PART OF A MOVIE. That being said, one of the confusing issues may be solved. But then again, given people's seemingly in-born tendency to bicker amongst themselves, we haven't seen the last of this ""debate""."

Samsonite (as my eloquent friends calls him) just wasted time and stole peoples money.My only point is: IT'S Tarantino! Should have been so much better than this junk that just USED the name Django!

tt0372784,"I just learned that Memento, this film and The Prestige were all directed by Chris Nolan. I know, ""what, have I been living under a rock or something?"" Right, but, I really liked Memento, a lot. Now, I can see a lot of similarities directorially between the three films once I thought about it. It also occurs to me that one of the things a dislike so much about Batman Begins and The Prestige is that they have so much going for them and they fail to deliver. They both have great actors, good plots for the most part, very good atmosphere and pretty good story telling on some levels. Unfortunately, they all three rely to much on some type of gimmick. Memento was done before the clever twist was so overused which helped it a great deal. It was also done in a particularly clever fashion with the story telling mimicking an aspect of the protagonist's situation. Batman Begins, while it does not rely on one major plot twist, does rely on a series of gimmicks for its main story. Even though this is typical of comic book inspired stories, Nolan does not handle these elements very well and I found it very hard to suspend my disbelief. The same thing happened to me with The Prestige. I think Nolan likes stories that have mostly dark characters that do not have any of the typical redeeming qualities we are used to seeing in main characters in stories. He seems to like characters that allow their obsessions to overtake all the other aspects of their lives. I have to applaud him for being willing to take on these types of characters. However, I think he spends so much time on their dark side that is very difficult for audience members, or, at least for me, to invest any real interest in the outcome of their story. It worked in Memento because the character had a physical flaw that made it difficult for him to deal with his character flaws. In Batman Begins, as well as The Prestige it falls flat.Perhaps it is a sad commentary on the time we live in that these films get the high ratings they do. Maybe very few people are able to believe that there is actually good in most people even some that do bad things. We went from having clear cut heroes, to having the anti-hero, to just having different shades of villains all mixing it up with one or the other arbitrarily winning. I know, the Batman fans out there are saying ""but this is one chapter in a much larger story"". Even though I am a comic book fan I look to the film makers of this genre to make the films episodic for maximum entertainment value. This was very nicely done with the Spiderman series, by the way. On the other hand, Batman Begins doesn't make me sympathetic enough to the protagonist to really care one way or another how things turn out. Save the price of the DVD and go buy some of the comics, I am sure it will be a better experience."
tt1375666,"Regardless of my definitive opinion, this is a 'sensational' film and a mind-bending one like I've never seen before. And guess what ? I think I was victim of its own concept since I went through four stages of reviews with ""Inception"", one within another (naturally) :REVIEW 1 : Ecstasy in Perception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""This is not a film, This is an experience ... a cinematic ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" ... This is why I love movies ... why imagination is the greatest human gift ... why I dream to write such creative and intelligent stories ... And still ... I don't know how to feel ...

I need to watch it again ... this is not a movie to watch once ... definitely ... it's so disturbing it's great, so great it's disturbing ..."" 10/10This is the raw feeling, authentic? sincere? naive? well it was the immediate one, one that couldn't be altered by other viewer's opinions, praises or criticisms. This is how I felt when the movie ended. A second watching transported me from ecstasy in perception to ...REVIEW 2 : Originality in Conception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""It's a dazzling intelligence-challenging puzzle, but only on an intellectual level, not emotional. Why not? Should all the movies have a 'heart' beating inside ... as long as it makes yours do. Now I understand the film and love it because I decided not to care for the emotion and just try to understand the story. And with this mindset, believe me, ""Inception"" is an incredible experience. The movie is a fantasy and remains realistic in the same time, it's real because we know it's fake, but the fake world feels so real because we can technically live in. It doesn't say anything about dreams and subconsciousness, because it's all about actual and virtual reality, perceptions and intentions. As a script, it's a very impressive work from Christopher Nolan, not to mention the brilliant editing. Yes, I know I'm watching a film, but this one I value as an intricate puzzle that challenges my intelligence. ""Inception"" is like a cinematic Rubik's cube."" 9,5/10I was still loving the film, but in the meantime, starting to concede that the enjoyment was more on a technical level, on the construction of the plot and the intricacy of the script ... I admitted that the whole Mal-Cobb subplot was just plot devices to insert a melodrama, necessary to plunge us in Cobb's subconscious and inject it into Fisher's dreams, combining this way two parallel worlds, two narrative structures. In such action-driven films, 'forced' is 'flat' and melodrama must be handled carefully. The movie was perceived as excellent by my humble mind, but more in a cinematographic, geometric, almost pragmatic way ... which brings me to ...REVIEW 3 : Enthusiasm in Reception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""It's a great film that should grab the Oscars for Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Visual Effects, Sound Effects, Best Cinematography. If it didn't, there would be no justice!"" 8/10I knew I enjoyed the movie because as I mentioned before, it featured great thrills, action, script, music, editing, visuals ... hence the word 'sensational' I used in the beginning of this review. But as I titled in another review : ""many elements of greatness don't necessarily make a great film"". I started to question myself. It's a film about dreams, about subconscious, right? but did I sense a real escapism in those supposedly dreamy settings? didn't those dreams look a little bit like micro-episodes from formulaic action films? could the fights (or anything for that matter) be more imaginative? did the Mal-Cobb subplot make me feel sympathy for any of them? did I really care for Cobb? or did Leo make me care for his character? did I care for the whole mission? did any of the characters appeal to me? So many interrogation marks leading me to the ""Limbo"" review ...REVIEW 4 : Realism in Deception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""Wow ... this movie has a really strange power, it leaves me ecstatic when it finishes, and then the more I think about it, the more I realize that the very aspect that made me love the film could've been handled in a better way and with a deeper characterization: less chase scenes and shootings, more imagination and by that, I mean more beautiful settings and creative plot devices ... This movie is a cinematic experience that makes you scratch your head and hold your breath, but does it deserve all the praise? I wonder how I fell for this one, but I think it's time to retract myself and admit my judgment mistake. Yes, the movie is a cinematic Rubik's cube, but I guess I forgot how I used to get quickly bored by this game. How did I change my mind ? ... I don't know ... thinking, reading, realizing, sharing views, using this mind ""Inception"" tried to twist ... A very creative film, I wish it will win all the Oscars previously mentioned, but beyond the creativity of the concept ... what did I enjoy? I guess only the concept, the rest was just ... all flash and no substance"" 6/10Yep, the rating also fell through 4 ""layers"" ... what a painful awakening, this movie amazed me so much, I couldn't feel anything negative about it ... and one thing for sure, ""Inception"" has the weirdest power of attraction when you watch it for the first time, that's why I understand its popularity. It's like my mind had already accepted the idea that the movie would be a masterpiece just because it relied on a particularly innovative concept. Or was I just victim of an ""Inception"" called Marketing?"
tt0848228,"I went into this movie with high expectations. I avoided reviews and went in unspoiled. I am a fan of the Iron Man movies, but I didn't see the newest Hulk movie, Thor or Captain America. This movie seemed to be lacking in character development and back story that make movies like the first Iron Man, X-men and The Dark Knight exceptional. It felt like I should have done my homework before seeing this one. This movie had a lot of action, but I never felt connected to the characters I hadn't seen before - Captain America, Thor, the Scarlett Johanssen character and the Jeremy Renner character. The Hulk was very inconsistent as well. In some parts of the movie he was uncontrollable, and in other parts he was a team player. And how did Hawk Eye take so long run out of arrows??? My idea of a ""great"" movie is that you get to know the characters through the movie itself. I shouldn't be expected to watch four or five other movies to get it. I enjoyed it, just not as much as I would have expected. Both my wife and I needed to get to the credits see get the character names of Black Widow and Hawk Eye. I'll go back and watch those other movies and maybe I'll appreciate it more."
tt1345836,"I was looking forward to this. Unfortunately, my two buddies and I left the theatre quite disappointed. The plot was weak and full of holes and often as unintelligible as the villain. I appreciate that the actor was supposed to be speaking through a mask, but one really has to strain to hear what he was saying. It was too long, by at least 30 minutes.The conclusion and wrap up were lazy. I felt like I was being treated like an idiot fan-boy. The special effects and cinematography were superlative. Granted. But one has to assume that will be on the screen for a bloated blockbuster like this. We, the audience, deserve better and we deserve more. Batman deserves better!Ultimately, it's just another stupid movie, but some folks get so caught up in this fluff - a movie very few will care or be talking about six months from now. That's my opinion. And I'm not alone."

tt1375666,"As long as it remains possible to spend 100 million dollars on making drivel, setting aside 10 million towards advertising in order to tell people that it's great so that they've spent 200 million on tickets before they find out otherwise, there'll be no incentive for Hollywood movie-making ever to improve.I've reviewed Angelina Jolie's latest farrago in very similar terms. While that movie bizarrely assumes that the Cold War still remains of interest to anyone (?), ""Inception"" insists basically that it's interesting to watch other people's dreams. Well, visually it can be - the ""architecture-bending"" style of ""Inception"" would have had great appeal, maybe in a 60-second advert for a credit card or mobile phone company.But visual appeal aside, the ""plot"" of the movie is not so much multi-layered as multi- pointless. The old clich√© that ""if you die in dream you wake up"" is hauled out here with monotonous regularity, but it's never applied consistently, and even if it were, who cares? If you MUST fire a machine gun at someone in a dream (and I can't think of any reason why you'd really need to), why would you ever run out of bullets? Wouldn't you just dream up some more? If you want to blow up a dream hotel, do you really NEED dream explosives? If the fuse goes out, is it safe to return, or should you always light the dreamy blue touchpaper and stand well back?The movie's makers assume that multi-layering these various dream levels will be endlessly fascinating (as evidenced by the enormous running time), but anyone with an ounce of discernment will simply become less and less connected as the plot becomes ""deeper"".We're in the same childish, ill-conceived territory here as many movies about existing in ""virtual reality"" or even ""on the holodeck"". Simulate as convincingly as you like, but you can't change the laws of physics in the real world, and if you're in a dream, then there's no real need to worry about being stabbed or shot, and neither should the viewer care whether the characters are, or aren't.The urban myth being put about that ""Inception"" includes some sort of interesting or unexpected ending is no more than that.For a witty, snappy meditation on alternative reality, try Cronenberg's ""eXistenZ"", and (despite the fact that, like, when you're dreaming you know, your life goes really slowly and, like, you can live a whole lifetime in the dreamy dream state, man) try to give this bloated waste of time a miss."
tt1345836,"I consider myself a huge fan of comic book movies. They're basically character studies with huge budgets and great special effects. I have to admit I'm not the hugest fan of Nolan's trilogy. For a movie that's supposed to be so serious and realistic the movies stop to have really dumb unrealistic moments for the sake of being ""epic"". Not to mention whenever Nolan writes dialogue for the mystique or mythos of Batman it's ALWAYS corny. He writes such great dialogue for his villains but anytime he tries to write for Batman or people talking about the idea of Batman it gets super cheesy *SPOILERS*****. The result we have here is basically Nolan sleepwalking through the movie with poor dialogue, plot inconsistencies, character motivations that aren't clear, poor fight choreography, and probably the worst ending I've ever seen in a superhero movie or a Nolan film in general.To get the good out of the way.... Ummm I honestly have nothing good to say about this movie. All the pieces are here to make a great movie. I can see why people love this movie, because it's basically a copy of The Dark Knight. Everything good gets undercut by the end of the movie. Tom Hardy as Bane turns in a great menacing performance that is worthy being held up to next to the Joker. He almost saves the film just like Heath Ledger did with the first sequel except towards the end of the movie he is totally underused and undercut. But all of his scenes where good or at least set up well. There's also two cameos that where great and really pumped me up for the rest of the movie that I won't spoil. I could say the movies greatest strength and crutch is that it ties so well into the first movie, but that also slows the movie down and makes it trip over it's own feet several times. The Score is solid if a little repetitive and the movie looks great at points.Now to the bad. This movie is so slow. I'm not going to say boring because that's subjective, but even people who loved the movie can attest to the fact that this movie's pacing is a big problem. What's more is the story pacing which takes it's time inching along until the final act which just breezes by important details leaving anyone besides the core fan base cold and unsatisfied. The editing is horrific and I don't know if I can blame the editor or Nolan's top heavy script which just like the last movie brings in the overly complicated story. The problem with such a convoluted narrative is that in order to get people to know what's going on the audience gets their hand held through scenes as actors have to constantly repeat what we're supposed to take away from the scene, which makes the movie predictable. I knew the ending to every single scene either from knowing the way it mirrored a scene earlier in the trilogy or just the way it's telegraphed. The acting isn't very good either aside from Bane who ironically gets more expressiveness out of his face when it's mostly covered up. All these actors are normally great but they're literally given only one expression. All the characters are one note throughout the whole movie there is no real character progression. The ending is stupid in so many ways i won't get into and this is just an unpleasant experience for anyone who isn't already loving the movie walking in.Now to hit some personal points I think Nolan is a good director who gets a lot of credit for using a very specific bag of tricks and makes crowd pleaser's that function as thought provoking movies. Much like Tarantino once you see the formula a lot of the magic is gone. Nolan is no David Fincher or Sam Mendes. He doesn't have the teeth to end a movie in a dark way everything always works out in the end and it's frustrating. *****SPOILERS***** The last act is probably more boring because there's no sense of tension. I knew from the beginning no main characters where going to die because Nolan is so soft. If I had to give the last harry potter movies credit they killed off a lot of the main cast so there was a genuine sense of not knowing whose going to make it. Another problem is that this is the most indulgent movie I've seen this year. There is no reason this movie needed to be so long. It pretends to be some great thoughtful movie, but it's not. There are so many themes in this movie that are too obvious or don't come into play into the movies ending. Not to mention the themes in this movie heavily contradict the ones in the previous movies. This is a really dumb movie pretending to be a smart thoughtful one. There are so many moments that are exaggerated to a ridiculous level to be ""epic"" that made me roll my eyes, this is on a Spiderman 3 level of trilogy ending.I'm giving this 4 stars because the average movie audience isn't going to care about story structure and not look as deep into it as some cinephiles may. It's a very polarizing movie, but it's really insulting at times and the more I think about it the more I dislike it. I'm really worried that superman might be 3 hours long now."
tt7286456,"Absolute disappointment. I believed the hype like a fool. No person that actually saw it told me it was a good movie, just the stupid reviews. It's so cringe, with nothing actually happening except Phoenix smoking and dancing around. There is no action, no substance, no humor. Everything is so cringe and overacted.
I suppose if you like those independent movies at TIFF or Cannes this is something for you. If you actually wanna be entertained and see The Joker from the DC, this is not it.
Best description is millennial joker. Society is mean to him, nobody gives him anything so he cries and complains about it to get attention. When none is given, he starts killing."
tt0133093,"Anyone with half of a brain could see right through this mainstream Hollywood garbage.The effects are not ""spectacular"" (they are loud, annoying, and overblown) the acting isn't ""great"" (It sucks).It's kind of like Bill & Ted's Adventures Through an Alternate Reality.Most of the ""serious dramatic scenes"" were laughable.  I am outraged that this is number 38 on the all-time 250!!!  It should be in the bottom 100.It's talk, talk, talk, with something remotely resembling an action sequence popping up on the screen every 30 minutes.  It looks like a crazed computer ate up a roll of film and spat it back out.You are WAY, WAY, WAY better off watching the GREAT movies like Citizen Kane or City Lights or Superman: The Movie!!I give it a 0 out of 10, it's a BOMB!!!But, I'm sure the over-crazed Matrix fans will have some lame excuses for all the movie's shortcomings."
tt0120737,"When I bought this movie I thought it was going to be a grand epic adventure. Although it was that, it failed to keep my attention. I have a very good attention span and never fall asleep during movies but I just couldn't sit still during this movie. The story was good and the directing was good but it lacked action. Not fighting action but I mean as in stuff happens because nothing really happens. Its very corny ""You shall not pass!""so corny. Reminds me of a Dungeons and Dragons meet or something. Although the last movie in the series is good,this certainly isn't; I had a tough time falling asleep once so I decided to watch this movie and that became my replacement for warm milk. Great for fans but for anyone else this will fail to catch your interest."
tt0167260,"Don't get me wrong, these movies are very well made. It's amazing that these books were actually made into films in the first place. It takes a lot of vision to accomplish that. However, as a film or even a trilogy, there are several fallbacks. Firstly, there is a lot of unneeded dialogue. Secondly, after the audience waits for the climax and then the rundown at the end of the film, the movie doesn't end. It feels it needs to tie up loose ends that most audience members won't see, such as what happens to Bilbo. All in all, the vision deserved the Academy Award, although as always, there is room for improvement."
tt0120815,"The action scenes in this film are superb - gritty, realistic and plain nasty. However, it remains a source of irritation that such good film making is washed down with an unhealthy dose of flag-waving patriotism. What is the message of this film? That occasionally you find SOMETHING worth fighting and dying for or that it's glorious to die for your country (read Owen for further comments on this)Something else it has led to is a number of American reviewers giving the ""We died to save your a$$es"" speach. This itself is both stupid and untrue - the people who wrote those messages did nothing. America got involved only when it was directly threatened by the Nazis, and not before.I am glad, however, that such views are in a minority from the American postings - It's a pity that the many are tarred by the few.Millions of normal Europeans died in this war - from bombings, shootings, torture, starvation, disease and the Holocaust. This film made only a token attempt to reference this - nothing more.The thin red line was a much better, less commercial film with that very neccessary ingredient - a message - this one remains a catalogue of missed opportunities and a formulaic start and end."
tt0120737,"THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING / (2001) ** (out of four)By Blake French:(WARNING: Minor spoilers ahead.)The only thing worse than a bad movie is a bad movie that thinks it is good. The only thing worse than a bad movie that thinks it is good is a three hour long bad movie that thinks it is good.Case in point: ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" based on the towering trilogy of novels by J.R.R Tolkien. According to this film's production notes, this is one of the most colossal movie productions ever embarked upon, based on one of the most famous trilogies ever written. And you though ""Harry Potter"" had big expectationsOne of the biggest movie productions ever embarked upon? That's certainly a big statement-but I believe every word. It has taken four decades for cinema technology to reach the level of sophistication to bring this story to life. Everything about the film is B-I-G. It took over one-hundred million dollars to bring the vision to life, and this is only the first installment of three. Even the film's production notes-that embody 20 pages of single-spaced, Times New Roman, 12 point font-are of the longest I have seen. Peter Jackson, the film's director, has vowed to make three motion pictures simultaneously to capture Tolkien's lengthy epic in its entirety.LOTR thinks it is hot stuff, too. With amazing special effects, astonishing makeup, impressive costumes, dazzling sets, and a production crew big enough to occupy every hotel room in Chicago, it would be easy to let all the glamour get to your head.Case in point: The film took home a whole pile of Golden Globe nominations. It's currently ranked as the best movie of all time on the Internet Movie Database. It will surely break box office records, setting a new standard for film adaptations.Sure, the film's technical aspects are vastly elaborate, the characters well cast, and the special effects amazing. So, what else do you expect from a big budget extravaganza like this? How about a story that does not find itself distracted with every step? Or characters that are not puppets of the plot? Is it really too much to ask for a movie to obey the guidelines it sets for itself.I guess so. The screenplay, by Jackson, Frances Walsh, and Philippa Boyens, seems to calculate every move out of a strict book of rules. Unfortunately, this book is like the English language-it appears to have an exception for every single rule. In this movie, anything can happen at anytime-as long as it doesn't interfere with the plot. This makes it quite difficult to take the movie seriously.In this part of the trilogy, a shy young hobbit named Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) inherits a ring-but it's no ordinary ring. It is really an instrument of absolute power that could allow a grumpy old wizard to rule the planet. Frodo and a loyal fellowship of hobbits, men, a wizard, a dwarf, and an elf vow to take a journey to destroy the ring. To rid the world of this treacherous jewelry, they must travel across Middle-Earth to the place where it first was first created.Of course, the entire course of future history is entwined with the fate of the fellowship.Actually, it's quite humorous of what this movie makes us buy. There is an old wizard man who escapes a towering prison by summoning an enormous bird to rescue him-at the last minute, of course. Where is this great and powerful bird when the character later falls to his doom in a deep, treacherous cave?Then there's the old evil wizard. The movie makes it obvious that this being possesses mighty powers. Powers so great he can throw a full-sized person across a large room using only his thoughts. He can even make a bolt of lightning strike a snow-covered mountain, creating a destructive avalanche. LOTR convinces us this character can do just about anything. So why doesn't this diabolical warlock just rid himself of the Fellowship of the Ring? Strike them dead with a lightning bolt? Crush them with a big rock? I will tell you why, because that would be too simple-after all, we need a three hour movie out of this installment alone.""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" plays like the big fat novel it is based on. We can almost see the page turning. The chapters arriving. There are many moments of silence, where the character's process what seems like pages of thoughts. The dialogue often sounds like written English. We listen to tons of mumbo jumbo about spirits, magic, power, evil, good, and, of course, rings.Much of it is hard to buy, even if you suspend disbelief. One scene actually inspires giggles. Two old cripples take part in a vicious supernatural battle, where their bodies fly across rooms, slamming into walls and hard, pointy objects. A simple punch should knock such a person out permanently-but these are wizards, or, more importantly, characters in this movie. Death is only real when the screenplay requires it to be. During another battle between a big, fiery monster, all of a sudden, it is possible for the old man to die.It's difficult to review a movie when it is only the first installment of a three-part series, and it's even more difficult when you have no previous knowledge about the book or the outcome of the story. Perhaps, years down the road, after I watch the rest of the installments, I will look back and understand this movieBut I doubt it. LOTR bored me to death. The best way to tell if a book adaptation really works it to ask if the movie makes you want to read the material it is based on. Before watching LOTR, I was inspired by the great hype, and considered read Tolkien's towering novels. After watching this movie, I would not read any of the author's books if they were the last novels on the face of the planet. I fear the next two productions in this dreadful series. We can only hope they're not three hours long!"

tt0068646,"After hearing about this legendary film I decided it was about time I watched it....after about an hour I really wished I hadn't wasted the money renting it...after the movie finished I was bored.  The film was nothing like I had expected and I don't know how it possibly made it as big as it has.  It was quite well cast I love Diane Keaton but she's better in Woody Allen's comedy's than in this derivitive movie.  You want a good gangster movie...watch Goodfella's...it actually has a good story, entertaining characters & violence and paints a much more realistic picture of the mob world of the era.  I'm not even going to bother watching parts 2 or 3 of the godfather coz Marlon Brando ain't even in them so their ain't much point! I think I'll go watch Marlon Brando's greatest performance...Guy's N Doll's."
tt0120815,"There is violence and there is violence. With so many personal reviews of this movie, it's hard for me to add anything. The first half hour affected me like no other in recent years. When the boys vomited on the amphibian, I wondered if they were seasick or scared to death. When the expression ""cannon fodder"" is casually used, do we understand that this means that the second wave is making its way to the shore over the dead and dying bodies of the first wave, like ants sacrificing themselves to get over a puddle. Those who break through, break through, because there are only so many bullets and so many people. They are naked, disoriented, helpless - they have nowhere to go but forward. I will always be haunted by the memory of the soldier who searched and then found his dismembered hand in the midst of the carnage. I will remember those who tried to get to the surface of the water, but were hit underwater. If someone has a heart, his attitude towards war should never be the same. How we, who have never been there, can imagine what it was like. Like ""Schindler's List"" about the Holocaust, this film should be an educational film about the war."
tt0372784,"The movie was completely unrewarding. Some of the plot elements had potential to be interesting, and the concept of the movie was great. Unfortunately, after watching it, I came away completely unsatisfied, because there was nothing more to think about. Everything was portrayed on a 3rd grade level, and nothing was really left to the imagination. where is the dualism of good and evil? Where is the delicate line between vigilante and hero? This movie attempts to draw these lines and then clearly plant itself in the good/hero camp. Yawn. What's the point?I am surprised that this movie is doing so well on IMDb, and hope that people will wake up soon and realize this movie is just another boring action flick. Some say its an improvement from Batman and Robin, notably the worst of the Batman movies. But for what Batman Begins makes up for in plot complexity and special effects, it loses by insulting my intelligence and trying to make everything in the Batman world so black and white."
tt0108052,"Schindler's list is not a bad film per se - Liam Neeson is very good as Schindler and if you edit out some of the more overblown scenes - the story is still riveting. Yet it could have been so much more if the story just told simply and if the central theme were fully understood and developed.Before the war Schindler and his friend, Goeth were boozy, flirtatious German businessmen. Both would have likely been uninspired failures had there been no war. In a kinder world, Goeth's and Schindler's moral differences might have manifested themselves in the size of the tip that they would leave the barmaid. In war, the consequences of moral choices are greatly magnified, resulting in Schindler becoming a most unlikely heroic figure, and Goeth becoming a loathed prison commandant. In the film, Spielberg elevates Schindler to sainthood status and portrays Goeth as a sadistic psychopath. By sanitizing Schindler's many faults (boozing, gambling, womanizing...) and by demonizing Goeth, Spielberg severs our connection with them and, ironically, blunts the conflict between them. Adolf Eichmann was far more chilling than Charles Manson. Unlike Manson, whom we could dismiss as psychotic, Eichmann was the faceless functionary that we have all experienced, whose defense of ""following orders"" is one that we have all heard, a defense that was used by many during the war, and one that we might see ourselves using under similar circumstances had we not Schindler's courage. By making Schindler a saint, Spielberg diminishes both his accomplishment and his inspiration to us - saints have no problems making the right decision - the rest of us do. Rather than a gaping chasm, there is but a fine moral line between Schindler and Goeth - one that we tread every day, which fortunately for us, rarely does more than determines a barmaid's salary.Spielberg does not develop this simple theme, preferring to impress us with a grandiose view of a great moral tale. Instead, he comes off as the underskilled sous-chef drowning a wonderful filet mignon in an overly rich sauce. The quality of the ingredients still shine through despite the clumsy handling but does not approach its great potential. In the end, the best thing about the film is that it reminds Americans of a monstrous event in history. It is unfortunate that this reminder is necessary and that it reduces such a timeless parable to a useful public service announcement."
tt0372784,"I would say I did like the movie in general, enjoyed it. What really impressed me thought, was actually the script. I though the script was really well written. Nolan keeps me interested and focused on the movie. Christian Bale was good, but he was too angry and cold, I believe he is a better actor than that. I absolutely loved Morgan Freeman, I think that man never fails.The idea of how justice is subjective, was very intriguing. For some reason I was drawn to the idea of destroying a place that was so overwhelmed with corruption to rebuild it. Even though its too dramatic it felt too real to me as well. It reminded me with Emperor Nero's burning of Rome to rebuild the city.I loved how the movie wasn't just about some action moves, but had many life teaching lessons, especially the first part, before he heads back to Gotham City. The first part of the movie was probably my favorite part. There were lots of good scenes and even more good quotes.I loved that little hint of the joker at the end, though I miss him through out the movie.I was chatting with a friend who said, for some reason he doesn't remember the movie that much, maybe the editing wasn't that good. I think it was OK not very impressive. Visual effects were really good though part of why the movie was quite interesting.Unfortunately Nolan always bore me right before the end of the movie, at some point the action is just taking way too much time and I wan to get to the end of things. Also the soundtracks were good, served the movie well, but didn't feel memorable to me. For me the best one was the movie beginning one, Vespertilio by Hans Zimmer (all soundtracks were of his composition)Overall it is an enjoyable movie, not one of the best I have seen though. Not very sure if it should be on the top250 list.its-lalas-land.blogspot.com"
tt0167261,"As I already said in the review for THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING I was curious for years about the LOTR trilogy because of their reputation and the many reviews for them here. I finally saw them last summer and I loved them all, yet this (the second) didn't win me over like the others. I don't say it's bad, just not on the same level of the previous or THE RETURN OF THE KING.Needless to say that this chapter follows three stories: Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Samwise (Sean Astin) continue their journey towards Mordor for destroying the only ring with the company of its original owner Gollum; Aragorn, Legolas and Ghimli (Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys Davies) and then Gandalf (Ian McKellen) go to rescue Rohan that is ready for the battle against Saruman (Christopher Lee); and Merry and Peregrine (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) plan an attack on Isengard while in the custody of Treebeard.The sets are great, and you can see that they spent all their money for having them so big. The soundtrack is nice, no surprise here. The performances were good, nothing to rave about, and Gollum was very funny despite a bit scary (and I won't recommend this movie to very young or sensible viewers for this reason alone). The problems were that the pace was slow in the second half and made the performances stilted, and the battle scene with those ancient elephants seemed a bit too long for my taste.Still, not the greatest in the trilogy but I think the director did it on purpose for making us wait what was in store for the third chapter."
tt0816692,"Though I am not a Bat-person, and do not wish to become one, I have admired Christopher Nolan for his early films and 'Inception', though, with the exception of 'Insomnia', I always regarded them as, in the immortal words of Andrew Sarris 'less than meets the eye'. I do not like to call films pretentious, but with 'Memento' and 'Inception' the word certainly came to mind. They seemed shallow pretending to be deep.The same is, in my opinion, certainly true of 'Interstellar'. Yes, it carries you along for a ride, and yes the special effects are great, and yes, it might give us pause to think what will, in fact, be the destiny of our species. But, my dear Mr Nolan, surely you must realise that our species will not survive by planting American flags on distant planets. And, like 'Gravity' before it, the search for a happy ending has totally destroyed any shred of credibility of what might have gone before. The image of Cooper floating around Saturn without his spaceship, waiting to be picked up by a passing probe (just before his oxygen runs out, of course) is so ridiculous that if Stanley Kubrick were to be told that it is a respectful reference to the 'starchild' at the end of '2001', he'd punch you in the nose.'Interstellar' - for all of its attempts to incorporate relativistic time dilation and very clever (I do not use that word in a derogatory sense) visual representation of multi-dimensional string theory towards the end, is void of any real cultural insight.The film simply extends 'The Wizard of Oz' into the space age and decides at the end that there is really somewhere better than home. It is TOSH! Great films tell us something memorable about the human condition, or the nature of cinema itself. This film, for all its quotes from Dylan Thomas does neither. It is for people who think that the word 'awesome' has some profound meaning and not, as is the case, an excuse for not finding a more appropriate and restrained reaction.Any suggestion that it deserves a Best Picture Oscar is a sad comment on the way that those awards have become debased in recent years."
tt1375666,"Ten years ago, Christopher Nolan wrote and directed the brilliant 'Momento', a stunning thriller that pushed the boundaries of storytelling convention. It was great, but still, one couldn't help wondering, where would Nolan go from here? How could he trump this achievement? In fact, although his subsequent films have been praised, they've been less distinctive, but with 'Inception', he returns to his adventurous roots, producing a story that is even more audacious than 'Momento'; and unfortunately, the result is dreadful. And worse than the fact that it doesn't really work is the fact that while it is distinctive, it is distinctive in a very conventional way. Since his early success, Nolan has taken work from big studios, and 'Inception' is no exception; and the result is a Hollywood movie straining desperately to stand out, instead of something more truly independent. in spirit.To make the point in more detail, 'Inception' features a starry cast (I'm, afraid for me, the casting of Leonardo diCaprio has become a clear sign of a poor film with pretensions); an implausibly attractive geeky female assistant; loads of expository dialogue (at one point, it is explained that someone is the most powerful media baron in the world ‚Äì i.e. they appear to be so powerful that no-one had heard of them); fast pace and Jason Bourne style camera work; sub-'Matrix' style ideas about the nature of reality, superficially intriguing and certainly confusing, but of little philosophical depth; extraordinary special effects; and above all else, a plot comprising an incoherent sequence of random set-piece scenes that seems constructed to showcase said special effects rather than because it makes sense as a story. It may sound like an intriguing idea to have the cast simultaneously fighting for their lives in seven different nested dream-spaces, but in fact, it isn't; multiplying the threat to the heroes only reduces the dramatic impact of each one.To give Nolan credit, he has made a wholly cinematic film; you certainly couldn't imagine this in book form. Sadly it's very hard to imagine it as a screenplay either, or as any sort of story. And it was story, not special effects, that made 'Momento' great; and while that story was highly unusual, it made internal sense. But less is never more in Hollywood; and sadly, more is often just a mess."
tt0361748,"This movie is totally bullshit. I was disappointed. especially the end of the movie is very nonsense. How come it became the number 70 with oven 135 K votes, I don't understand. I would prefer a low budget comedy movie instead. But the usual Tarantino violent scenes were successful bu not enough. I really wonder what the point of this movie would be if the members of the ""Basterds"" were not Jew. It is obvious that most of the voters are citizens of the USA and they like to see the USA in the first place all the time and because the directors know this and they want to earn more money they use similar items with similar subjects. No thanks to Tarantino for this ordinary movie."
tt0111161,"WEll I had high hopes for this movie.  But it fell way short.  I was hoping it would keep me guessing, but this movie was easy to predict what was going to happen.  Though I did think the acting was good by both main stars.Jason"
tt0102926,"I had read this book by Thomas Harris and thought it would make a great movie but was concerned when I heard that Jonathan Demme was making it. How wrong I was though and I was overwhelmingly surprised. It was the first film about a serial killer where it did not rely on strong elements of violence and gore but simply left it to the imagination. Obviously Hopkins and Foster get all the plaudits and rightly so but this is one of the only films that has so many superb minor characters such as Barney, Ardelia Mapp and Bill himself. I urge those who like this movie to watch the making of documentary as it is truly fascinating. A roller-coaster ride of emotions and tension which I enjoy every time I watch it."
tt0133093,"Years ago, when I was in grade 10, we watched this in ethics class. My teacher Mrs. Kosiol proudly announced that she had interpreted how the Matrix was inspired by Plato's cave allegory before the maker of this movie mentioned it.I just rewatched it mostly because I don't remember everything in the movie and want to watch its sequels. The first half of the movie really had me. All these ideas must have been so revolutionary for 1999 and surely defined parts of film-making. Some ideas like AIs and humans destroying the planet seem overused nowadays but for 1999 this is a remarkable movie.I really like the matrix idea. As my teacher said, it really is like Plato's allegory and it's interesting and scary to think about what were if the matrix was actually true. The idea also reminded me of the Infinite Tsukuyomi from Naruto. I wonder if Kishimoto was inspired by the matrix.So the first half really had me and I kinda wanted to like this movie but so many points just destroyed the feel for me. Especially the second half was pretty boring and absurd.With such an intriguing idea as the matrix, why does there have to be all those fight scenes? Why does there have to be hand-to-hand combat and gunshots and what-not? Maybe that generates more viewership in the cinema but for me it really didn't fit the scene.And then the very ending, like what was that? Why does Trinity have to wait so long and tell Neo something almost meaningless in front of the phone booth? For god sake, just get out and then you have all the time in the world to say whatever you want.It was all to set up some romance between Neo and Trinity. But I ask you: Why?! This was so forced and at no point of the movie it seemed like there would be a romantic relationship arising between them. It was romance just for the sake of a Hollywood kiss.And then there is Neo. How flat can a character be? This guy has absolutely no personality besides being the one. And him going back in to save Morpheus also just doesn't fit his personality, it is a forced superhero behaviour. Then, at the end he just randomly becomes overpowered for no reason at all. Oh, I guess there is a reason - the power of love. How clich√©.He starts flexing and fighting one-handed but man just get the **** out of the matrix. We don't even know what these people see in Neo. Why was he chosen? His hacker personality seems to have almost no impact at all. Neo is really one of the worst written characters I've seen recently.It's a revolutionary movie that you should have seen to experience the idea of the matrix. But other than these ideas, it is not too watch-worthy."
tt0372784,"Let's make it short, the story is OK, but the casting... Bruce's parents are very rich people. They are going to see an posh opera, but when they leave, the outside is very dodgy, it's like a no man's land. This doesn't make any sense, this area could have been better. Why changing Bruce's voice when he's holding his bat mask. Keanu Reeves could have play it better ( see the dumbest movie of the year: Matrix II and III). Apart from that, I found it very boring but with some nice effects: especially when Bruce appears, speaks his 3 words and then disappears. How can a good director like Mr Nolan ask talented actors playing like this."
tt0137523,"Beyond anything I'm about to say, I just don't understand how people can call Fight Club entertaining. I was so bored I had to give myself excuses to turn it off and do something else. It just kept going and going, and 90% of the screen time has nothing to do with anything. The humor was so juvenile and clich√©, I can't say I laughed once¬óI heard the entire script back in 3rd grade at recess. So, really, as far as entertainment value goes, I can't see anything redeeming. Every 10 minutes I kept asking myself why I was even watching it, because nothing was happening, and in the end nothing did happen. There was no story, just some pretentious social commentary that was nothing new.Being a man, I've heard the clich√© ""We're men raised by women!"" so many times I can't even take it seriously anymore. That clich√© has existed since then 60's, as far as my knowledge, if not earlier than that. Now this takes that clich√© and forms a movie around it. For one, everyone who is calling this ""daring"" or ""original"" needs to understand something: it takes no more balls the take a clich√© and build a movie around it than it does to remake something.The intellectuals on there had argued both ways about the validity of ""We're men raised by women!"", so I'm not going to. Go read their reviews and find your open opinion on the matter. However, something no one here has said is that Fight Club is exactly that: an opinion. I could make a movie about a group of men who realize that they prefer being like women, then backlash and say EVERY man HAS to feel this way. Why? Because . . . well, because the fictional characters in the movie said so. That's because! Fight Club is an opinion, not an absolute truth. If you were to take real men and put them in a fight club such as this one, I can guarantee a lot of them would NOT feel alive¬óbut the film is too immature to admit that it a possibility. Likewise, if you were to start a fight club for women, I can guarantee that a lot of them would feel just as alive as men¬óonce again, the film doesn't admit that is a possibility. Fight Club is so self-absorbed in a shallow clich√© that it denies all flaws it could have, and that is the main flaw with the social commentary. If Fight Club was truly ballsy and original itself, which it's not, the story would at least admit that it is an opinion and not absolute truth, as it claims. And, really, the fact alone that people would base their full opinions on something fictional is ridicules and shallow in itself. Fiction is fiction. Yes, fiction can be a tool to understanding reality, but it still can be manipulated to understand whatever reality it wants to understand¬óincluding false reality. Basing an entire view on something based on something fictional, as this movie is, is just pathetic.Okay, now with that out of the way, I want to talk about the horrid storytelling this movie had. If Fight Club actually knew how to tell a story, I might have given it a much higher score. The entire movie is insanely boring, but the first hour and a half is pretty well-done, if you ignore the fact you've heard every bit of humor on the playground and that David Fincher has laughably poor arguing skills. After the car crash scene, however, the entire movie descends into poorly directed chaos. There are so many bloated, pointless scenes from this point until the end I was literally counting down the minutes until it was over. All the quirks that made the characters interesting fall away and leave them cardboard-thin. If the storytelling was done effectively, the chaos would have led into an intense, direct climax/finale. Instead, the ending is bloated with sub-plot after sub-plot that amount to nothing in the end, getting rid of any and all intensity that could have been created, and just leaving me bored and laughing at things that weren't supposed to be funny. The decent fight club plot twists into a cheesy wannabe Die Hard plot and at that point I lost all ability to take the movie seriously. I can understand it was trying to add another layer to the overdone social commentary, but it didn't work. The ending should have been cut by at least 40 minutes to be even close to effective. Poor, cheesy storytelling.In the end, I can understand why people would think this movie is brilliant. On the other hand, I can't understand anyone out of junior high who shouldn't see the gaping flaws in the social commentary. But maybe I'm looking at this entire review the wrong way. Maybe I'm trying to find flaws with the story, when it had no story to start with. This just a poor excuse to preach clich√©s you've heard all your life, not to entertain. It's an English opinion paper, nothing more, nothing less. If so, it gets an F for being pretensions, close-minded, and just downright boring.5/10"

tt1853728,"I know there is a law against talking about internal logic with regard to QT-movies. But I'm quite a bit fed up with sloppy, dyslexic screen writing and I'm feeling kind of outlawish, so here I go: Initially Schultz (Christoph Waltz) asks for Django's help, because Django is an acquaintance of three fugitives, the bounty hunter Schultz is after. A ""Dead or Alive""-handbill with its sketchy description and drawing is not very reliable and shooting the wrong guy can easily happen and it will just as easily get yourself hanged. Therefore the recruiting of Django does make perfect sense. Looking for another wanted man Schultz enters the next town, where he's never been, meets him, who is now the sheriff of this town and whom he's never seen, and kills him after a few seconds, without even talking to him. This is the moment ""Django Unchained"" stops making sense.Schultz is a cold blooded serial killer who murders people because some sheet of paper tells him that he's got the right to do so. He is a hypocrite, he gets mad at someone who also executes his state approved right to kill, but with sadistic pleasure. Murder is fine as long as the state tells you so and you do it for business, not for fun. In the original Spaghetti Western a guy like that would have always been the villain, many of the heroes were ""Wanted Men"" themselves. In ""Django Unchained"" he is the only human and sympathetic figure and without any doubt the main character. In many ways the spirit of ""Django Unchained"" is the exact opposite of that found in the movies Tarantino tried to emulate.The story of the bland eponymous Django's development from slave in chains and rags to sharp dressed gunslinger with sunglasses is above all ridiculous and boring. So after Schultz's exit this excessively overlong movie becomes even more of an ordeal, although you get to see the explosion of a queer, ugly old geezer, who really deserved to die. He is played by QT himself and that's only something to look forward to and no spoiler, because naturally it has little plot relevance.""Django Unchained"" is about hating a whole ethnic group, just like ""Inglourious Basterds"", where Tarantino made sure to avoid the impression that there could be a German (a ""Nazi"") who wasn't devilishly evil. The nice young Zoller turns out to be a wannabe rapist and the clever detective Landa (Waltz) turns into a monster, strangling a helpless woman to death. After all Tarantino wanted his viewers to enjoy the butchering of hundreds of Germans in a cinema hall. In ""Django Unchained"" the murderous Schultz is the only decent white guy. All the others are preoccupied with torturing and humiliating blacks, so there is no need to dehumanize them any further. Will some savior please rise and rid the world of this evil?""Django Unchained"" tells the sentimental education of this savior, Django, that ends with the exit of his teacher. Now the Hate is strong with this one. He uses it for the righteous cause, to kill white people. All of them. The murders of the self-righteous are always cool and justified, right? Hypocrisy is the new religion. Tarantino is one of its high priests, ""Django Unchained"" is a High Mass. Enjoy!""Once Upon a Time in the West"", ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"", ""Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid"" - those are masterworks. ""Django Unchained"" is the work of a slave, designed to debase its audience."
tt0114369,"The filter, the rain and the depressing elements from the city in general set the dark, mysterious vibe of the movie, grabbing your attention from the start.The actors are, as expect, amazing are delivering their lines and had a lot of chemistry with each other. The dinner scene was especially super natural and spontaneous.I also really enjoyed how the film isn't scared to show heavy gore in the victim's scenes.But, to be honest, the plot was not as intriguing as I was hoping for. Sometimes, the investigation seemed kinda forced, like they were really lucky to find answers. Maybe my expectations were way too high. Still one of the coolest thrillers I have ever seen tho."
tt0167260,"Minus the special effects there is nothing redeeming about this movie. The characters are one dimensional. The story lines (of which there are several) are predictable and uninteresting. The ending is far far far too long and completely unnecessary. Even the way this movie is filmed isn't particularly interesting. Every third shot seemed like a pull away crane shot or an aerial computer generated fly by. The film did do a good job of wrapping up the trilogy, but otherwise I was unimpressed with this movie and the other two for that matter.What really bothers me is that contemporary movies, especially science fiction movies get rated so highly on this site. There is no way this movie is better than Casablanca or La Dolce Vita. Yes, I would say it was mildly entertaining for a popcorn movie, but at 3 hours it was just too much."

tt0468569,"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The actors are good, as is the cinematography and the editing, but that's that. The script is a bunch of completely rubbish lines with no real meaning and special effects that have been done thousands of times and aren't interesting enough to keep our attention. The score is distracting.The villain is the most implausible villain I have ever seen. People who do evil things have purposes, the Joker doesn't have any. Even if there was a person like that, s/he wouldn't be able to have minions, because that kind of madness isn't a shared one. People kill for power or revenge, (or money, which is another type of power), basically. They have to have a purpose to unite and do evil things. All of the BS the joker said about evil and good completely miss the point about good, evil and humanity. They simply don't make sense.And what makes me furious is the fact that a lot of intelligent (or at least more or less intelligent) people are quoting those lines as if they meant anything. They don't. And they aren't even entertaining."
tt0848228,"Has the global situation grown so bleak that the populace has regressed to comic books for escapism entertainment? Judging by the enormous popularity of everything cinematic based on superheroes and sci-fi extravaganzas I suppose the answer is 'Yes!' To sit in one place for an excess of 2 ¬Ω hours and witness the destruction derby that is the apocalyptic bad guys (in the form of a light spear carrying Loki (Tom Hiddleston) against Samuel L. Jackson's SHIELD cast of make-believe folks - Robert Downey, Jr in armor, Chris Evans in his Captain America Halloween costume, Mark Ruffalo unconvincingly transforming into the Hulk, Chris Hemsworth as hammer wielding Thor, Scarlett Johansson as a pretty Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye all out to make life sustainable for the leasers like Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Clark Gregg, and Colbie Smulders - is a feat in itself.For movies of this type this one has more color and imaginative loco devices that most and therefore I suppose it remains at the top of the heap. When will these characters run out of tales? The answer likely is 'When the movie public stops ling up for these epics.'Grady Harp"
tt0111161,"The amazing thing about this film is how many people fail to realise that the film is about Red, not Andy. It's Reds perspective of Andy. I only mention it because many people strangely think its told from the perspective of Andy.That common misunderstanding behind, a well made film. The photography is magical, the story is strong, the performances are exceptional and the depths of despair and humanity of canvassed well without losing mainstream appeal.But that aside, there is a strong willingness to overstate this film. In the end, it is a slightly overdone and there is a bit too much 'triumph of the human spirit' dribble on the side. But I don't let that get in the way of what is otherwise a very good film with re-watch-ability.Hadley's release from prison and letter deserves a spot in cinema history. That part was absolutely exceptional."
tt0372784,"I've seen all the Batman movies. Most aren't that deeply lodged in my memory. I know that the scene stealers in most of them are the villains. This movie puts it on the strong shoulders of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The movie is about him and his ghosts and his baggage. It is about a man coming to grips with immense guilt. It goes into great detail to explain to us how Batman came to be. It has verisimilitude. The bad guys are, of course, really exaggerated in their evil plans. Everything is neatly plotted. There is fragility in both the character of Wayne and the city he and his family loved. Organized crime abounds and he must face it pretty much alone. I was quite impressed with Inspector Gordon (Gary Oldmann). He was believable and fragile, yet committed to what was right amidst a culture of evil (even on the police force). Like is so often the case, I can't speak for the people who know these comics so well that they fall into depression when a movie doesn't follow their dictates; yet, I really was involved in this. This is quite an all star cast with excellent direction with a bleakness that Tim Burton also did well. I think it was one of last year's best films."
tt0133093,"The Matrix is a top-notch action movie on top of being science fiction - even a viewer who is disinterested in engaging with the film philosophically can still have a great time. ... The Matrix has a lot to say, but it says it using eye-popping visuals and action. A movie that talks at you has limited value.Perhaps the most important impact The Matrix has had on cinema is how it polished the reputation of the blockbuster action film. ... Others say that the world we see in The Matrix is in fact a simulation built by humans and implanted into machines, so the machines believe they have dominated humanity.The Matrix trilogy suggests that everyone has the individual responsibility to make the choice between the real world and an artificial world. Though Neo is the exemplar of free will, fate plays a large role in his adventure. Neo relies on the Oracle, and everything she says comes true in some way."
tt0372784,"The movie focuses on Bruce's childhood where he gets his haunting memories from. It shows how he was to become the prince of Gotham, but things do not turn that way. How he wastes some years of his life and then suddenly how he understands the aim in life. The movie certainly satisfies the viewers that how he actually becomes a batman, and from where he acquires his skills and the stuff which is required. Well if this is a beginning of a ""james bond like series"" then it really is a very good start, otherwise, well it certainly does not cover the whole part of the story. I can say that in comparison to the other ""such movies"", the movie starts a little slow, but for fans like me, who think the more explanation the better, I can say that is this movie is much better off. Well, to be critical some of the objects in the movie do not conform to the actual comic book story, but for a part like that, I suppose they cannot have a thing like that in real. Other than that, a few details are also messed up, but then depends on how well you have read those comic books. On the whole, I can say for fans who just cannot get enough in just 2 hours out of good movies, this movie (and its sequels) are just extravagant."
tt0816692,"This movie is everything I expected it not to be. It was dramatic, but not in a good way. Over dramatic. Far, far too predictable, too Hollywood and anything, and I mean anything but scientific. I'm just going to ask this once - Chris,have you ever actually read any Stephen Hawking? Because then maybe the story line could have taken a turn toward science instead of fairy tale, Hollywood pump up the revenue box office production. Maybe someone on your crew could have consulted with Hawking and came up with an alternate ending. One where people who enter black holes get broken up into their atomic parts such as happens to even light. Instead of some fantasy land Disney ride. Wow what garbage.The trailer in this movie made it look like an amazing adventure in deep space. And yes, don't get me wrong there is space, and a few time deadlines to add in some much needed suspense after one too many porch scenes with Grandpa drinking beer while tending the corn fields. However, what this movie lacked was a sense of logic. I mean really. Flat out.The blight that is taking down the humans seems to be completely overlooked in the movie. There really is no information on it except, our atmosphere has a lot of nitrogen in it which is feeding the blight. ""huh?"" The earth is written off in this movie because of blight? This earth has survived, earthquakes, giant meteorites, plagues, famines, flooding and we are done in by a blight?Fine, we can't feed people so we are headed for the stars, all covertly of course. And our hero just happens to stumble upon NASA. Which wants him to be the pilot, even though he's a reluctant farmer, who was a pilot - because as a pilot he's the best of the best with honors. The script felt like something I would read in an old spaghetti western Clint Eastwood movie. I feel like I threw money away on a cheap plot based on oversimplification of scientific notions and box office greed. And the end: omg it's ""time,"" no, no it's ""gravity,"" no it's time. Just stop. And our protagonist surviving a black hole. What? Because it's not a black hole? Human's built it? Future humans. Probably the one's from Futurama. OK I've seen enough roll credits.However, that said, if you want some good sound, yes the sound was good. Good visuals, nothing gravity didn't do better, and descent acting, almost like Armageddon, yah know, the Bruce Willis stuff. Then indeed this is your movie. Trust me, this is no Inception. If you go, enjoy, just don't go in with high expectations (9.1 on IMDb? really?)or you'll be let down.Oh and the 2001 monolith robots were the highlight of the movie for me. They were good for a couple of laughs. Have a good one."
tt0109830,"For anyone who grew up in the turbulent Sixties, ""Forrest Gump"" delivers a clever blend of nostalgia mixed with a uniquely creative view of history as experienced by a presumed to be simpleton. While Tom Hanks' character recalls his life with a slow tangy drawl, he variously entertains and educates a host of passengers waiting for the next bus to their intended destination. Some ignore him, some show interest, one even scorns Gump's tale of getting rich in the shrimping business, only to depart before Forrest has a chance to pull out his copy of Fortune Magazine. Life can be like that for those unwilling to listen and learn, casting doubt instead of exploring the truth and keeping an open mind.I got a kick out of Forrest's string of brushes with greatness - the way he taught Elvis how to shake his hips, his unquestioning response to LBJ's inquiry about his war injury, and the way his war time experience inspired John Lennon to write 'Imagine'. There was also that ingenious sequence in which he meets President Nixon, then inadvertently tips off the Watergate scandal. However the most understated and easiest reference to miss was the clever homage paid to the 1969 film ""Midnight Cowboy"", when Forrest wheels Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise) across busy city traffic, and is narrowly missed by a taxi cab. Lt. Dan's response was ""Hey, I'm walkin' here"", just the way Ratso Rizzo did in that earlier film. All that with the 'Everybody Talking at Me' movie theme seamlessly woven in as so many songs of that era were utilized with other aspects of the story.For Forrest Gump, life is not a pretentious path to wealth or fame, but a never ending quest to learn and be a productive human being. Not to mention finding one's own true love. For Forrest, life long friend Jenny (Robin Wright) represents an unfulfilled ideal, one he accepts into his heart while still a young schoolboy and nurturing that relationship platonically throughout his adulthood. For her part, Jenny represents a youthful quest for experiencing life to the fullest, only to make a series of wrong choices that lead her to the brink of suicide. It's fitting that Jenny eventually realizes what Forrest knew all along, that they were made for each other even if outward appearances seemed to dictate otherwise.I've seen this film only a couple times in the past, thinking it was good, but only considering it for it's entertainment value. I guess one of the benefits of getting older is the insight one gains with experiencing life a day at a time and steady as she goes. My viewing of the picture today gave me a greater appreciation for the subtleties offered in the film, and leads me to believe the world would be a better place if there were a little more of Forrest Gump in all of us."
tt0381429,"Without the hype and big financial backing movies such at this one often go unnoticed. I didn't know what to expect when I began watching this movie, but it wasn't long before I was drawn into it and the movie did something I look for movies to do for me - it made me feel. We see a young girl named Heidi who begins by doing a foolish thing, kissing her mother's boyfriend and it goes a little too far just when her mother walks in on them. We don't know what happens to her mother's boyfriend, but Heidi is pretty much forced to leave her mother's home with barely the clothes on her back. What follows is fairly predictable. It doesn't take a genius to know that the world is a hostile place for someone who is without a place to live, money, friends, family and with her only assets being her youth and good looks. As I watched, my heart went out to her and I wondered would even I have taken advantage of her and her situation being so vulnerable and desirable, or would I have taken her under my wing and tried to help her as the child she really was and needed, though some might argue didn't deserve because of her naivet√© and penchant for getting into jams. I imagine many men, especially would be wondering the same thing. I really liked this movie and the acting was first rate and that surprised me given all the actors were total unknowns. If you want to see another movie as good as this one and similar to this, try the French movie called Vagabond."
tt1345836,"After the sudden death of Heath Ledger, many were doubting that Christopher Nolan would continue his version of Batman. In fact, it came as a surprise in 2011 when the film was actually announced.Choosing to not recast the role of the Joker, Nolan elected to bring the Ra's Al Ghul story full circle and make that the central plot of the third and final film of his trilogy.The story is an exposition machine when it begins. Bruce Wayne/Batman hasn't been the latter in eight years due to an injury he sustained and is also battling with grief over the loss Rachel Dawes (still?). His company is reeling after he abandoned a multi-billion dollar energy project, but a board member named Miranda Tate is still trying to get him to go through with it. While this is going on, a new villain is on his way to Gotham named Bane, who kidnaps a doctor and needs him for a specific mission within the city. To make matters worse, Bruce's fingerprints are taken by a cat burglar named Selina Kyle, whom is working for the man who is in charge of Bane and does this in exchange for a clean slate. Also, we follow a new police officer named John Blake, who not only knows Bruce Wayne is Batman but is somehow able to figure out everything the entire rest of the Gotham police can't.There is a ton of story in this film, and the biggest problem is that it not only goes against the Batman mythology established in the comics but it also goes against the first two Nolan movies as well.That's why this film is sort of depressing because it has the ingredients to be great. It's well shot, acted, and has some tremendous sequences. This should have been as good, if not better, than its predecessor based on that but it falls extremely short due to Nolan attempting to push the envelope in areas he shouldn't have.As I stated in my review of The Dark Knight, the film is tremendous until its third act, particularly its ending. The ending is extremely flawed in that movie, and this movie built on that ending, which is the preliminary problem with this entire movie.For one, Batman takes eight years off due to the death of Rachel. I know they throw in the knee injury but as it proves in the movie he was able to get rid of that in no time. That logic just flies right into the face of every Batman comic including the more comedic 1960s version of Batman. This is a character that doesn't give up for anything. Also, making Rachel the excuse is tough to swallow for a character that watched his parents get gunned down in front of him.Another issue is this revenge story that they try to weave with Ra's al Ghul's daughter, Talia. As she poses as Miranda Tate, she does a multi year plan to help Bruce Wayne create a clean energy project that could be turned into a nuclear bomb to destroy Gotham. While I'm happy that a movie took the time to introduce Talia into a live action movie, it was the most convoluted story they could've given her, and is easily one of the worst revenge stories I've ever seen in cinema.Bane is good for the most part. Tom Hardy did fine but he really needed to be the solo villain. Making him the lackey for Talia undid everything they had established for this movie. It also doesn't help that he's killed off so easily.Catwoman was a welcome surprise. Anne Hathaway proved a lot of people wrong and plays it well. Now if only Nolan could have allowed her to be called Catwoman in the movie that would have been awesome. However, in Nolan's realistic world, there's a problem with calling most of these characters by their comic book names.The character of John Blake is interesting, and also infuriating because of the way he's written. I can get by that he knows who Batman really is but the orphanage story that he gives was not the best direction to take with it. Also, it was just weird that they did this M. Night Shyamalan reveal with his legal name being Robin. It was less clever and more throwing a bone to the actual comic fans that would be seeing the film.The ending also doesn't help the film either, because it's also an M. Night Shyamalan reveal. To me, the ending is what made the rest of the film tough to handle, because it was already a difficult plot to fully get behind. And instead of doing the things that you would expect them to do, they elected to swerve the entire audience by doing something else. That can be clever at times, but can be infuriating other times, with the Dark Knight Rises being very much the latter in my eyes.So overall, I love the film for its look, the cinematography is great, the action is serviceable, and the acting can be downright brilliant. However, the storytelling and the plot just go down a deep rabbit hole with no chance of climbing out. It does way too much and creates more questions than it does answers."
tt0816692,"I won't give it a 1 to even things up a little, I give it a 6 which is real. Maybe 6.5 but 7 would be a stretch. I'm disappointed with a film that I waited for so long, with a great title that was waisted. Interstellar should have been a masterpiece, with, well, a lot of Interstellar traveling. The duration is just to long, especially the first part, which brings nothing extra to the story. It's just to stretched out trying to bring I don't know what. A feel of 2001 maybe, but 2001 is in another galaxy for this one. I didn't like Inception either, so maybe it has got to be something with Nolan. I'm a sci-fi fan, but today everyone's trying to make sci-fi, but they don't succeed. They are doing it wrong! District 9 was the last good sci-fi I watched. Interstellar has got great visuals, I give it that, but Gravity had more (another film that sucked big time). I wouldn't watch it again."
tt0137523,"There are three things that made this movie iconic: Brad Pitt's body, the huge twist, and the ending with ""Where is my mind"" by the Pixies. Because of those things, people tend to rate this movie higher than it actually deserves. The story itself is forgettable. The plan being carried out by Tyler in the movie is forgettable. What we remember is the dissociative disorder twist that no one saw coming (kind of like The Sixth Sense) and everyone had to run back and watch the movie again to verify or understand that it had been that way the whole movie. After that second viewing, there is really no need to watch this movie ever again (also like The Sixth Sense). But we love to reward movies for stuff like that the first time around. But I tried watching this movie again recently for what would have been my third time, and I was bored with it. You will be too."
tt0993846,"De Caprio is the heart of the film, a daredevil whose motivation seems to be a misguided desire to acquire as much money as possible. He lives his life as a constant dare, using and abusing the investments of others, gambling with his personal relationships and his own health. He constantly endangers his life and those who are closest to him. It seems like he is capable of stopping this fall, but he keeps sinking and sinking. We could say he has a survivor's nature, but he carries with a very intense death wish, too.Usually, it's easy to understand how people like him become so successful. There's gotta be a bit of charisma to their natures, so that we can see how they seduce the rest of the world into following them. Unfortunately, the main lead here lacks that quality, and in one of the worst casting choices in recent history, what we get is a man who is not full of life and youth. He himself become his own iceberg as he reveals his ""age"" early in the film, and De Caprio hasn't looked that youthful in decades. This is not to say that De Caprio doesn't try, but he's not a good fit for this role. About three years ago, in ""The Social Network"" we could see the recklessness and drive of man who could lure you into a trap. There's no way that seems believable here, especially when you see the people he surrounds himself with. His wolf can't cast a spell, and he can hardly bite.Mercifully, we are not treated to the hyper kinetic editing and camera work we usually encounter in Scorcese's films, but he's found other ways to annoy us. He intermingles ""Infomercials"" throughout the movie, as if we need reinforcement about the seductive power of his character. They are sometimes ridiculous, and I doubt that is the intent. There are also liberties with the source, and it's a pity because the text is a delight to read, giving us the opportunity to wonder how something that is definitely based on reality can appear so unbelievable. The movie tries desperately to portray the excess and trappings of wealth, but there is nothing sexy about the constant parade of prostitutes and the overuse of obscenities, which occur at least every other minute. The books gives us time to breathe. Nothing like that is ever possible here, and that's why the film feels flat, not necessarily boring, but it fails to crackle because it's just too much of the same, never showing us where all the madness originates. There's little fire, just an endless portrayal of stupidity.Not all is lost (like in that other film) because we have a rising star here. Margot Robbie makes quite an entrance and gives the best and most solid performance here, enhanced by the mess the rest of the cast comes up with. She's a formidable beauty, with lots of ambition, an overpowering stare that will let you see that she is not afraid to seek ambition, but she is still a full human being, capable of distinguishing between right and wrong. She reminds you of a more powerful Sharon Stone in her earlier films, and she is as talented as she is gorgeous. Here we see how one person can become obsessed with another, but it also makes you wonder why anyone would even stray from such a beauty. Oh, yes, I forgot it's perfectly obvious drugs can totally ruin your life and turn you into a monster.The film is way too long, with more than a dozen scenes that could have been eliminated because they don't add anything to the story flow. We wish we could see more of the FBI agents, and it would be helpful to see why Wolf doesn't seem to find any way to listen to his father, a wonderful and underused Reiner.We can guess the film's ending from its early frames. It seems as if all the energy goes into the presentation of the material, and little consideration is giving to the dialogue, other than peppering the conversations with redundant expletives. Parading naked people around, having snorting line after line of that white powder, or coming up with sound blasting songs to underscore a point is a brutal point to deliver a message. Just recently the Coens gives us a more dimensional creation with no more than a few ungrateful remarks here and there. All the time I could only wonder how it was that this film escaped the stamping of that NC 17 rating because its only success was the abuse of visual imagery and irritating language that loses its impact as it appears in an endless barrage of mind numbing utterances."
tt0114369,"This movie seems to have just one purpose, to show the limitless depravity of the human race.  It's artful. Well acted. It is unforgettable. It will take a piece of your soul from you, and you'll never get it back. I am not a better or wiser person for having seen this movie. And I was not entertained. The movie takes from the viewer and gives nothing in return. You'll be a better person for not seeing it."
tt0422272,"Quickly said: the premise and unfolding of the story is predictable, even if it tries not to be. The setting, a soon-to-be-closed hospital built in a remote and difficult to be reached island, is really nothing new. And, good as she is in this movie, one has to wonder what Calista Flockhart is doing in a Spanish production. But the worst thing of all is that in the final act the movie unforgivably cheats on the audience: without spoiling it at all, during the plot, a rule have been set quite clearly. But in the end, for no apparent reason other than to give to movie a happy ending, the rule is subverted. Should the screenwriter (or the director) have been brave enough to drive the movie to its logical conclusion, it would have been much more interesting and much less annoying."
tt0109830,"This movie, nothing more than a cheesy scenes needlessly thrown together, truly has no heart or point to it, and is among the worst that I have seen. It attempts to do everything without focusing its attempts. Just like the way that a person who tries to multitask only does a semi-good job on either task, this movie does no good job at anything. If the movie were sped up, it would seem like a parody of Hollywood films. I am honestly shocked that anyone enjoyed this film. Not only did the Oscars like it, they liked it more than ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", both among the best movies of all time,and both released in the same year."
tt1853728,"I only had one thought on my mind for this Christmas: see Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino's latest opus, a Western set two years before the Civil War, concerns a former slave named Django (Jamie Foxx). He is freed by bounty hunter Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) in order to help him with a bounty. Quite quickly, Shultz takes Django under his wing and trains him as his partner. But he made him a promise: that he would rescue his wife from a plantation owned by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). And rescuing her is not going to be all that easy.What pains me the most about Django Unchained, as a die-hard Tarantino fan, is just how sloppy it all seems. I enjoyed every minute of it, but I could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels. Portions of the film feel episodic (the search for the Brittle Brothers, mentioned heavily in the trailers, begins and ends practically within minutes), and some scenes just seem to play out just for the fun of it. Another scene from the trailers involving a lynch mob with bags covering their faces seems added for comedic purposes, and has no real point of actually existing. More than any of his films before it, Django feels like Tarantino simply making a movie for sheer pleasure and with no outside motivations or controllers.The film threatens to go totally off the rails at any given moment, and lacks any real sense of direction or focus. It may sound ridiculous, but the loss of editor Sally Menke confirms a sneaking suspicion I always had about Tarantino ‚Äì he needed a steady right hand to help encourage him as to what was needed and what was not. I do not want to criticize Django's editor Fred Raskin, but it is obvious he is no Menke and that works against the film heavily. It lacks the polish we have come to expect, and is practically stripped of the glossy/cool texture so prevalent in Tarantino's work up until now.But then maybe that was his intention all along, and perhaps Tarantino is airing out his frustrations with life and film in general. Django is deliberately shot on film (or at least from the print I saw), and looks very gritty and messy at all times. It is significantly more brutally violent than anything he has worked on before (the borderline cartoonish Kill Bill included), and has a very go for broke attitude about itself. The film seems to revel in how brilliantly it can splatter all the blood and gore (done through the use of squibs and no digital!), and how uncomfortably numbing it can make the violence. I know he does not care what people think of his films, but this movie especially seems like an emphatically raised middle finger to the establishment. And for all of my complaints about how messy it all feels, I was never once bored or felt like the movie was dragging itself out. The staggering 165-minute running time shockingly flies by faster than you might ever imagine.Acting wise, Tarantino stacks the deck with a number of recognizable character actors young and old for roles that vary in size. Most have very few lines, if any at all, and seem to just stand by, just as content as the audience is to watch the action unfold. It is a little off-putting, especially with how important some of these characters are initially made out to be. Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft (one of the most subtle references he's ever dropped) does well as the helpless victim and frequent dreamlike object ‚Äì but she never really gets to show off any of her acting prowess outside of her facial reactions. They are increasingly effective, especially during horrific flashback scenes. But her work here feels ridiculously stunted in comparison to the other leads. Samuel L. Jackson, much like Tarantino himself, seems to just be having fun in his role as Candie's adviser Stephen. He plays on every ridiculous stereotype he ever has been associated with and then amps it up to a near ludicrous state. He is frequently hilarious, but the role seems to border on parody more than anything else.Surprisingly, Foxx takes a very long time settling into the leading role. It may just be the character, but it is quite clear from the on- set that he is not very comfortable in Django's shoes, and leads credence to why Will Smith, amongst so many others, dropped out of the picture so quickly. But once he finds his footing, he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. It is not an easy character to play, but Foxx makes it his own, bringing a sense of style and grace that are virtually absent from the rest of the film. And of course, he gets all the best lines.Waltz and DiCaprio are the clear standouts however, nailing every nuance of their sadly underwritten characters. While Waltz plays the straight man, DiCaprio is delightfully unhinged and vicious. Both are playing directly against type, yet are strangely comfortable in the roles. Watching them act circles around the rest of the cast, Foxx included, is the true highlight of the film. I just wish they were both given additional emphasis and more to do.For all of its numerous faults, I had a blast watching Django Unchained. It is hilarious, it is a lot of fun, and is wildly enjoyable. I genuinely think it could have been a lot better if there was more focus and direction, but this is very clearly a picture Tarantino wanted to make on his own terms. And for that, I applaud him for the effort. It is not his best work, but certainly not his worst.8/10."
tt0108052,"The story and form of the film is moving and engage the audience in to dramatic core of the film. What I have observed more as specific talent and skill of the director is mood and tone of the film being transformed to the audience; heartbreaking sequence of the film where Jews are moved toward the gas chamber and moments later where the smoke comes out is utter shock and depression which we as audience feel it, also the camera shot choice and composition makes the sequence identical.The hand-held camera in some sequences has achieved the aim of the filmmaker to engage the audience into story shift between objective to subjective point of view. For instance where the Jewish women being run into the chamber and the doors are locked on them, apart from the suspense of being burnt in the chamber which we see is not the case and they have shower, the audience feels the tension and terror in the scene."
tt0102926,"I recently watched the acclaimed movie after hearing many positive comments about it. The storyline was beautifully composed and kept me interested through all of its length. I loved how each character contributed to the overall story line, as well as the way they were portrayed in their own unique moments throughout the movie. There was suspense, action, intrigue, horror, investigation and more. I just learned that there are five movies that follow this story (Hannibal Rising, Manhunter, Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal) and I cannot wait to watch them all. I would highly recommend this movie to be added to everyone's ""must see"" list!"
tt0120737,"J. R. R Tolkein's books are wonderful, with memorable characters, an enchanting atmosphere, strong narrative and dialogue and an epic story. Peter Jackson's trilogy mayn't be necessarily true to them, but it does have the memorable characters, the epic story and enchanting atmosphere that the books do. The Fellowship of the Ring is probably the weakest of the three, but it is a very solid start. It is I agree slower in pace to the other two, and there are some talky scenes that drag it down a tad."
tt0133093,"Take a bit from ""Men in Black"" (leave the humor out) something from ""Last Man Standing"" (leave good acting out) from ""Twelve Monkeys"" (leave real suffering and compassion out) and take half a dozen other ones (like some ""Martial Arts"") mix it and get a block buster. Hey, add a deep philosophical idea like that maybe everything is unreal!It sounds like a joke but it is not. They actually got away with it with ""The Matrix"". I mean probably every bright 15 year old comes up with the idea one day that everything is fake that somehow only he (or she?) can see through it. And I do not say you cannot make a film out of it but has the result to be like this? The Matrix is by far the most stupid film I ever saw. I want to believe in bizarre concepts but this is so mind-boggingly stupid that it would mean too much honor to even start talking about it. I have seen a lot of senseless violence but this must get a price for the best pretext: They can ""beam"" into a particular ""space-time"" point of the program but not quite so our heroes have to literally shoot their way through. Amazing! The sad thing about it is that people actually enjoy the crap which makes me think that the Matrix probably is true after all. Since it seems unlikely that real people with a mind of their own can take the film seriously or enjoy it there must be some brain-washing or programming going on. My girl friend nearly left me once because I liked a ""horrid"" movie like ""Twelve Monkeys"" and even she liked The Matrix. She probably hopes that Jesus will look and act like Keanu Reeves at his next coming. What a depressing thought. If the only good thing to say about a film is that visual effects were up to standard one should leave it. The sun glasses were pretty cool though."

Seriously guys??? This film has 5/10 stars at best, and even that for just potential. Rest of it is lost because the film has absolutely no logic to it.Stupid, illogical and at times really boring and long.

tt0120737,"I have heard so many things about this movie it is unbelievable.  I have seen this movie twice, read the books, and I can say for sure that it is not the 2nd best movie of all time.  It is also ridiculous that this movie won the AFI best picture of the year against ten other briliant spectacular movies.The first time I saw the movie everyone in my group was half and half on the opinion of weather they liked the movie.  Some people thought it was dreadfull and were upset with me for making them see a 3 hour movie that they thought was ""stupid.""  Others thought the movie was wonderfull but no one thought it was the best movie of the year.  I thought the movie was average but when other people wanted to see it I thought I would give it a second chance.The second time I saw it was a different experience.  I liked the first half of the movie better but I thought the battle scenes towards the end were ridiculous.  The acting was average but some of those ""1-liners"" were stabbing me in the heart.  For instance, ""Let's hunt some Ork"" was my vote for the most ridiculous line in the movie.I thought the special effects in the movie were amazing but the music and the acting were average.  My favorite character was probably Frodo Bagins or Gandalf.  I thought the movie relied on too much action which the book did not.  Some people I heard said they were bored by the dialogue.  That was my favorite part (besides the ring wraiths) in the whole film.In short I do suggest you see this movie.  Some of you will probably hate it, and some of you will probably like it, but none of you I doubt will worship this movie...even if you've read the books."
tt1345836,"I don't normally review movies unless I feel compelled to do so. In this case, I feel I was duped into expecting a very good movie.

And I won't detail the nonsense that is considered a plot for those that may not have had the displeasure of viewing this movie. There are so many times that I was left shaking my head that I sustained a neck injury just watching this.I like the idea of Bane as a physically powerful foe, I like Anne Hathaway as Catwoman (although her character has serious flaws) and the veterans do their normal commendable job attempting to bring stability to this disaster.I gave it a 3 because I like Batman and I still want to like him. I will put this movie out of my mind so that I continue to like him."

At least when Heath Ledger played Joker he had a storyline and a script that was good to follow. This movie doesn't make any sense and has no real story. They make a movie about how they think a crazy person thinks and acts. HORRIBLE MOVIE!!!
tt0114369,"Good Movie and entertaining plot twist.
But nothing special."
tt0120737,"At the end of this movie, it made me wonder what is the nature of drama and science fiction building for this movie or series.
Throughout this film - which was relatively long in length - he did not explain the importance of each individual and what dimensions would happen if we lost any of them, but he answered himself, is that if we lost any character if he affected us, some characters were interchangeable and without a dramatic build that made me not Sympathy for any character who died, what is the benefit of inserting characters and disposing of them without any dramatic construction that makes us sympathize with them? This is however, it took a long time for us to know the characters presented
As for building this world itself, it carries a lot of problems, such as how important is my knowledge of the number of rings that were made, or what is the importance of the people who carry them, the whole idea focused on one ring! Or what is the importance of those rings basically!
The film suffers from defects on the level of visual effects, and the solution was that they color the film with exaggerated colors in order to hide these defects.
On the level of events, and after reviewing it in my mind after finishing the film, I did not find anything that would serve the future development of events. The film was weak in exposing the dimensions of the world in which the story tells all that happened is to show the skills of characters in adventures that have no cause or meaning in three hours And half.
I did not like the way magic was cast and it was totally unattractive compared to other films like Harry Potter, and by the way Harry Potter was in the same year and it had much better visual effectsIn the end, I liked the original score and sounds and the cinematography, the movie gave us some wonderful staff"
tt1130884,"If Paramount Pictures had released Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island last year ‚Äì the original release date was October 2nd, 2009 ‚Äì I would have considered the film the best movie of the year. As it stands, the rest of 2010 has a long way to go in terms of matching the quality and effectiveness of Scorsese's new picture. It's a fascinating character drama, an exciting and almost experimental exploration of the human mind, a reinvention of the horror genre and a dynamic acting showcase for its star, the incredible and still very underrated Leonardo DiCaprio.Shutter Island is also an incredibly appropriate entry in the Scorsese canon ‚Äì it's a film about an alienated man haunted by his past. Add Teddy Daniels to the list of Scorsese's tragic and multilayered antiheroes ‚Äì Jake La Motta, Travis Bickle, Henry Hill, Howard Hughes, Billy Costigan, Rupert Pupkin, Jesus Christ. The film also continues Scorsese's fascination with our understanding of violence (it should be noted that our perception of the lead character's violent actions changes dramatically when watching the film for a second time).Shutter Island is eerie from the very beginning. U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) steadily approach an island off the coast of Massachusetts known as Shutter Island, a mental hospital for the criminally insane. The year is 1954, and Scorsese and music supervisor Robbie Robertson subtly incorporate vintage (and sometimes downright disturbing) 1950s music into the sound mix. Once on the island, Daniels and his partner meet with Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), who explains to the Marshals that one of the island's patients has mysteriously disappeared overnight. The investigation that ensues is a fascinating exploration of insanity.Hovering over every scene is a paranoid, post-war anxiety shared explicitly by our protagonist and thoroughly felt and realized by Scorsese. Tensions rise as Teddy recalls horrific memories from liberating a concentration camp during the war, and his suspicions of Nazism and conspiracy by the House of Un-American Activities on the island become our suspicions. The best Scorsese films force the audience to live inside the minds of moderately-to-severely delusional characters weighed down by an enormous and overwhelming guilt. Shutter Island does just that. There is an unease throughout the entire film, deliberate disturbances in continuity that some audiences might mistake for sloppy editing. That's simply Oscar-winning editor Thelma Schoonmaker toying with the audience, making us question the reality we're watching and the reliability of our protagonist.The film is a brilliant melding of film noir, detective mystery and psychological horror, at its very core an exploration of an emotionally disturbed human psyche, disguised as a Hitchcockian thriller that works as both a homage to Scorsese's favorite psychological thrillers from the 1940s and 1950s while simultaneously elevating itself into something larger and more complicated. When you watch Shutter Island, you're not just watching Scorsese's film ‚Äì you're watching thousands of classic movies at once, assembled together in a picture conceived by a filmmaker whose encyclopedic knowledge of film history pours into every detail of every frame, so much so that an already-genuinely suspenseful scene of DiCaprio racing up a flight of winding stairs simultaneously serves as a homage to Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's The Red Shoes (1948).Unfortunately, Shutter Island has come under attack from, as my good friend calls them, the pseudo-intellectual crowd. From what I can gather, the general complaint is that the movie takes itself too seriously dramatically, and that some of the dramatic shifts in the film are laughable. Perhaps this is because Scorsese refuses to compromise his vision by winking at the audience. When discussing The Best Films of the 1990s with Martin Scorsese in early 2000, film critic Roger Ebert notes that at some point in the 1990s, existentialism, ""the idea of what we do with our lives,"" was ""replaced by irony, so that everything has quotation marks around it."" He then adds, however, that Scorsese's ""films are not in quotation marks...they are meant.""And he's absolutely right. Scorsese can't make an ironic film - a film too afraid to deal head- on with real, palpable human emotion, therefore putting the actions of its characters in huge quotation marks. My favorite films of the past few years don't have ironic quotation marks around their characters, either. I don't buy movies that do that ‚Äì it's a cheap way of pleasing the cynical, highbrow crowd who only accept genuine human emotion in films if it comes from Pixar Animation or a foreign-language film. I love those movies, too, but I haven't given up on serious American films that aim for high character drama and succeed. I'm talking about Clint Eastwood's Mystic River (2003), Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain (2005) and now, Shutter Island. These are films that take their characters and their plights seriously.Every negative review I've read doesn't seem to consider how effective the film is on a visceral level, how strong and forceful the performances are from top to bottom and the powerful manner in which screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis keeps the story grounded in the deep emotional turmoil of its characters. Shutter Island is a real film, the kind they don't make anymore, exceeding the supposed limitations of its genre and offering its audience something challenging and psychologically fascinating. Scorsese doesn't have to make movies anymore - he's already made more masterpieces than any other living filmmaker - but we're lucky that he's still exploring his obsessions in new and inventive ways. Shutter Island should be met with applause, not simply because the film marks the latest work from our finest living filmmaker, but because it's also the best damn movie you'll see this year."
tt0068646,"If you want to see the quintessential american crime film?  Goodfellas. The Godfather is romanticized garbage in comparison.  Take a look at Coppolas' interviews about the godfather.  It is not a film he was passionate about doing, nor is he proud of the mafia legacy and he was a little bit insulted the studio thought he would do a good job just because he was Italian. Coppola purposely turned the story into a universal tale of a king and his family to avoid the broken, bloody and undressed view of the ""earners"" on the street.  He didnt want to focus on this, because of his aforementioned lack of pride.  He turned the mafia into a fairy-tale.Scorcese created goodfellas with passion and respect.  The line between good and evil was blurred, as it is in real life.  The good stories of the mafia dont come from the ""Don"".  They come from the ""earners"".  The guys in the trenches.  They are what keeps the wheel turning."

From the moment Matt attacked Matthew, I knew the movie was bad.That the crew members would believe Matt's description of the planet is unlikely. The planet was visibly frozenIt will always be pointless to reach the center of a black hole, since it would mean certain death. They tried to describe it as a necessary sacrifice, but the thinking behind was just nonsense.I have no Idea what they tried to illustrate as happening in the black hole. There are no books to be found in a black hole.

tt0372784,"Compared to the movies I have seen these past two years, Batman Begins does an adequate job of putting batman on the screen. However, it is still a bad film.First, I have to establish that I am a fan of the comics, and I really dislike it when movies completely disregard the story and history established in the comic books.With that out of the way, Batman Begins casts Christian Bale, who is the best Batman actor I have seen, but it doesn't say much when you look at the past Batmans. The story is divided into two parts. One talking about the beginnings of Batman, and the second about him saving gotham.As always, 2 villains are cast. Raz-Al-Ghul, and Scarecrow. Scarecrow is played over the top, but that is a good thing as I believe that's how villains should be played in Batman.Raz is a different story. The Raz in the comic is much better, and this one does not do him justice. The actor is very good, but it is the way Raz is portrayed that really disappoints.Then, plot holes. Mr. Wayne wears a tux, but rides the subway. They come out of a high class opera house to the lowest slum. It just does not make sense.Katie Holmes is the most horrible thing about this film. She throws in corny one-liners as if her life depends on it.Bottom line, compared to the stuff I have seen this past 2 summers, Batman Begins is actually entertaining enough to be worth the $5.25, if you are willing to completely forget what you know of the caped crusader."
tt0120737,"lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring, was one of the most entertaining movies of 2001.  it was also highly overhyped.this was a very enjoyable movie, and a very good action movie. of course, being a good action movie, means that it is permissible to overlook mediocre acting, wooden dialogue, stereotyped characters, terrible corny humor, and excessive and sometimes (oftentimes) phony CGI.first, the acting. i have seen people on this board actually suggest that people such as elijah wood, viggo mortenson, and orlando bloom should be nominated for oscars! now, i will grant that the oscars in no way reward the best performances of the year, but that would be carrying things just a bit too far.  of course, it might not be the actors' fault, it could be...the dialogue. i fail to understand why seemingly all ""epic"" films, and fellowship of the ring is no exception, have dialogue that is apparently meant to seem completely contrived.  almost every line feels as though the characters speaking it has put about ten minutes of thought into it, and this is while running from monsters and creepy-crawlies!then there are the characters themselves. we have frodo, the humble little guy that everyone roots for. gandalf, the grizzled, wise sage. aragorn, the pragmatic and skilled leader. legolas, the stoic and noble silent one. and boromir, the greedy, unlikeable human. merry and pippin, the goofball, comic relief.  the list could go on to include almost every character in the movie, but this review is getting long as it is.i believe even fans of the movie will concede that much of the attempted humor is corny and often unbearable (especially the dwarf). if you have seen it, you know what i mean; if not, be glad that you have been spared.and finally what i found to be the biggest flaw: the CGI.  there is just far too much! granted that it some instances it was used with splendid effect, and in these cases, i am all for it. however, just to throw out an example off the top of my head, in the scene in moria, there is no need to have various people jumping on the cave troll's back. it just looks fake! it is entirely unnecessary! what is it doing on my screen? much of the CGI could and should have been cut out.  it detracts from the movie as its overall effect is to give a very impersonal feel to what should be a personal and moving story.well that about sums this rant up, so i will leave you with the following advice: if you are in the mood for a solid action/adventure movie, then fellowship of the ring is for you. but, on the other hand, if you have unwisely chosen to accept the opinion of the lord of the ring freaks on this board that this is a quality film and even one of the top 5 of 2001, then you will be sorely disappointed."
tt0372784,"I have never fallen asleep in the cinema in my life! I thought this film looked pretty good and the cast was impressive, plus i loved the first 4 Batman films but i fell asleep like 20 minutes in and didn't wake till near the end. I guess i can't really comment but i think a movie that puts you to sleep that fast isn't worth spending money on. Plus the story was pretty awful the 'villan' was dumb and it just didn't have anything like the other films. I like the whole fantasy edge to Batman and the way the villains are formed (Joker with the acid, Catwoman with the cats etc) the film has none of this. The continuation from the original Batman was dumb as it was clear that the joker killed Batman's parents yet in this he does not? Basically save your money!"
tt0993846,"Ever had the urge to drive fast after watching a Fast & Furious movie? If you are on the page as me, then beware, The Wolf of Wall Street might make you wanna jump start a career in investment. It is exactly what the protagonist Jordan Belfort motivated his accomplices to do in it. There is always something that you could (not proudly) relate to in a Scorsese movie and in The Wolf of Wall Street its about money and who wouldn't love to relate to it.The Wolf of Wall Street tells the rise of Jordan Belfort, a man with high ambitions and even higher exuberance, how he conquers the stock market, goes over the top and more. This could be considered a rags to riches story and the narrative takes a turn after the second act when the riches phase goes a notch above and becomes greed, power and eventually an inevitable descent. When you are this far down the rabbit hole there ain't no coming back to the surface, unscathed at least. A movie with excessive nudity, sleaze and drug use, The Wolf of Wall Street is exactly how its meant to be and Martin Scorsese has done a job which takes its justified crown at the box office and most likely even at the Oscars. One of the strong points of the movie is humor and Wolf of Wall Street packs it in tons. This is by far Scorsese's funniest movie till date that I developed a cramp in my stomach laughing so much.The Wolf of Wall Street is about 3 hours long and not once did I feel an impatient bladder, I was rooted to the seat eager to know where Jordan was going with it. Agreed Jordan Belfort is not guy you'd want your kids looking up to and his ways are never strictly speaking legal. But despite that you want this guy to emerge at the top for his ambitions, this character is as fun as it can get and who brought life to Jordan? Leonardo Di Caprio of course! This is maybe his 6th collab with Martin Scorsese and you have to owe it to them, they do make a dynamic duo. Leonardo despite his charismatic and magnetic performance in his recent movies never landed him an Academy Award but who cares? He has proved that he is one of the greatest actors of our times who literally steals every scene he's in. For once I wanted to step back from the cosmetic layer of Jordan's pompous life and have a different angle at his ways. But Leonardo Di Caprio's performance was just so captivating and he just didn't give me a chance, there was no stepping back when you have delved this much into being entertained.A stellar supporting cast promises that the screen is always filled with intriguing characters. Jonah Hill especially is a force to reckon with as Jordan's most trusted Donnie. This guy has become the go to guy for brilliant supporting roles and is getting increasingly entertaining, starring in almost all of the Academy Award nominated movies. This is indeed a boy's club where there's little importance for feminine characters and I felt the their roles in the movie were objectified. Of course it'd be Pan Am's Margot Robbie's nude scenes that'd be the talk of the day after watching this movie and it is indeed hard to take your eyes off her but you have to admit it takes a splendid performance to be noticed when you've got a star studded male cast to compete with. Matthew McConaughey, Jean Dujardin, Kyle Chandler and Jon Bernthal equally deserves a thumbs up for their short but memorable roles.Its impossible to deduce how Martin Scorsese had done it. The man's edging over his 70s and has crafted a movie so modern, so energetic and with so much passion that even a younger director would be challenged to top it. I really don't care how he is being criticised for his apparent sleazy glorification of the stockbrokers or for the 506 F-bombs thats been dropped in the whole movie. He just delivered another masterpiece, an edge of the seat dramedy that is on par with most of the his as well as others' best movies ever. I enjoyed every frame of it and was left wanting more. Relentlessly funny, loud & ceaselessly crazy, The Wolf of Wall Street in undeniably one of the best movies of 2013 and is by far the best time I had at the movies in recent times."
tt0429078,"A rip-roaring romp of Chinese martial arts that assaults the senses in a sequence of innovative and clever fights that use the full range of tricks and some new ingenious weapons in the hands of the baddies. The bad guys camp it up more than I have ever seen Asians do, with white face paint, weird weapons, outright callousness and awesome bad guy names (Mud-Trot anyone?). They're great fun, and if anything they are not quite matched by the good guys although the Dragon Sword character has some real Oriental enigma that erupts regularly in fiery passion.Is it a good film? It's great fun, the choppy editing, especially at the very beginning when the heroes are summoned, is confusing (maybe more for a non Chinese audience, I'm not sure) but it's well worth a look if you like action. As has been said, this is more Bruce Willis than Ingmar Bergman, and that's not a bad thing."
tt1345836,"He's getting too old for this sh*t. Apparently.I am reminded of Lethal Weapon 4 (hell, Part 3 was the beginning of that series) during The Dark Knight Rises. True, people grow old and weary, but these are fictional characters and that's not what I wanted to see, for Gotham's sake. Likewise, I wouldn't welcome Sean Connery's return as Bond in today's world ‚Äì I want to see my ""super"" hero be just that, not one hobble from retirement and doesn't ""go back for that one final job"" clich√©.Allow me to explain. In The Dark Knight Rises, many years have passed from the previous installment ‚Äì although you wouldn't know it with the many flashbacks, Bruce is sequestered and all-but in a wheel chair. Naturally, someone(s) sparks life back into the ancient Wayne and back-from-retirement comes Batman.Now, stating Batman returns (again) is not a spoiler ‚Äì but this is: don't get used to seeing Batman for too long. He's in barely 10% of an almost 3-hour film. This very well-crafted film with very good cinematography and deep characters ‚Äì both older, established ones and new ones, is an entertaining character-driven story, but light on both action and Batman.Personally, I like my Superhero/Comic Book movies with the actual Superhero at center stage. Obviously, that wasn't the goal, and so be it. It was entertaining for the other aspects.Bane (a barely understandable and muffled Tom Hardy) enters the realms of Gotham with a mission ‚Äì and bang while burglar Selina Kyle (a delicious Anne Hathaway) steals various items for (no spoiler, but for very, very weak) reasons of her own. After countless conflicts with practically dozens of character pairs, Gotham is under siege and it's up to a broken man to ""learn to pick himself up"" again and save the day.(I really didn't want to give away the majority of the story or spoil any more ‚Äì but in a nutshell, that's the gist.)While the movie isn't terrible, or bad by most reasons, it's filled with plot holes, pacing issues and a grand minimum of 40+ minutes could have been cut easily. That all said, it's worth a viewing and it was a nice conclusion to the Dark Knight trilogy. Also, I loved Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anne Hathaway and their characters.Suggestions for the inevitable reboot: MORE BATMAN. Oh, and keep a great story with great performances, definitely, but fit MORE BATMAN in there, please. Please."
tt0068646,"When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film ""a long, boring piece of crap."" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality.Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, ""never take sides against the family."" That is when crazy things begin to happen.The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the filmThis is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl¬Ö..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.My Grade: A-"
tt0111161,"Frank Darabont directed this superb adaptation of the Stephen King novella that stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a young banker who was wrongfully convicted for the murders of his wife and her boyfriend. Upon arrival at Shawshank prison in Maine, he keeps to himself mostly, causing no trouble, though does befriend long-time inmate ""Red' Redding(played by Morgan Freeman) who teaches him the ropes of prison life, though the unwanted attentions of degenerate inmates pushes poor Andy to the edge of despair, until his financial skills as a banker prove most useful to both the corrupt Captain of the guards(played by Clancy Brown) and corrupt warden(played by Bob Gunton) until Andy hits upon a most clever escape plan... Now legendary film that sits atop the IMDb best film list is indeed a worthy film(though not my pick!) Still, done with remarkable skill on every filmmaking level. Could be viewed as an allegory of Christianity, but is indeed an uplifting story of friendship and the human spirit. Supporting characters(except for the one played by James Whitmore) aren't that appealing, but aren't intended to be either! Perfect ending as well."
tt0114369,"I always take the trouble to write an IMDb review when I think a movie is too horrible to watch - the good ones, I am sure people can find them without me.This movie is rotten to the core. It does not entertain a sensible mind. It does not uplift. It has not humor, no fun, no moral. It is morbid, depressing, meaningless. But it is not meaningless like, say, life. Life's meaninglessness has a depth, it is somber. The meaninglessness of this movie is like a small child killing a white rabbit - wanton, senseless, rabid.What did you learn from this movie? What did you enjoy? What moved you? Nothing unless you admire gore and violence per se. Yes, the acting, especially of KS, was superb. But I do not see any glamor in superbly acting the part of a mad killer. The mad killer can do it himself.Anyways, I am rambling; but after a movie like this, you are at a loss for words. You wonder what kind of people spend a million dollar on a movie like this. You wonder what kind of people go to watch it. You wonder, most of all, how someone can enjoy spending money on this rather than giving some money to, whoever."
tt0108052,"This movie was one of the most beautiful and impressive films I have ever seen. It is very naturalistic and logical to make everything as objective and realistic as possible. The film, which tragically unfolds the events of World War II, is a great reminder of human beings at the same time. The time is very clear in the sense of space. I would strongly recommend anyone watching. Good forums."
tt0110912,"In my opinion one of the most overrated movies of all time. This is the worst Tarantino movie out there, I dont understand the movies popularity. Its just so bad and it doesnt make any sence. But on the other hand the acting is good and Samuel L Jackson is as good as you can expect. I guess it is just not for me and maybe you will like it."
tt0137523,"I know my critic is unpopular, but this film has a lot of inconsistencies in the plot. Firstly, how the club becomes so popular that office workers, policemen, bus drivers, taxi drivers, etc. participate in it...? it sounds like nonsense, doesn't it? Secondly, they become so powerful that they change into a sort of terrorist army that destroys official buildings in a fight against materialism... if they're so powerful, why do they need to destroy buildings? Thirdly, the film reaches in its final part a pretended twist-in-the-end in which the main character suffers a double personality syndrome; apart that this has been yet treated in films like Psycho, in the film it's something more than a psychriatic disturbance; it's like a 'ghostly syndrome', since the main character seems to be hit by a ghost as can be seen in the vigilance cameras' images, and he finally shots himself in his mouth and doesn't die. You can build a brainy interpretation about everything, and say it's an allegory about the problems in modern society and the like, but for me it's not that profound. Also, the comic moments -like the man with the big breasts'- are for me tasteless. And the extreme violence unnecessary. I'll give it a 6 out of 10, and I think I'm being generous with my rating."
tt0109830,"When FORREST GUMP came out in the 90s, i really liked it, but nowadays..... I don't hate it, but I don't like it either. It's a bit like America itself. The technology (the special effects) are good, but overal it's overhyped, shallow and full of cliches. The story goes on and on, not much is happening."
tt1853728,"This is nominated for best picture? You got to be kidding me. Where are the sweeping themes, the original ideas, the unique contribution to cinema? This is just a remake of a spaghetti western/blaxploitation movie, with the same old funky soundtrack, the same old movie homages, plot tricks, blood splatter, etc. It was fresh and original in Pulp Fiction, but half a dozen movies later, it is becoming formula. But, wait, I forgot, this is a savage indictment of slavery. Hahahaha. This is movie nerd Tarantino stealing other directors' ideas and painting the world in ludicrously simplistic black-and-white, in Technicolor, so that the bad guys are so detestable you'll cheer graphic violence and mass murder. This time it was slavers, last time it was Nazis, what clich√© bad guys will be next? Terrorists? Vampires? In a musical homage? How long can this juvenile director keep spinning the same old blood-spattered revenge theme in a genre remake? This is not cutting edge cinema, folks. Using the N-word does not make you a daring film genius. Now if Quentin spent his multi-million budgets on a movie about, say, a father whose daughter was gunned down in a mass shooting, and goes on a killing spree at the NRA headquarters or a Hollywood studio, I'd be just as disgusted but at least I'd call him original. Well, no, it would be just more twisted clich√©, like all Tarantino movies these days."
tt1375666,"This movie is so predictable that it takes all of 10 minutes to figure it out. At that stage you know you're going to waste another 2 and a half hours watching the nonsense where people slip in and out of dreams in an attempt to fabricate a story where there was no story.The plot starts in the first few minutes and ends in the last few minutes, everything in between... well... is better left unwatched.If you haven't figured it out immediately, then chances are you won't by the time it's over, in which case you're also wasting 2 and a half hours of your time.The only thing I got from watching this horrible overrated bloated cinematic experiment was a wish to kill myself. Maybe I'm dreaming, too?"
tt0109830,"I don't get it. Not a bad movie, but I must have missed something, I do not understand why all the hype or why it is considered a 'great' movie. The emperor has no clothes. A couple of laughs, I guess a nice message about living a life with quiet dignity, and a bunch of absurd and nonsensical stuff thrown in for no apparent reason. Interesting when shining a light on the destructive, hypocritical, and hedonistic underside of the 60's movements, should have kept it going instead of getting too silly."
tt1853728,"This movie is definitely a bit of a revenge fantasy, a sort of reimagining what it would be if there was someone who stood up against the brutality of slavery of old-timey American, and used a BLOODY GUN to do so instead of diplomacy.Jamie Foxx delivers a very good performance as Django (though I've heard rather unpleasant things about what he said about his experience shooting the movie), and Christoph Waltz is....... Christoph Waltz. Easily one of my favourite charming European actors. DiCaprio is amazingly believable as the narcissistic and blatantly racist Candy. In the end, the cast is very very good and the story, which follows the usual revenge narrative arc culminating in a bloody (a bit TOO bloody, actually imo) shootdown, is predictable and fun.It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it's good popcorn fun, and a howling gun-toting bloody good time if that's what you're looking for. With a little twist of having DiCaprio playing a depraved antagonist."
tt0848228,"Well it is all shiny and stuff to have all the super heroes together but without any real plot its just a lot of soulless fireworks with an attempt to manufacture a positive response from the audience.. With the indestructible nature of the hulk and Thor, what need is there of the rest..As for the wit element bought to us mainly by iron man it is overdone.. There has to be a balance to take the viewers on a true ride of emotion, suspense and overall awe.. elements that this movie just does not have..I still do not understand how this can get a rating above 7, which brings about an element of doubt as to the rating system and credibility of all rated movies on this site."
tt0361748,"This was definitely one of the weakest films by Tarantino. And there was a simple reason why.He chose too serious and dramatic topic for his style. Yes, it fitted perfectly for Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs but to rape World War II in that way is a bit too much.First scene was very promising when the Nazi was explaining the French man why Nazi regime hates Jews. Secondly we were introduced to Inglorious Basterds. The group of brutal Jews killing Nazis. First I thought it was a fine idea but later it got pretty tiring.Then everything started to go downwards. Too long table scene showed the Jew girl Emanuelle who had escaped in the beginning from Nazis thinking about showing the great Nazi movie in her cinema. Afterwards another very long and weak table scene came by which ended with shooting.And then the finale where Emanuelle let her lover burn down the Nazis filled cinema including Adolf.Some big mistakes were that the table scenes and empty discussions were awful. They didn't lead nowhere. History rewriting in such a way wasn't believable as well. All great Nazis including Hitler were killed in a movie theater. And finally of course Tarantino's jokes which for me have been usually fine but put in such a plot wentjust too far.Still, if you can put it up you may enjoy this film. I wouldn't say it was a complete waste of time but Tarantino crossed the line from where it got controversial for even myself.More on the plus site there was some fine acting, some laughs and overall interesting point of view.So let's just say below average, don't expect it to be Pulp Fiction.. 4/10"
tt0137523,"l have seen the movie, and skipped the end (l was TOLD that it is the most important part, and they also told me what it was). l just couldn't stand it. l know l have to see it again someday in order to have an idea about the full piece, but l just find it repellent...l think it is violent beyond any good taste, and nothing justifies it - the end is not important, not strong enough, and not worthy sitting for so long, watching something l can see if l open my news on TV. when l saw it, it was broadcasted with no censorship (""+13"", for example), and beyond the fact l had no idea what l am about to see, l could have entered to this movie with my little brother, who is too young and cannot filter it.l heard opinions that were fascinated by the philosophic side - the ""philosophy"" in it can be compared to Paulo Coalo's and Richard Bach's literature - not very deep, very commercialized, and it forced you to see things that you are not aware to their influence on you in the process."
tt0120815,"When it came out, Saving Private Ryan was lauded for it's ""realistic depiction of war,"" and for its ""attention and sensitivity to the common man caught up in the sway of forces far beyond his control."" It was supposed to be a story about the men more than a story about the war.Unfortunately, it was none of these things.The message of this movie seems to be that war is a very deeply affecting and moving experience, as long as you're an American. Common everyday plain old American Teachers, as shown by Tom Hanks' character, are sent into the fray and forced to become fighting men. We are shown, however, that the humanity of that Teacher is still there, even as he is fighting the ""Evil Bloodthirsy Germans.""And this is where my problem lies. How can a movie that uses cookie cutter Nazis, that treats German soldiers as simply ""the enemy,"" even make the claim that it is a realistic depiction of war? Somehow, only the Americans in Saving Private Ryan have a human component, the Germans conveniently having lost theirs. Compare this with the Japanese soldiers shown in The Thin Red Line and you'll see that Saving Private Ryan's praise for being an understanding and sensitive picture of that war is little more than a joke.Now, I'm not saying i do not understand why the Germans are depicted as so flat. If I were Jewish and had family members who had been in concentration camps, I probably wouldn't be able to depict Germans in anything but a dehumanized capacity either. Having said that, however, the dehumanizing of the enemy, the labeling of a people and the flattening of their character and humanity, is what allowed the Germans to kill so many Jews.This movie is anything but a realistic depiction of the Second World War."
tt0120737,"I don't get the hysteria around this movie. What is it that people are going mad for? It just seems like generic high fantasy that every Power Metal album is telling (much more enjoyably in my opinion).I get it's based on a book that defined fantasy fiction for a generation but that doesn't make it any less dated. Dorian Grey was written even earlier but it's movies still seem fresh.What really gets me with this movie is how SERIOUS it is. I don't mind a serious movie and I am very willing to believe a fantasy story can have just as much substance and nuance as a novel by Dostoevsky (I presume he has depth, I've never read him).But this is SO stone faced it becomes risible. And no, it's not some kind of adult take on the fantasy genre. An adult movie wouldn't be so simplistic as to color code the horses. The Nazgul OBVIOUSLY have to ride black horses while the elf (who is WAY TO TALL to be an elf) just as obviously missed the sale on black horses and gets a palamino. Because good guys ride white horses. Nothing to do with ethics or tenacity, it's all the horse.This movie has nothing to say beyond ""once upon a time some little people had a magical adventure where they had to go from A to B"" and nothing else beyond this.Maybe the other movies expand on certain themes, I have not seen them. Don't tell me the ring is a metaphor for corruption or impunity like the Ring of Gyges because they do nothing with this idea other than make it a good ex machina.What recommends the movie is the behind the camera talent. It all looks pretty stunning but a lot of it is simply wasted since the story gives me no reason to really care about this world or any of the bland under developed characters. I am literally more invested in the narrative in Rhapsody of Fire Concept albums based on the sparse usage of spoken word. I really feel Ralph Bakshi, while maybe not having the same technical skill or resources to realizes this world so impressively, just had a better understanding of how to not just make a world look real but feel as it's a place I could go and want to go.The hammed up, over-acting, the cheesy lines, the paper thin plot stretched to breaking point over 170 minutes (I was thinking at one point that the movie wasn't half bad so long as they wrap it up soon and an HOUR later they did), the only aspect of the movie that really comes up trumps is the score which I hate to love.I felt quite enchanted by the arcadian green hill zone that is the shire. But after leaving the shire, it quickly turns into a bit of a chore to watch. They really hammer you over the head with the idea that what's happening is a big deal. It's very tell not show. Our main character is this little guy called Frodo and to me he is just an empty shell. He is the protagonist and he just does what the plot needs him too. If it had been the Same and Gimbly show, then we would have had something. They try desperately to have enough personality for the whole movie but sadly don't manage it.The obnoxious hero worship of the Elves quickly grows irksome. Apparently Tolkien was very anti-racist, but fascist undertones just run through this whole thing with the only enemy (and they do say ""enemy"" out loud a lot) being the external ones.That elf lady when Frodo offers her the ring...it's just laughable. Bakshi interpreted it so much better.Over all this film just has a...mundanity about it. The green-yellow-brown color scheme in the poster really convey the tone; more like a school trip to a museum. With so much conflict going on, I just didn't care.So much needed to be explained better but wasn't. That prologue was well realized but it was so dumb!And the opening monologue:If it had begun ""I HEAR it in the trees"" then it would be a consistent tricolon.Truly this is a story and an adventure on the theme of stories and adventuring and in being so is sadly just an ononistic experience that by now is cliche and deriviative.I will praise Jackson for (mostly) cutting everything that needed to be cut.Shut up, Tom Bombadil!If you aren't into the books...even if you haven't seen this movie, you've seen it in a thousand other things that may not have had the budget but had a lot more heart."
tt0993846,""" The business of America is business "" screams an old clich√© but like so many clich√©s it's based on reality . Is there much difference between a gangster and a stockbroker ? It's the sign of a very poor mobster who can't make a profit for his firm and it's the same with the stock market . Thankfully capitalism is legal and every other socio-economic alternative has been a disaster for humanity but one can't help equating the stock exchange with being the same as gangsterism , supply and demand without any moral or humanitarian mores and one wonders how American auteur Martin Scorsese might bring a story of Wall Street to screen ? If there's a problem with Scorsese he sometimes remakes the same type of film as in THE KING OF COMEDY and BRINGING OUT THE DEAD are remakes of TAXI DRIVER . likewise GOODFELLAS was remade as CASINO .One can't help thinking the temptation to make a story featuring an amoral capitalist could quite easily end up becoming a gangster film set in the world of high finance . "" All my life I wanted to be a white collar criminal ""In effect this is how the film works to a large degree but Scorsese is on top of his game so having such a large similarity on a narrative and visual level with GOODFELLAS and CASINO doesn't matter because for a movie lasting three hours it just flies by . Once again Scorsese uses the directorial technique of intensified continuity which is film critic speak for in your face direction . All the Scorsese hallmarks are here , breaking down the figurative fourth wall , garish and glossy cinematography , constant camera movement , pumping intrusive music etc etc . It's all here and you've seen it all before but it's so well done that none of this matters and remains totally compelling as once again the master director brings us Shakespearean tragedy in its most American and cinematic formTo be fair to Jordan Belfort he didn't torture or kill anybody and his methods of gaining economic profit only differs from the rest of the finance sector in that they're illegal . Actually in amongst the excess of drugs , sex and foul language the storytelling doesn't make a very good job in telling the audience the difference between legal and illegal stockbroking but we're asked to take on board that Belfort isn't that bad because he's played by DiCaprio . Fair enough and he does a good job as a shallow and greedy boy who seduces stupid greedy people in handing over their cash . The rest of the cast also go along with the loud colourful style of the movie but was I puzzled by the one scene cameo by Mathew McConaughey in a pivotal role and kept expecting his character to make a reappearance at some point in the film which doesn't happen . . it'll be very ironic if as I expect McConaughey beats DiCaprio to the Oscar this year . A British audience might also find the casting of Joanna Lumley distracting in much the same way as Ray Winstone in THE DEPARTED , but the cinema audience I watched this with spent much of the running time laughing at the grotesque blackly comical scenes as they played out on screen . Mission accomplished Marty , although one can't help thinking an inclusion of a scene where Belfort passes a card warning a colleague about something is trying a little bit too hard to paint Belfort in a better light than he deserves . I mean it's not like anyone would be queuing up to listen to his lecture seminars after seeing this film is it now ?This is one of the better films from the long , prolific resume of Martin Scorsese , possibly his best since GOODFELLAS but one that will probably be very under rewarded at the prestigious award ceremonies due to one of the strongest film line ups seen in many years . It also won't convert anyone in to being a new found Scorsese fan but for those of us who's enjoyed his familiar language of cinema to tell a story about the American dream turning in to a nightmare it's proof once again that he's Hollywood's greatest living director."
tt0313792,"`Anything Else' is an apt title.  I wish I had gone to see anything else but this movie.  I was bored by the story and irritated by the bad acting and out of control egos.  Jason Biggs was horrible.  He recited his lines like he was reading a phone book.  There was scant emotion or believability. Christina Ricci was another Hollywood ego gone wild.   Did she write the script parts where she was described as the beautiful, intelligent, sexy actress, over and over?  Her role consisted mostly of complaining and showing off her boobs.  She was just irritating.  If possible I would have turn down the sound when she spoke.  Stockard Channing had a bit part as the irritating mother.  Woody Allen played Woody Allen without the charming wit. Most of the characters were self-centered and complaining losers.  I thought they weren't the least interesting and I can't understand why an audience would consider their stories entertaining.  A recurring joke, (I have to assume it was to be considered funny), was about Jason Biggs' Psychiatrist's lack of comments during his sessions.  How could he comment? What could he say? `You're a boring self-centered little boy who is wasting my time with your petty high-schoolish relationships.'  Don't waste your time.  Go see anything else."
tt0167260,"All I can say is this: I have watched Fellowship about 100 times, Two towers about 40 times and Return of the King 3 times. And I'd say that the number of times I've watched them is directly proportional to how I regard each film.Before I discuss the film itself, let me start by saying that I'm not one of those who dis's this (and all the other LOTR movies) simply because they don't follow verbatim those the horribly written, over-baked novels. To those who think this way, I have this to say: I noticed that JRR seems to have lost patience with writing this trilogy towards the end. You'll notice that fellowship is neat and punchy and two towers is engaging, but drops off in parts. By the time JRR was writing RotK, he must have been absolutely fed up with the whole LOTR because the syntax and language is rough, awkward, rushed in parts; and the author's own interest in winding up the story in style is visibly lacking.My criticism of the film itself is more reserved for the fact that the film-makers clearly attempted to hoodwink the population into thinking that this was a grand epic. Post production was over way the top and many elements were far too sentimental and over-dramatic (epic cinematic devices). If they wanted to create a truly great epic, they should have looked at films like Dances with Wolves where the powerful score, grand-standing and sentimentality work seamlessly with the story. For some reason, I felt that this film had all the elements of an epic.... but it just wasn't one. Perhaps the underlying novel didn't give them enough to work with. In any case, it really doesn't rank highly in my humble opinion. Fellowship was, without a doubt, the best of this series. How RotK ended up with all the awards and praise, both here and from the critics, has me absolutely stumped!Sometimes, I get the feeling that everyone was waiting for the final chapter before showering with awards and praise ... and when they finally saw it and realised that it wasn't as great as they had hoped, they were either sucked in by the epic devices (as opposed to an epic MOVIE) or they felt obliged to simply reward it notwithstanding because they had held off their showering of praise on the first two and felt obliged to give one of them all the accolades simply out of respect for their dedication in executing a task this size. Yet... the final product is unsatisfactory."
tt0109830,"*** Momma used to say if you haven't seen this movie, skip the second paragraph, 'cause it's got some of 'dem magic spoilers ***Maybe my inner cynic finally got to me. I've seen ""Forrest Gump"" about seven or eight times altogether, and these last few viewing experiences left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.A few years ago I praised this film for being delightful, warm, inspiring, epic, etc. It was one of my top-ten favorite films. I loved it.I watched it again last night and was struck by how smug, contrived and self-conscious it is. It's almost sickeningly sweet - it's a fantasy (as I've always said) and all the characters live their lives to suit the story. I loved the poetic justice before - now it's kind of insulting.The character of Jenny is, story-wise, a nice addition because all fairy tales have the hero and his girl. The setup is firm because it presents her as the only girl of Forrest's life, the one person who accepts him for who he is - as she grows up and changes he's always there for her. The ending is a nice full circle. But the fact that the film kills her off is too righteous. It's like, ""Hey, she did the sex, she did the drugs - SHE DIES! Who cares if she had a change of heart? She's a filthy skank!"" Forrest's ""Momma"" is a right-wing Christian fanatical who has an obsessive hold over Forrest. She's a bit like the mother in ""Bubble Boy,"" except in this films she's presented as a hero.And finally we come to Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump. Last year I thought it was one of the all-time best performances in any film. Now, I can barely stand listening to him.It's all so smug and annoyingly sweet. ""Would you like a choc'-uh-lut?"" You feel like slapping the guy. Then taking his darn ""walkin' shoes"" and throwing them in a pool of gasoline and lighting them on fire. Along with his box of chocolates.Forrest's smug attitude is a bit too self-knowing for my tastes. It's like he's saying a big screw-you to all the people who disagree. He's Uncle Sam's Favorite American - the dumb guy who was too stoo-pid to say no to the government, and in return was awarded with millions of dollars and a happy, content life. All the Vietnam protesters were pigs, praise America.As far as ""retard"" characters go, Dustin Hoffman is still my favorite. Leonardo DiCaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" is really good, too. But Hanks' performance is just a bit too self-confident and mugging - it's too damn innocent and naive.As I said, this used to be one of my very favorite movies. I loved it. It used to move me to tears at times. (Well, almost, anyway.) But I guess I've given my inner cynic too much room to grow - now I see it as a smug, annoying little journey through America's pop culture - with a message at its core that says, ""Don't mess with America - or you'll get the Gump."" America has enough blind love going already."
tt0120815,"I've just seen Saving Private Ryan for the first time and, as occurs when I first see a film, I quickly check IMDb to see what the Haters and Lovers of the movie say in their reviews.First, the Haters.Any time any movie portrays America as savior of Europe in World War II, the result gets panned by these groups (and if they're not yet organized, they should be as they deserve each other): (1) America haters from any country, notably (a) Germany (""we weren't ALL bad"") or (b) the UK (""we carried the burden until the tardy self-interested Yanks decided to enter war, which by the way was almost won when the US came in""), and (2) hard leftists everywhere (how the left is anywhere entitled to credibility is utterly beyond me).Hey Germany! You WERE bad! Hitler was constitutionally elected and brought to power by the German electorate, only too happy to see the Jew (and the occasional Bolshevik) blamed for everything afflicting Weimar Germany.Hey UK! We love you, but sometimes your hard right and hard left are hard to stomach. Pssst! You, our British cousins, had LOST the war by 1941. It was over, ended, caput, stick-a-fork-in-em done. Winston well knew how critical it was that America enter the war - which it did, and which it won.We are delighted that winning the war was largely an effort of the English-speaking world, but it was the English-speaking world's largest country that led the way, turned the tide and won the war. Stop with the idiosyncratic reasons why, exactly, the US simply joined an already successful enterprise. She didn't. Britain was sunk and defeated, with precious little industrial capacity left - industrial might had to come from the US and Canada, but mostly the US.Saving Private Ryan isn't ""propaganda"" - it contains critical truths, and sometimes truth makes for excellent propaganda."
tt0172495,"I was sooo hyped to see this movie. You have no idea. But my God, it wasnt just bad, it was awful. I'm sitting here staring at the glowing Entertaintment Weekly review and I just cant believe it. Other reviews for the most part are just as good. Did everybody else go to a different movie then I did? Did they not see an overlong bore? Did they not see the maybe 2 or so facial expressions Russel Crowe used in the movie that is supposed to be good acting? Did they not see the action scenes that were put in fast motion and slow motion that were completely unneeded, unartistic, and unoriginal? I wonder if Ridley Scott could have ripped off Spielberg a little more? And the dialogue! Did I hear the young emperor say, ""Im very vexed, terrible vexed!"" I laughed out loud. Was that supposed to be that funny? Or was that just horrifically bad writing? And how about those lovely computer generated lions? Complete trash. How can you people be giving this movie 10's and sending it into the top 100 already. Let there be a backlash please. Movies this bad deserve one."
tt0993846,"The subject of the film is a tawdry fellow whose antics earned him substantial wealth and a lavish lifestyle for a time but his adventures are not interesting enough to sustain a film of any length and certainly not one that runs for three hours. About a half hour in, I lost interest in the shallow and manic characters and their clearly foreshadowed repetitive and unfunny trajectories. The sex, drugs and moral shallowness quickly turned to boredom and the minutes passed slowly. The only relief came as the credits started to roll! What was Mr. Scorsese thinking? Wolf is a dud on almost all counts and I now understand why it earned a relatively rare C CinemaScore. Word of mouth will not keep this in theaters for long."
tt0468569,"When I read the enthusiastic reviews in Italy and I saw this movie ranked 1st in the IMDb's Top 250, I thought: ""It's strange, the other Batman (Begins) was not so brilliant, what's happening with this sequel? Is it really this masterpiece? Is it really in the same league with movies like 'Clockwork Orange' or 'Apocalypse now'?"". No, it's not in the same league. Not at all. When I saw it, my delusion was strong. It's a good blockbuster action movie, but nothing more. Let's see.The following comments contain spoilers. Be careful.The script is not so original. There are tons of action sequences, but¬Ö what can I say? I've seen it all. I've seen the robbery made by violent people, fighting against the guards and killing each others (in all pulp tradition, since ""Reservoir Dogs""). I've seen the ransom in China by plane (""Spy Games""). I've seen those action sequences with cars and armored vehicles in all American movies. (And this Batmobile is really awkward). I've seen the killer who kills by chance (""No Country for Old Men""). I've seen the super-mega-sadistic-mad-chaotic-evil-serial-killer in action who creates dilemmas and plays with his victims (in ""Seven"" and in the ""Saw"" saga). I've seen it all: ""The Dark Knight"" is nothing new. And it's very predictable: you really can predict any sequence before seeing it. There are a lot of absurdities. The heroes could kill The Joleker dozens of times, but they never do it. Why? Are they retarded? The ""two ships dilemma"" (I don't want to reveal more about that scene) is not realistic at all. There are only a couple of surprises, but the 2/3 of the movie doesn't create any suspense. What about the actors? The only two heroes of acting in this movie are Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart. Heath Ledger, with his Joker, bears quite the entire movie. All the other characters became secondary. Aaron Eckhart is really powerful and he confirms his talent shown in ""Thank You for Smoking"". What about the others? Christian Bale is one of the most talented actors of his generation, but in this movie he keeps only one expression all the time, with or without mask. His Batman has no personality. Maggie Gyllenhaal is one of the most interesting (and underrated) independent actresses of the New Hollywood, since ""The Secretary"". But in this movie she can act only in few sequences and she has no chance to show her real talent. Morgan Freeman and Michael Cane are giants, but in this movie they barely appear. Finally: I've never seen so many waste of talent! The good side of the coin in Christopher Nolan's work is: his philosophy. It's really positive and constructive and all his movie is coherent about it. It's just like the positive answer to ""No Country for Old Men"" and to modern nihilism: in the Cohen's movie, Evil is the absence of values and it's unstoppable. In ""The Dark Knight"", Evil is again the absence of values, but it's a minority, not the rule. So, we can fight Evil and defeat it, with or without super-heroes. But all those themes could be and should be explored better. ""The Dark Knight"" explores nothing."
tt0468569,"The Dark Knight actually got lucky. Movies over the last six years have been crap. Scripts poorly written, over budgeted for the visual effect - yet not transferring well to the big screen, bad story ideas, copy cats of other films,lack of creativity, films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making. That's what we've had over the years. Now comes Batman - Dark Knight. Which is written well enough but whose aim isn't good story telling. It's written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end. Why another Batman Joker movie? It's been done already.It has a mindless assembly-line quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the 2 1/2 hours of this film. The scenes are different only by location and a few faces. Something bad happens, the joker appears, Batman appears. Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears. Over and over and over again.The other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark. Like that's a good thing. I don't get it. Maybe because I've had too many real life experiences that were truly dark. Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining. Besides, movies over the last few years are all dark - even the light-hearted ones.This movie made me tired."
tt0114369,"Once an actor has been in a movie with an evil counterculture end and as the bad guy I don't trust movies that actor is in anymore. Kevin Spacey is one such actor. I was half watching Se7en for a long time while I was doing some work on the computer, thinking I wish I knew the remote control was. Near the end I realized that Kevin Spacey was John Doe but he was in jail so I let it go on a little longer. When I heard Morgan Freeman say that John Doe had the upper hand I had to get up fast and change the channel. I still don't know how it ends.There really should be a rating system that a movie has a bad ending so that guys like me don;t get suckered into watching crap like this."
tt0172495,"I went to see Gladiator with low expectations, going only because I have a 1-2 movie a week habit, and there have been few good movies opening in American theaters in recent weeks.  What follows, therefore, is an opinion about one hollywood summer blockbuster movie from someone who admittedly doesn't like such movies in the first place.First of all, Gladiator has the generic faults of most such movies: 1) sophisticated and expensive production design, editing and special effects contrasted with a simple-minded story, stilted dialogue and characters with incomprehensible or unbelievable motivation; and 2) excessive length.  (To be fair, it does not have the very common third flaw, excessive noise.) There are many decent low-budget movies that get by with thin plots and bad dialogue, when directed quickly with some flair; but adding money, big-name (and talented) actors and length makes things worse, not better.I find the violence in Gladiator's battle and fighting sequences very distasteful.  I had the same feeling about Braveheart, although that movie at least balanced its violence with scenes of levity.  I do not object to cartoon violence in movies, and I have never been bothered by anything I saw in John Woo's or other Hong Kong movies.  Graphic scenes of realistic violence do upset me, even more so when (as in this movie or in Braveheart) it is ""righteous"" violence meted out by the hero.Finally, I was disgusted by the movie's misinterpretations of history.  The Roman Senate was an instrument of aristocracy, not democracy.  Commodus was killed by disgruntled servants, and no one thought of replacing him with anything but another emperor.  Having him decide to fight a skilled gladiator is the supreme example of lame screenwriting in this movie."
tt1375666,"It has taken me 9 years to get round to watching this and during that time I looked forward more and more to seeing it.
Was it worth the wait....NO.I find it difficult to find anything positive to say, but the premise and idea of the film is interesting.
That sadly is all, its an overblown mess of a movie with no place for a connection to the films characters.
A collection of choreographed fight scenes connected by dream science mumbo jumbo and accompanied by a bombastic score does not make an interesting movie.
Mr Nolan should have spent his time focusing on a coherent story and some character development, less time on trying to shoehorn in pointless action.A bitter dissapointment of a movie."
tt0133093,"I first saw The Matrix when I was 10 and absolutly loved it. After 6 more years and several rewatches my opinion of the film had dropped several steps.Positivs:
The action is great with fantastic choriography.The effects (mostly) hold up and look great.Hugo Weaving is very intimidating and scary as agent Smith.The first act is extreamly suspensful and builds up a great mystery.The idea behind the story is great even though the execution has several faults.Negativs:
Keanu Reeves is very bad in the movie. He seems like a great guy but most of his acting (except John Wick) is bad.The romantic ""subplot"" doesnt work at all and has almost no buildupSome things make no sense like being shot in the Matrix makes you bleed for real(?) and ""you cant be dead because I love you""(???). Also how can the agents not find NEO in the begining. Why not just go to his pod in the real world and locate him or just kill him if that is impossible. Also why isnt body disposal guarded? It seems that is the best place for the resistence to fill their ranks.The science doesnt work either. Humans cant generate more elektricity than would be needed to keep them alive.Conclusion:
This is a great movie if you want a good time, the action is great and the story is intreaging. But I dont find it some masterpiece. There are plenty of plotholes and some horrible acting from the leads. If you want to watch a similar movie without most of the bad stuff I recomend Dark City. It came out a year earlier than the Matrix and is criminaly underrated."
tt1375666,"easily one of the worst films ever made, that some critics fell for it, just shows how bad today's professional critics have become. no doubt all the 14 to 18 year old Nolan fan boys are going to attack all of us, that have seen through this psycho babble non sense. ultimately the worst thing about the film is that it was utterly boring, from start to finish. at no time to you feel anything for any characters, the dialogue is of such a juvenile nature he must have got a 14 year old to write it. the guy has no idea of what dreams are what takes place during them, i will not go into any philosophical or psychological discussion here as the film does not warrant them, giving there is no sense in anything that is said or done. like dark knight this will have its time in the sun and in a few years the very same people who raved about it will wonder why. as for the ending with the top still spinning telling the audience that anyway it was all still a dream, totally makes the whole exercise futile. shame that a once good film maker has gone right up his proverbial"
tt0120815,"Saving Private Ryan , a film related to World War II, directed by Spielberg, received critical acclaim upon screening. The upsurge of Saving Private Ryan is not only because it is realistic visual impact, what is more important, this film led to an argument about lives.
During World War II, the U.S. and U.K. army landed in Normandy on June 6, 1944. To insure the victory, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), and his troops --101st Airborne Division, are airdropped behind the German front-lines. Unfortunately, all his three brothers were killed in action at the same time. In order to prevent the unfortunate mother from losing all her four sons, the U.S. command decided to send a special squad to look for James Ryan and take him back safely.
John Miller (Tom Hanks) was chosen as the caption of the rescue squad. He hurried to pick several excellent soldiers and a staff officer who could speak German and French as the squad members. When other soldiers were resting, Miller's eight-member squad began to look for Ryan, who was in the unknown area controlled by Germans.
When facing all kinds of dangers and death of teammates one by one, the squad members gradually began to doubt the rationality of this task. Is it worthy of saving one soldier at the risk of losing eight soldiers' lives? The journey of salvation tested every member's value of human nature."

tt0816692,"This is without exception one of the dumbest films I have ever sat through. Or perhaps it's a masterpiece and I'm too dumb to understand it? Anyway .....Here are some of the things (the list is not exhaustive) that I could not get my head around.There is a catastrophic failure in most of the crops of the world. And the entire scientific community simply shrugs and says, 'Oh well. Dem's the breaks' and does nothing. Seriously? Apart from that one dude in the 'super secret' NASA compound? Okay then.A super intelligent, super advanced alien civilization has been watching us. They see that the planet is in peril. That more than six thousand million people will die from starvation. So they offer a solution. Not by curing the blight mind. No, that would be far too easy.They construct a wormhole (they being five dimensional creatures 'n' all) close to Saturn ('cos Kubrick had already used Jupiter in 2001). The film makes a big deal about corn being the only viable crop still resisting the blight (cornmash beer anybody) but it's only a matter of time before that too succumbs. So It's a matter of great urgency that the astro-heroes get to the ol' wormhole as quickly as possible.So the far side of the Moon would be a handy place to put it.No, no, noooo.They place the wormhole beside Saturn. So distant from Earth that it takes two years just to fly there.And all the while any poor kids unfortunate enough to be called Dusty are getting the crap beaten out of them at Pharming College. Anybody for cornflakes?Now NASA have already explored the wormhole. They know that it opens into another galaxy, beside a black hole and an assortment of potential new worlds. Because of the proximity of the planets to the black hole, time will be distorted and a couple of hours exploring these new worlds will translate to decades back on Earth. While back on ol' Planet earth the corn crops fail and the dust storms gather pace. So this was the plan?By the super intelligent aliens? Is someone taking the p*ss? There were no planets anywhere that were ... um ... NOT right beside a black hole? Super intelligent? Doh!And so finally, after a number of silly subplots, our hero finally descends onto the event horizon of the black hole (My God! It's full of stars?). And experiences time as a physical construct. But is he shown the origin of the blight that is wiping out the planet so that he might alert the scientific community? Hell no. He is shown his daughter's bedroom on the day that he left on his 'weekend getaway.' We see him getting really upset that his daughter isn't picking up on his STAY ...... STAY! gravity assisted message, even though he should remember that she shouted STAY .... STAY! to him on that day, and he left anyway. Sheesh!And Zimmer's soundtrack? I hadn't heard about the soundtrack request came to him via email, without him ever seeing the movie. Explains a lot really. Presumably the email went something like 'If you produce anything orchestral like Kubrick, you're off the project.' So the soundtrack consisted almost entirely of ponderous bass heavy synth driven (in the cinema where I watched it) piercingly loud quasi classical discordance. Bear in mind that Kubrick chose the pieces by Strauss, etc., to assist him in editing the movie,and then realised that they actually fit perfectly, and so discarded the original soundtrack that he had commissioned.Not Nolan.NoSirreeBob! Email it in, Hans.Who listens to the music anyway? Deeply, deeply disappointing.And I loved Inception!"
tt7286456,"The movie is very well made in almost every way. It details how the joker becomes - the joker. It makes sense that the journey is not a particularly pleasant experience and I guess lots of people can appreciate it. But I did not enjoy watching this movie very much. It was simply too depressing for my taste. And the joker too miserable.I left the cinema with a feeling that I would have been better off not watching it.But hey, that was just my experience."
tt0848228,"If you honestly love one of those heroes (Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man or Thor), this movie is will be a pleasure for you. However, if you want to see The Avengers because of thrilling special effects or tense action, you will be disappointed.First 2/3 of the movie is constant talking and staring at each other followed with clich√© super-hero-type lines and couple of fights between each other. If not R. Downey's Iron Man and his sense of humor it would be a pure pain. I don't know if it was because of too salty popcorns or because of lack of action on the screen, but after an hour of watching it I became really, really bored. I'd bet on the latter, however... :)The last ~1/5 of The Avengers is the battle in NYC. Fight scenes, humour, and CG looks pretty good. However, there is slight feeling that everything was just too easy. In any way you shouldn't search for logic in these type of movies - there isn't any.Bottom line: Good for fans, average for everyone else. But 8.7 - you have to be kidding!"

The movie strays from the book in too many ways, none of which improve the film, so it's 60% of Tolkien's ROTK, which, in my opinion is not enough.  The ending especially felt like an overly sentimental rush-job tear-jerker -- by the end of the movie I couldn't wait to get out of my seat.Perhaps the extended edition of ROTK will fix some of the problems, but I doubt it.Specific Peeves  (**** SPOILERS AHEAD ****)*  Superfluous character: the orc leader who looked like a cross between a melted candle and ""Sloth"" from Goonies (ironically, another Sean Austin movie). *  Saurman written out. *  Battle of Bywater and the scouring of the Shire completely written out - a real shame. *  Eowyn, the ""stern and proud"" shieldmaiden of the House of Eorl -- is portrayed as a character who doesn't know what the f*ck she's gotten into when she meets up with the Black *  Removal of the confrontation between Gandalf and the Black King at the City Gate. *  The portrayal of Denethor as a food-chomping idiot (not even close to the savvy Steward in the book). *  The Denethor rejecting aid from the Rohirrim and (oh boy!) Pippin to the rescue by lighting a signal fire (again, completely deviating from the storyline) *  The nonsense about Arwen getting sick because of Sauron's overwhelming presence. *  The Paths of the Dead - aka Peter Jackson's version of Haunted Mansion -- I half expected Eddy Murphy to show his head.Overall, the more the movie strayed from the book in plot and dialogue, the worse it was.  I don't think JRR Tolkien's turning in his grave, but I do think he is squirming quite a bit."
tt1375666,"Everyone has been telling me how this movie is so complex, so confusing. That you really need to pay attention or you'll get lost.I dosed off in the middle and still knew exactly what was happening.This movie is nothing but a cross between The Matix, Dreamscape, Mission Impossible and about 3 other movies and anime films that have been coming out since the mid 1980's. The ending was the most obvious outcome it could be, you already know he doesn't except the dream version of his wife so she would be gone. But the kids¬Ögetting home to see their faces again, they were the real focus. If you missed that in the beginning then seeing his father-in-law pick him up at the airport should have been the final tip off.Most people I ask about that missed it all; they couldn't even tell which dream was which. I think that's what scares me the most, people think this takes real intelligence to follow.Maybe if your attention deficit¬ÖOh wait I am and I still had no trouble following this over rated boring movie.I gave this movie 4 out of 10 stars for special effects only, for story line and acting I give it only 2 stars"
tt0139414,The only reason I gave this movie a 3 rating is because of the comedy. This movie did have some moments to it that I thought were quite cute. There were even a couple of moments that I found to be laugh out loud hilarous.Other than that the movie was a dud!I'll give it a 3 rating.
tt0372784,"This movie didn't feel a lot like Batman to me. Better than The Dark Knight, a lot better actually. But still not quite Batman. This movie had some good qualities (due to a great director behind the project) such as character study. The performances were nothing to brag about. Bale was actually acceptable in this (unlike TDK), the villains were so-so, the performances were basically average. Nothing groundbreaking, but luckily no cringe-worthy performances either. In the original comics, Batman was supposed to be a great detective, with great villains capable of outsmarting him. in Batman Begins, none of the villains have any real motives, other than committing random acts of terror. If you have dumb villains, the protagonist will most likely adjust to their intelligence, which was the case in Batman Begins. The film was simply devoid of an interesting protagonist, and even more devoid of interesting villains. The action scenes were badly edited, they certainly took away from the enjoyment and made the film look even more like an action film, and even less like Batman. What Batman Begins also lacked was great cinematography and visuals, which was the primary reason this didn't feel like a comic book film at all. Watch Burton's Batman films and you'll see what I mean.Overall, an okay film, but a disappointing Batman film. I guess this is one of those films where I can understand why people loved it, but I am unable to love it or even like it myself. It just didn't appeal to my taste.Moose finds this film worthy of an 8."
tt0109830,I don't get why this movie is so popular. It makes no sense and is not funny. Don't waste your time. I almost shut it off multiple time because it was so annoying and boring. Watch some other popular movie that wont burn ur last brain cells off. And if anyone recommends this movie to u simply say 'i would like to not have to go back to kindergarten' honestly i can't stress this enough. DONT WATCH IT. I mean u can if u want but like that's not the right way to go. THIS IS JUST MY OPINION. But i think that at sometimes it made me giggle but like that was only like 2 time throughout the whole movie that felt like it was 12 hours long.
tt0381429,"Why is that some people just can't empathize with Holden Caufield in ""Catcher in the Rye""? Emotional turmoil couched in sexual exploration is just that: raw emotional vulnerability. If you have never felt exposed and teeter on some kind of emotional edge (I'm not talking about melodramatic teenage angst) then the character Heidi is inaccessible as is this wonderfully poignant film.I have also heard ""Me You and Everyone We Know"" described a ""simple film"". What an inadequate description for two films that take the audience on an exploration of the boundaries between emotional choice and the structures of reality that all of us create. We are all artists in this sense.Just as with those who become hung up on whether Holden's teacher is exploiting Holden, being myopic with incidentals leaves one incapable of understanding the empathy between Stuart and Joe, two characters who share the experience of questioning their sexual orientation, except in this case Stuart is 15 years in further down this path and is able to understand Joe's inner conflict.This is a wonderful Australian film, but unless you can put aside sensibilities dulled by years of cinematic abuse and take a fresh look at the emotional suffering in this sad and poetic film, you just wont get it!"
tt0133093,"I made every effort to be open minded about ""The Matrix."" I put aside such questions as ""Why does Hollywood see Keanu as a cyberpunk? How came everyone is making making a big deal about these fx which you can see in shampoo commercials?"" I can honestly say I gave it every chance. The fact that the creators were trying to create fully developed worldview was admirable, and the movies surprises hadn't yet been revealed.So as the movie rolled, and I got too see one of the worst, most painful movies I have ever seen, I could honestly say it wasn't me. I enjoy scifi and Hong Kong films, enjoy Philip K. Dick, so I was basically the ideal audience for this film.The plot was so full of loopholes, maintaining suspension of disbelief was impossible. Except for one or two supporting cast members, the acting was lifeless, and the action was unsupported by any motivation. The antagonists were far more sympathetic than the protagonists, whose cold-blooded killing sprees did nothing to endear them to me. Finally the washed out lighting and coloring took away a lot of depth from the images.. when someone seems to leap from building to building, if the buildings look collapsed together, it's not that impressive.And the fighting.. when you watch Jet Li or Jackie Chan fight, even when they are obviously assisted by wires, you feel an exhilaration at what they are physically capable of doing. The fights flow, and the character is maintained through out. In The Matirx, there is no real joy or sense of exertion. People punch each other, pull some interesting feats, but without any sense of risk or accomplishment.What people saw in this waste of film, time and money, I do not know. But I include it with the American remake of Godzilla as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. If you want Phillip K. Dick reality warping, see Blade Runner. If you want good cyberpunk anime, see Akira or Ghost in The Shell, or for martial arts, a good Bruce Lee or Hong Kong flick.But don't waste your time on this."
tt1345836,"Rewatch. I rated The Dark Knight Rises (2012) 5/10. This just dosnt hold up. It's way all over the place & is just poorly written with tons of illogical plot points. It does have some decent action & good cinematography, but it can't save a shambling film.Considering this is Nolan's ""worst"" movie, he has still had an amazing career run as a director."
tt0848228,"My message is to vote this film down. This isn't a 8.8 film. I tried so hard to like it and then I realized it was just another blockbuster.Felt like the transformers with a similar end world feel but at least Mr Bay had the decency to bring to life a sense of need as the impending doom looms.Everything was handled in a nonchalant fashion. Sure the Hulk did provide us with entertainment smash smash and that assistant who was playing games was also funny and it didn't feel contrived but for the .....THIS is not as GOOD as:City of God, Goodfellas, Memento, Se7en, The Usual Suspects, The Silence of the Lambs, American Beauty, Forrest Gump LOTR 1-3, L√©on: The Professional etcVOTE IT DOWN | VOTE IT DOWN | VOTE IT DOWN 7.8 - 8.1!!"
tt0120737,"I can't believe it. Why is this movie on the top 250 list....Things that are bad:1. The script was ""stolen"" from the unbearable 1978s Cartoon which was oversimplified and much too hasty. There is no room for the viewers own imagination, which makes the world feel small and one dimensional.2. The Hobbit world looks like it was made of plastic. You get a ""Tele-Tubbie Land"" impression. The Elven-""Empire"" looks humid, gloomy and creepy. In the book it is exactly the opposite. The CGI looks fake and unrealistic.2a. The Hobbits seem to change their size again and again.4. Most Characters are awfully miscast. Gandalf is too ""soft"". He should at least be a little bit scary. Frodo obviously suffers from thyrotoxicosis and lacrimal hyper-function (his wet eyes seem to pop out every second) Sam is okay. The other two hobbits just suck. Shouldn't the elves be beautiful? Never seen so many ugly elves.(particularly with regard to Galadriel and her husband -- arg) Arven - completely unnecessary. Bilbo looks like a retired serial killer. Where is Tom Bomardil? Boromir looks like a junkie, not like a warrior. Orlando Bloom as Legolas has obviously no acting skills at all. .... There is much more ...Its an awful uninspired movie and will prevent future generations from developing their own imagination of LOTR. (wich is the only exciting point of reading fantasy literature )."
tt0372784,"This one is too realistic for me. I prefer Tim Burton's more fairytale feel Batman films. Burton strikes the perfect balance between real and fantasy, taking the viewer to another world- but one that feels true. This, by contrast, was so dark and gritty as to feel no different than a regular real-world crime drama- with the only difference being a guy in a bat suit."
tt0313792,"How do I begin to describe this movie ? Well, I think the best comparison I can make is that it's sort of like light beer. Please allow me to explain. You see light beer has fewer calories, and is drunk by folks who are trying to lose weight. However, these same folks usually drink double the amount, or more. Thus, eliminating the word ""light"" from the pure definition. This movie is basically the same thing, good thought and intention, only to be overwhelmed with no true logic. That doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy this movie, because I did - very much actually. It just seems to me that all of the most recent Woody Allen movies are pretty much the same film, only the wardrobes of the era change.I thought Christina Ricci was at her best in this film as well as Jason Biggs. They were both solid in their roles. On a scale of 1-10, I give this movie 8 pairs of those Woody Allen retro eyeglasses. See this film, you will enjoy it, but remember this is a Woody Allen movie - Don't say I didn't warn you."
tt0133093,"Special-effects were the drawing card when this came out at the end of the 20th century, and those effects were spectacular. They lived up to their billing.Unfortunately, the story was a bit confusing for much of the two hours, a bit too secular-minded for me, although others have viewed this with Biblical analogies. I do think the script could have used some humor here and there. It took itself a little too seriously. That was especially true for the four main characters.Nonetheless, because of the stylish visuals and effects, it entertained. I liked the monotone-speaking Hugo Weaver the best, or at least found him the most interesting. Lawrence Fishburne's character came in a close second in that regard.Once again here's a movie that made you glad VHS tapes were being phased out in favor of sharper, widescreen transfers."
tt7286456,I like Joakin Phoenix but his performance wasn't Oscar worth like Heath Ledger! The movie wasn't bad and the acting wasn't bad but this writer turned this into a slow joke with this music! I can see why people got upset about the mental ill aspect of this movie but a person with a mental illness pushed to the edge! It didn't stink but it could've been better and I wish it had been!
tt0108052,"This movie really made you feel for the people who were involved in this terrible ordeal.  I wouldn't consider it to be one of favorite movies of all time, but mainly this is because it isn't my favorite type of movie.  As a documentary I think it is superb and I highly recommend that others see it so that they too can see some of the atrocities that this world has seen and so we can make sure that this never happens again."
tt0102926,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a disturbing and unsettling film that often crosses the line into gratuitous violence and gore. Directed by Jonathan Demme, this psychological thriller attempts to delve into the minds of serial killers and their captors, but it ultimately falls short of delivering a satisfying and meaningful narrative.The movie relies heavily on shock value, using graphic imagery and disturbing scenes to manipulate the audience's emotions. While some may argue that such elements are necessary to convey the horror of the crimes depicted, it often feels like the film is more interested in sensationalism than in telling a compelling story.Furthermore, the characters in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" are shallow and one-dimensional. Hannibal Lecter, played by Anthony Hopkins, is often praised for his chilling performance, but his character is reduced to a mere caricature of a brilliant but deranged killer. Similarly, Clarice Starling, portrayed by Jodie Foster, lacks depth and development, making it difficult for the audience to truly connect with her struggles.The film's pacing is another major issue, as it struggles to maintain a consistent rhythm. The plot frequently drags, weighed down by lengthy dialogue scenes that are more interested in shock value than in advancing the story. This leads to a disjointed viewing experience that fails to engage the audience on a meaningful level.While ""The Silence of the Lambs"" may have been groundbreaking in its portrayal of a female FBI agent and its exploration of psychological horror, it ultimately fails to live up to its reputation. Its reliance on shock and gore overshadows any potential depth, leaving the audience with a feeling of discomfort and unease rather than genuine intrigue or reflection.In conclusion, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a film that aims to shock and disturb, but it sacrifices meaningful storytelling and character development in the process. Its gratuitous violence and lack of genuine depth make it a disappointing and forgettable entry in the thriller genre."
tt0137523,A woman needs to speak up for Helena Bonham Carter's incredible acting performance in this movie. Because it's guys who post for the film she's been overlooked because no man can relate to how anti-female this woman is and how far from the real Helena. Women who can treat random sex and despicable grunge as a natural and casual form of life have gone off the path somewhere and this girl isn't looking for redemption. She embraces the strange as normal and rejects the comfortable and pretty as the aberrations. Few other actresses could have achieved the level of intense hyperactivity and abandon Helena captures here. So much so that she sinks into the movie like a dead body into a sewer and has been ignored on these boards thus far.
tt0167261,"I may be committing cinema heresy here, but I have complaints about the second Lord of the Rings film, The Two Towers. Number One: It is excessively long. I know the books that the movie is based on is really really long, and for a book, that's a good thing. When someone is reading a good book, they never want to put it down, they want to be with Frodo and Sam forever as they dodge ring raiders and enter Mordor, the home of Mt. Doom where the ring must finally end up. However, for a movie, it's tough to sit through a 3 hour plus movie, especially one that consists of nearly one hour of fighting between the good guys and the bad guys. What I personally find fascinating with the Lord of the Rings, the mythology of the ring and how the different characters are allowed to act within the rules of the Middle Earth universe, is there, but is pushed aside in favor of a dark, muddy fight. That leads to Complaint Number Two: There are too many characters for non-die hards to keep track of. Perhaps these two complaints come from the fact that my attention span is not as good as it used to be. Now the good: Gollum makes Jar-Jar Binks looks like a Simpsons' cartoon character. The combination of stop-action and CGI animation, Gollum the whithered hobbit looks totally believable and is the most interesting character in the saga, I think. What happened to him? Will the same thing happen to Frodo? These are questions I had that were spurred on by watching the Two Towers. The walking, talking trees are also a triumph in technology, something like this could not happen just a few years ago. The Empire Strikes Back is the best of the 3 Star Wars films, I think The Two Towers is the weakest of the Lord of the Rings films, so there is no definitive word on whether the middle chapter of trilogy suffers or gains compared to the surrounding chapters. It is not a bad film, again it looks great, has interesting characters, but I just wish some fat was trimmed off the film. I know die-hards would have a fit, but the length does keep some casual movie go-ers away, and there is plenty, especially in the end fight scene, to be taken away. But Peter Jackson has a houseful of Oscars, and I don't, so what do I know?"
tt0133093,"I have never fallen asleep at the cinema, but The Matrix is the closest I've ever come to doing so.  Quite frankly, the first hour of this film is the most boring hour of film ever.Keanu Reeves cannot act, neither can Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Ann Moss doesn't do much better.  The whole thing is too dark, and let's be honest: If you've seen the trailer, you don't need to see the film, as it shows you all the special effects there anyway.I've been more disappointed by other films, but I fail to see how this uninspiring and badly acted mess is hailed so much by fans.  Any old fool can string together a series of special effects, the trick is to link them with a good story and enjoyable characters.  The Matrix does neither.I'll admit it picks up a bit in the second half, but I was so completely and utterly appalled by the first hour, no amount of bullet time, however impressive, can save this film.My Rating: 4/10"
tt0111161,"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"".The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want."
tt0111161,Don't want to say any words about this film. Just a perfect 10.
tt0137523,"*Spoiler I guess*  Violent film about manly therapy through secret fight club has good start, intriguing premise and sharp actors but founders about Round 6 and ultimately is out on a TKO.  The wrap up is about as plain stupid as it gets and essentially invalidates everything before it.  I don't mean to be harsh, but who the heck is voting on these movies on Imdb?  If this is really in the top 40 movies of all time then I'm Harry Houdini."
tt0110912,"This is ofcourse a classical iconic picture that has spread around the world.I have heard people say its the greatest movie ever and that i need to see it. I strongly disagree. Its very overrated.Pulp fiction is a bad movie. Filmning is raw, but done good. The acting is pretty good. But otherwise it has got a bad storyline. The story is not something you get attached to, although the whole story comes together at the end of the movie (which I often appreciate in movies) I also appreciate sometimes when films jump into different time sequences that slowly lead to an end. I think Pulp Fiction fails at this, as it instead makes you easily confused at certain scenes. The humor is okay, but not anything that stands out aswell, the scriptwriting is good, wide and deep tho. To summarise: A pretty wierd film.I wouldnt recommend it, even tho the big influence it and still is spreading."
tt0068646,It's a movie from which I have learned many things about life.
tt0172495,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a film that is acted and directed very well, but is an eyesore to look at for two and a half hours. The film's effects are nice, which got the film an Oscar in 2000, and so are the costumes, but they are all captured in a dirty, muddy tone. Most of the film is a dingy colored brown, appearing as if someone imbedded dirty in the camera lens.The film's plot is just a revenge story, soaked within a period piece. It involves General Maximus Decimus Meridius (Crowe), the leader of the Roman Army in AD 180. Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Harris) is very pleased with his latest victory, and grants him leadership, much to the dismay of the Emperor's son, Commodus (Phoenix). It isn't long before Commodus is consumed with rage, and murders his father, claiming the throne as his.Commodus puts out an order to the Praetorian men to kill Maximus's wife and son. Before Maximus can return in time to stop them, they are killed. Being in a functioning state of depression, and after being kidnapped by slaves who teach him how to fight, Maximus finds out he has a knack for fighting and slaying people. So the plot is born. Maximus is a great gladiator, and continues to fight and murder, leading up to his appearance at the Roman Colosseum.I've established that the film is long, which it is, but it is also fairly impotent. It's slow, a bit dreary, yet well written in the sense that decent dialog is always recited. After a while, though, you begin to grow weary of the film's hushed tone, and about five battle scenes later, the material begins to overstay its welcome.The film is slowly paced, but it definitely has a grand appeal. Crowe's performance is fantastic, and he brings life to a new action hero. For the brief time we see him, Richard Harris does a fantastic Emperor, and Joaquin Phoenix does an outstanding job playing a despicable, intolerable villain.I also stated that the film's costumes are nice, which they are, but after two hours they become sort of a chore to stare at. Some nice CGI is used, some scenes made up entirely of it, yet again, everything looks the same. Everything is mostly brown, green, and black, and very monotonous and harmful on the eyes.Not to mention, no characters are really developed at all. The film is two and a half hours, and neglects to give us very many personal traits of the characters. This is the perfect case of style over substance; a movie trait I've run into far too much recently. To value style over substance is to put looks in front of every other concern, rather than efficiency and depth. John Logan, one of the three writers of this film, would give us so many character traits of Howard Hughes in The Aviator, four years later. It's a shame that wasn't put in the foreground rather than a loud score and heavy action sequences with this.Gladiator isn't perfect, but it's a fairly memorable action flick, with some ups and downs. To me, this seems like a long B movie, with marvelous special effects and well known actors. It's just a shame that in two and a half hours we have to listen to decent, yet sometimes, redundant dialog, trait-less characters, and stare into a vast field of brown. At least we get Oscar worthy performances to watch for the most part.Starring: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou, Ralf M√∂ller, and Richard Harris. Directed by: Ridley Scott."
tt1375666,"I have to say to make such an impressive trailer and such an uninteresting film, takes some doing.Here you have most of the elements that would make a very good film. You have great special effects, a sci-fi conundrum, beautiful visuals and good sound. Yet the most important part of the film is missing. There is no plot, character or soul to this film. It's like having a beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside.It's an empty shell of a film. There is no tension; you couldn't care less about any of the characters, why were they even motivated to do what they did. Helping a corporation get ""one over"" on another corporation is hardly saving the human race.When you operate in a dream environment, where you can't die or be injured really it means there is nothing to worry about, who cares what happens. All the explosions and actions sequences are just meaningless. By the way, why does Hollywood still keep filming action scene's an inch away from every characters nose? It's impossible to see what's going on, so many films are ruined by this. Watch and learn from the Matrix, take the camera backwards a couple of feet and we can actually work out what's going on.So 2 and half hours of looking at my watch waiting for the very predictable ending, is a million miles from being a good film. How anyone in their right mind can give this 10/10, it's boring and pointless. A film has stir the soul, has to grab you, you need to feel for the characters. Can anyone, honestly say, they cared about anyone on show here.By the way, here's an idea, why don't you bring the children (who haven't aged a minutes since you last saw them) to you, if you can't go to the US.I know the end scene was trying to be ambiguous, but the fact his father, who lives in Paris, is bizarrely there in the US to meet him (how did he know) and the children look identical to every dream sequence they appeared in, means there wasn't much doubt.In the end there is nothing at stake for anyone, so a pointless movie. I suspect Nolan will continue to get praise, but I can't really say I've got excited about any of his movies. They all leave me cold. They are not terrible, just there's nothing really there, no substance."
tt1853728,"OK OK How good is Django really? I am a real Quinton fan. this movie is good to watch if you if you know his style. It has a message of redemption and empowerment. I like seeing Jamie Fox and other ethnic actors getting top roles. As far as original, this effort is dull. He borrowed the success of Hans Lander from Inglorious. Samuel Jackson's role is just another movie for him to be in. As far as using slavery as a plot i would rather see more serious depictions in movies that enlighten us and drive us to improve our outlook toward a better future. The difference between Inglorious Basterds and this movie is that we do not have a race of people that we still have a derogatory word that is harming us as people. The N word is old in Quinton's movies and why do we still use it to make millions at the box office. Not really a great movie. Lets see if Quinton has it in him to do a movie without needing two hours of the N word."
tt0429078,"Well the story is told kind of fast, as you can see in the summary, but who watches a martial-arts-action movie because of the story? The fights are choreographed excellent and the visual effects are some of the best in the genre. Of course the movie doesn't reach the state of a ""Hero"" or a ""House of flying daggers"", but in my opinion this and ""The Seven Swords"" are two different types of martial-arts in any way. This movie is more based on the action sequences and not on the aesthetic aspect of the martial-arts. Well, who knows Tsui Harks works and likes movies like ""Iron Monkey"" and ""Once Upon A Time In China"", as well as movies like ""Hero"" and ""House Of Flying Daggers"" knows what he has got on this jewel of the genre. It's a mixture of both ""Hero"" and ""Iron Monkey"". The only negative aspect is that the Seven Swords and their bearers are introduced much too short. They appear too sudden and it's hard to follow their story, but while the movie goes on it becomes clearer and clearer which character is bearing which sword and what's his role in the movie. In any way this movie is one of the best five movies in this genre."
tt1375666,"Well, it's of course not 1 out of 10, more like 4, but in the light of current rating 9 out of 10 and climbing I'd give it a negative number. Please, please, please ignore its IMDb rating - it's becoming more and more meaningless. The idea for the plot is actually pretty interesting and some scenes are original but that's pretty much it. Each and every character is one-dimensional and shallow, the political setting is such a clich√© and ending is easily predictable. There is a lot of stupid and unneeded chasing and shooting, punching and kicking, very much like in cheap Chinese movies. Which is fine in itself if all that you expect is an action movie, but if you expect something more memorable, then just skip it in theatres and rent a DVD in a few months. While watching such movies there is feeling that it's made like a puzzle from predefined pieces. Each piece was seen million of times before and the whole does not add anything on its own. I wholeheartedly agree that shooting a movie is not easy, and nobody can probably generate enough fresh ideas to produce a masterpiece each time. This time Nolan produced a mediocre result, let's wish him next time to make less primitive and more interesting show."
tt7286456,This movie is poorly done as to how it tells the story. It is a dark movie showing the problem of mental illness
tt7286456,"It's a beautifully made movie. It's a different take on the Joker origin story. The acting is some of the best I've seen. Stop comparing it to Nolan's Joker, that is not what this is. It's not a action pact superhero film it's a character study of a different type of Joker. If anything it's a more realistic look of how Gotham really is depicted."
tt1345836,"This elongated chaotic murk is studded with stars, but they shed no light. I could tell there was a bad guy, but I couldn't figure out how he managed to breathe. The good guy seemed to be the Batman, but he was too willowy and wispy, and during his frequent bouts of fisticuffs with the bad guy he always got the worst of it. At one point I thought the plot was vaguely modelled on the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. But only vaguely. It would possibly have been helpful to know how the several other stars had been designed to fit in to this benighted epic. I think we should have been told. But I couldn't make it out. My fault, no doubt. After a few hours of bafflement, the scene was suddenly flooded with light, and civilization was saved. The question remained: Had it been worth it ? Not really. This film, bought on a mistaken whim thinking it came in at number 4 on the all-time list, has firmly warned me off any others featuring the legendary Batman. Give me Dracula, any day."
tt1375666,"Christopher Nolan is the 21st century's leading cinematic show-off. His 2010 movie Inception is a marvel of visual ingenuity and multi-tiered storytelling. Even as I watched this film for the first time, ten years after its creation, there was no denying he'd pulled off a very original, sumptuous film that sets a different standard for filmmaking in the new millennium. I was impressed. I was interested. But I was never really involved. Concerned that I may have been too obtuse to have taken in this film properly, I set out to learn a bit more about Nolan and Inception. From Wikipedia, I learned that ""Nolan's films are typically rooted in epistemological and metaphysical themes, exploring human morality, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity."" Wow. If I hadn't dropped out of my first year philosophy course, I might have been better able to enjoy this film. At least I wouldn't have had to look up epistemological (""having to do with the theory of knowledge,"" in case you were wondering). Okay, so I guess Inception may be all of those things, but as The New Yorker's David Denby points out in his review of the film, ""There's no spiritual meaning or social resonance to any of this"" (New Yorker July 26, 2010 issue). I couldn't have said it any better.
In case you haven't seen it already, Inception traces the story of Dominic Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio). He has a nifty job title: extractor. That means he craftily enters people's subconscious minds through a shared dream that his victims do not know is shared, and steals sensitive information to help the people who hire him become really rich and really powerful. Nice guy! Also, he is in exile. He sorely misses his young son and daughter, whose mirages we see many times throughout the movie, but only from behind, never glimpsing their faces. Poor Dom can not be reunited with his children in America because he is a wanted man there, accused of the murder of his wife Mal. Is the charge justified? This is one of the questions the film explores.
It's difficult to summarize the movie's labyrinthine plot in a review of this length. Suffice it to say, Dominic is sort of like Odysseus. He just wants to get home to his family but he is stalled in a dangerous voyage of his own undertaking, having to fight battles and outsmart unexpected adversaries in his latest victim's unconscious mind. Doing so will secure a safe passage to the U.S., provided as payment by his latest employer Saito (Ken Watanabe), a greedy Japanese energy tycoon. Instead of adventures on the high seas, Dominic's adventures take place in a multi-layered dreamworld. His mission this time is a little different. Instead of extracting information he must plant an idea in his wealthy target's mind. That's called ""inception."" If successful, this will make his already super rich employer Saito become obscenely rich (what a great cause!). In order to build this maze-like dreamworld, making it safe and impervious to invasion from unwanted forces such as the lingering ghost of Mal (like in malware--get it?), he enlists the aid of a really smart young lady. In keeping with Nolan's habit of giving his female characters stupidly obvious names, he calls her Ariadne (Ellen Page), a reference to the mythical Greek daughter of King Minos who helped Theseus escape the maze of the man-eating Minotaur to whom he was sacrificed. I believe this is what we call ""intertextual"" storytelling. It's meant to enrich the meaning of the story by drawing in archetypal stories and themes to add depth. One would expect nothing less from Nolan, the grandiose showman of cinema. Well done Nolan! You are very smart.
THE ONE THING that disappoints the most about this film is that, even though the film transpires mostly in people's dreams, there is very little that is dreamlike about them. Instead, the dream landscapes are there to accommodate a handful of action movie setpieces. They are visually stunning setpieces to be sure. In particular, the gravity defying fight scene in a hotel corridor, in which people's bodies are pulled toward constantly shifting centers of gravity, to match a parallel tumble off a bridge in which the bodies of the sleeping dreamers within the dream are plummeting through space in a van. It is a remarkable achievement. However, it is not the stuff of dreams. Dreams are eery and psychologically unsettling. They express buried fears and longings while hinting at the existence of awe-inspiring supernatural forces. And quite often, the locations are spare and minimal. Great filmmakers like Federico Fellini and David Lynch filmed dream sequences that left viewers with gooseflesh, and they did so by fiddling with combinations of settings and sounds usually in spare surroundings. They did so by tugging at the viewer's empathic sense of kinship with the character, and sparking a commingled sense of attraction and dread to the dream narrative. Films can only achieve this effect of heightened emotion and involvement when there is something at stake, something that the viewer cares about. Regrettably, I didn't care about anybody or any outcome in Inception. Will one multinational corporation surpass the other in wealth? Who cares? Will the morally shady Dominic be reunited with his kids? I don't care that much because he's an emotionally closed character. Will Christopher Nolan tie up all the loose ends in his high tech mental thriller? I suppose he did but, again, I didn't care.
Inception reminds me of another film in which the main character yearns to return home, The Wizard of Oz. But unlike that film, it is all brains and no heart. Nolan needs to find the courage to admit he is wanting as a complete filmmaker and change his game to reflect the maxim that I learned when I entered teacher's college: ""No one cares how much you know until they know how much you care."""
tt0137523,"I don't know how to say, this movie is over-rated as h3ll. I don't really understand how can people still pretend they really likes this.Sleepness guy tries to solve his problem and he mets a soapmaker?! What is this movie about? Making a movie about Anti-Capitalizm but make it with $60M. Yes what a good movie. I don't wait to see Brad Pitt again as a SOAPMAKER.I don't know is there any movie that his nonsense can be over-rated this much. It's just a waste of time.Even he shots himself but only dies the other guy? Why, which action or person is real and which other is not real? Which part of movie is real and which part of movie is playing inside his head?Amazingly nonsense and extremely over-rated."
tt0111161,"My favorite movie was really The Godfather until I saw The Shawshank Redemption.A lot of people would might disagree with, but I love this movie. the actors are great, the director has done a fantastic job and the screenplay is magnificent.I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clich√©d, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.I remember, when i saw the movie I didn't want to get up and go to the toilet. When I finally was done in the bathroom, I couldn't wait to get back and press play on my DVD. At the time I was done with the movie I wanted to see the movie again.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clich√©s and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.So see it, buy it, love it."

tt0133093,"THE MATRIX is a good film , without doubt the greatest film featuring the sub genre of cyberpunk , but it`s film whose reputation is mainly built upon having a very clever premise more than anything else . I remember being absolutely stunned at the revelation of the plot , but  when I saw it for a second time at the weekend on channel 5 ( First time I saw it was about three years ago ) I was slightly bored by the film . It`s by no means a boring film , it`s just that once you know how the plot twists , turns and sometimes boggles the mind the revelations don`t have the same effect second time around . THE MATRIX hasn`t been helped either by the amount of spoofs/rip offs featuring the scenes where the action stops , the frame freezes , the camera turns 360 degrees and then the action starts again . These scenes were jaw dropping at the time but have now been done by countless ads , pop videos and other movies it`s become impossible now to remember the impact this cinematography technique had at the time . I also think the producers of THE MATRIX haven`t done themselves any favours by turning THE MATRIX into a franchiseTo sum up this is a good film . Like me you`ll certainly enjoy it first time you watch it but unlike say MEMENTO ( Note the cast connections between the two movies ? ) THE MATRIX doesn`t reward the audience with repeat viewings and at the end of the day the not too dissimilar TOTAL RECALL is probably a more enjoyable film"
tt0172495,"The beginning of ""Gladiator"" is powerful. We see the Roman Legion fighting against the Germanic tribes in what surely must be one of the most spectacular battle scenes ever filmed; one which truly does give the viewer a taste of what warfare in that era must have been like. The ending is powerful, as the quest for vengeance finally comes to a head, with General Maximus facing the Emperor Commodus in a gladiatorial contest in the Roman arena. In between - well - things could have been a little better.The acting in this movie, I thought, was first-rate. Russell Crowe as General Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Emperor Commodus and Connie Nielsen as Lucilla, sister of Commodus, all played their parts perfectly. The gladiatorial bouts were superbly choreographed. The set decoration was magnificent, and looked exactly as I would expect Imperial Rome to have looked. So, why do I say this could have been better?(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Basically, the whole thing was just a bit too clear-cut for me. Maximus was too obviously the good guy, Commodus too obviously the bad guy. With this being so clear, we know that the movie must be heading for the final confrontation between the two, and it makes watching the middle 90 minutes or so difficult. ""Get on with it,"" I found myself thinking from time to time. It didn't have to be quite so clear cut. The potential was there to give the viewer a real ethical choice to make. I mean, one can understand Commodus being angry when Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) - his father - takes away the throne that Commodus had believed all his life would be his, and hands control of Rome over to Maximus. Commodus could have been a sympathetic character. He didn't have to murder his father. His father was elderly; a natural death wouldn't have been out of the question. And why the incestuous fascination with Lucilla? I didn't think it added anything to the movie - except to make Commodus even more repulsive. In the end, the movie didn't make me think about anything; it didn't challenge me with any moral decision-making; it didn't make choosing sides in this battle even remotely difficult.Don't get me wrong. This was a very good movie. One can always argue whether this movie or that should have been named best picture; one certainly has to agree that ""Gladiator"" was worthy of consideration. I just felt it could have been better. In the end, I give it a rating of 7/10."
tt0102926,"I felt this wasn't as good as I thought it'd be. Amount of stars it got out of ten, I didn't feel it deserved it. I'm not sure what I was expecting but if you're looking for a really shocking thrilling twisted storyline and you put all your hopes on this, don't.. Cause that's what I did. I was hoping for a film where I could be almost taking part in the investigation in the movie, but I felt it wasn't very thrilling or anything. I love a film where the storyline is almost too unique to think of by yourself, and hoped his would be it. But it wasn't. I suppose I hoped for more action, more spookiness I guess we could say. But I didn't feel any shivers up my spine anyway."
tt0816692,"How this travesty of a ""sci-fi"" movie has garnered so many gilded reviews is proof that either A) I am way out of step with the great, unwashed movie-going masses or B) the aforesaid masses have never seen a truly great ""sci-fi"" flick. This movie was interminable; I almost walked out 38 minutes into the run, when Mathew was still just a former test pilot trapped in the body of a corn-huskin' farmer.Which leads me to my first problem with Interstellar: would you ""hire"" a corn-huskin' farmer and devoted Dad of 2 to be the pilot of an intergalactic space mission? Aside from 1 or 2 very brief allusions, there is ZERO explanation / justification for Matt to be selected for this mission. And strangely enough, Michael Caine ages not 1 day in the 23 years since Matt blasts off for ""strange new worlds"".He is still in the same pants and shirt as he was when Matt blasted off (23 years before); the directors did give Mike a wheelchair for good measure. Before I proceed, there were 2 or 3 somewhat interesting plot twists, and the CGI / special FX were very good (just like ""Gravity"", another recent ""sci-fi"" disappointment); although the robot was utterly ridiculous; more like a walkin', talking' 21st century soda machine or a ""Gen 12"" Robbie the Robot.Of course, CGI and special FX alone do not a classic ""sci-fi"" film make. I cannot disclose 2 major plot disappointments due to the ""spoiler"" clause but suffice it to say the powers behind this film have tried to fuse an entry level class in quantum physics with an action film; and it just didn't work.I have now accepted, grudgingly, that for enough money you can get the finest actors to play in the most ludicrous films. Read the cast list; scratch your heads in disbelief, along with me. And if you want a classic ""sci-fi"" movie? Try 2001, Blade Runner, and Alien."
tt0848228,"I find it hard to believe that a film which was mostly made on a computer has such a high average rating. Does anyone care anymore that so little effort and imagination goes into film making? Avengers is 95% CGI, with a plot that is staggering in it's stupidity and unoriginality. Two of the so-called 'super-heroes' have no 'super' qualities at all - unless having funny coloured eyes and firing souped-up arrows or running around in a tight spandex suit showing lots of cleavage and pouting a lot qualify as super powers. All Black Widow does is what Emma Peel did 45 years ago - and half as well, i.e. kick ass. Even worse, the two best and most interesting Marvel characters, Iron Man and Hulk are reduced to mindless morons smashing their way through the enemy and without any attempt at the characterization that previous films did at least endeavour to give them. Every scene and plot twist is utterly predictable, the special effects are boring and the only thing to admire is Samuel L. Jackson'e uncanny ability to find high grossing movie trash to take a stroll through, without making the least effort, and pick up a fat cheque at the other end. Now THAT IS a super power."
tt0468569,"I know people will hate me for giving this movie 2 stars, but allow me to explain why the rating is deserved. I watched this movie twice and my initial impression of it was confirmed on the second viewing. The tagline of the movie is ""Welcome to a world without rules."" But even someone who likes the movie must realize this is absurd, because the rules of the film are strictly defined from the start. Batman is PERFECT GOOD, and the Joker is PERFECT EVIL. Whenever it's the cops versus Batman in this movie, we know the cops are wrong and Batman is on the side of good. He's just that good. And the Joker is so evil that he doesn't even have a motive. He's there to create a force of perfect chaos which Batman is duty-bound to fight.To deny that this movie is about terrorism is to deny the well-executed thrill elements such as the videos released to the press and closed-circle moral tests (on the ferries; similar to United 93). These are borrowed directly from the terrorist playbook, and one persistent element, the ticking time-bomb scenario which Batman solves by brutally beating people up until he gets the information he wants, is derived from our fear of terrorism even though ticking time-bombs NEVER happen in real life. When you compare the movie to reality, though, an outrageous discrepancy is made evident. Terrorists are not born psychopaths like the Joker. They are poor, scared people driven to violence only by persistent reinforcement of hatred and duty. That's WHY there are no ticking time-bombs: true psychopaths do not act like the Joker, and terrorists are not true psychopaths.In this movie, the only mistake Batman makes is when he injures himself swerving his motorcycle so that he doesn't kill the Joker. He is just too good to kill his enemy. Three thousand years of storytellers are laughing themselves to tears in Heaven at our image of a hero. Read Shakespeare. Read the Iliad. See if you can figure out for yourself what kind of travesty this is.The areas where this film deviates from standard superhero crap only condemn it further. Batman creates a magical cell phone network, which his buddy says a violation of privacy; the film makes his buddy out to be a spineless coward, because Batman needs his magic to do good. Do you see the problem here? Here it is: Batman doesn't exist in real life.To call this movie the best film of the year, or, as IMDb currently reckons it, the best film of all time, is to admit that we want to believe in a world where good battles evil. It creates a worldview where ""good"" people will not have to admit their own problems, and ""evil"" people can be rounded up and beaten half to death without any moral qualms. It is EXACTLY this kind of mentality which has caused the war in Iraq, Abu Ghraib, and Guantanamo Bay.I award this movie eight stars for execution, but subtract five stars for its incorrect, dehumanizing, and morally stunted outlook on human nature. Thus, it ends up with three stars, which I think is more than generous."
tt7286456,"""Joker"" is nor a ""masterpiece"" nor is it ""flawless"" as this board boasts. It's mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix's part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlights many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding. Sprinkled in are a few light-hearted moments to remind you that ""hey, the Joker is still funny at times""... But with the strained mental illness angle it's difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit of introspection on what it is and who it is you're laughing at. The real ""danger"" this movie poses is that it's another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling... Which does way more harm than good.There is no great existential pandering, as some are saying... ""it's deep"", ""my feels"", ""It's not a superhero movie it's a character study"", regardless of what anyone wants to categorize it as.. I'll consider it a generous 3."
tt0848228,"Before I went to the movie I was shopping for Tshirts online and found one that looks like the NASCAR symbol...

Anyway, someone made a Tshirt that looks identical but instead of NASCAR it says BORING. Lol.Anyway, flash forward to me falling asleep in the movie, butt numb, and I keep picturing that Tshirt. Boring. This movie. Really boring.I think I fell asleep 3 times, for about 15 minutes total. Its hard to sleep too long because every now and then there is an explosion or some other loud whammo.The Dark Knight was WAY better than this. Spiderman was WAY better than this.Is it worthy of 1 star? No. Maybe it should be 3 or 4... But I'm giving the 1 to help offset some of the insane 10s I'm seeing on here. Seriously, there are people on IMDb saying its the best movie they have ever seen in their life. Really? Really!? Really. O.o I smell something fishy going on around here.The movie was completely vapid, boring, convoluted. Nothing about the movie was new or interesting.I'm assuming the score has been manipulated by social media, hopefully IMDb will do something about it. I look forward to seeing the score drop consistently for years to come, once whoever/whatever is driving this fake voting moves onto a new project."
tt0109830,"Only saved from all-time worst status by a good soundtrack and Tom Hanks' best effort to turn a truly awful character into someone vaguely palatable.This movie is an insult to the audience, its own subject matter and to anyone operating on something higher than basic brain stem function.Oh, look at the funny retard - he's a moron but he has a simple wisdom that can redeem us all.  Fortune cookies are sophisticated when compared to the message of this film.  Ugh.It is a sad commentary on the Academy's milquetoast voting standards that Gump is not the worst film to ever win a Best Picture award."
tt0313792,"Anyone not interested in seeing a morose, persistently pessimistic outlook on life should never see a Woody Allen movie. I have loved almost everything he has done since Annie Hall and have even come to later appreciate the sheer boldness and zaniness of early comedies like Sleeper and Love & Death. What I didn't expect, but should have, was how depressing Allen's movies would become as time wore on.Aside from the funny and charming light comedy Small Time Crooks, the 2000's must have been a bad decade for Woody Allen. His dark worldview is never more prevalent than Anything Else, which follows the relationship between a young, neurotic writer and his unpredictable girlfriend. The story is very reminiscent of a Woody Allen movie from the 1970s like Annie Hall or Manhattan. However, Allen has improved his game by no longer casting himself as the lead role, but here casting the very talented Jason Biggs to play the nervous, conscientious writer who finds himself with a girlfriend so unreliable and bizarre that he has to come up with new tactics everyday to keep up and understand her unusual logic and thinking. Biggs and Christina Ricci are both very good in playing roles Allen and Diane Keaton perfected 30 years prior. Indeed, the whole cast has a real smart edge to them that keeps the audience engaged and on the edge of their seat.There isn't much to say about the rest of the film, other than to see it and be careful before seeing it. Woody Allen, like so many other great directors in cinema history, is an acquired taste. Like Bergman, Kubrick, Welles or Wilder, he is so unique and individualistic in the way he creates characters and situations that it makes perfect sense if someone tells me they don't care for Woody Allen movies. I must confess, his last few films have become so negative and pessimistic in their outlook and message that it makes me feel very depressed. And yet, his films are always interesting. Despite his usual downbeat material, Allen is not without reason and it makes for a very interesting debate and thought-provoking discussion if you can find someone. The message of this film is that life is so inexplicable that so often you cannot even try to explain why and how things happen. Though I wish I could, I cannot disagree with that thinking and it is because of this that I continue to seek out Woody Allen films."
tt0167260,"Firstly, let me get it clear that I have never read Tolkien's books nor do I intend to. As such I don't know how the real story was and what was cut out? The following comments refer only to the movie, as a piece of cinema.There is way too much presumption. The story starts off about a ring that is oh very powerful, controls everybody, is evil blah blah. All that is fine. OK, the ring is so very evil and powerful. But would'nt any rational person ask what makes the ring so powerful? The reasons are never provided. What makes it so valuable and important that people are going to wars over it, people are mutating over it and why does the villain want it? What is its secret? It would'nt be unfair to assume that the Return of the King answers all these questions. It absolutely does not.There is simply no story in this movie. It fails to explain what happened or even whats going on. As with the ring, why should one also has to presume that Sauron is so evil that hes worth fighting with all the armies of middle earth? With so much story surrounding Sauron, his appearance is restricted to nothing more than a large fiery eye. Just why is he so evil. Just why is he so feared? What did he do that was so bad? None of that is ever answered in any of the LOTR movies.Devoid of a story, the whole series are nothing more than a tour through middle earth when your, or anyone else's specific presence do not really matter. It looks more like a big documentary rather than a movie. The first two parts may have been slightly entertaining but streaching the same formula for yet another movie delivers an abysmally boring experience. The inhabitants of middle earth may have also been something original when Tolkien wrote them, but it is not so today."

tt0120815,"I some times wonder if Spielberg is one of those contributors to modern anti-semitism in the sense that everything he does is so incredibly cheezy, so old-school outdated cinema style with all that long, soggy melodrama, those tell-tale ""musical effects"" or whatever one calls that ambient background music that changes along with the scenes in the movie... this is funny because one can GUESS without looking at who's the director by just listening carefully 10-20 minutes into the movie that Spielberg is the director... it's literally that obvious. I am not sure if ""Uncle Zoid"" from that one Futurama episode was a deliberate satirical stab at Spielberg or the same kind of outdated directors as he is, but that one episode summed it up perfectly. Anyhoo..... Unlike the Shoah cash-cow ""Shindler's List"" which was made with such severe historic digressions that even Shindler's actual real life family complained about it - in this movie Spielberg takes on what is possibly one of the best paying gigs in the entire US-viewer oriented genres of movies: feelgood American war heroes. Not just that, but in the finest way possible; as in a handful of guys take on half of Wehrmacht who are of course complete morons who have no idea how to shoot straight... and the main aim of their heroic K/D ratio of 100:1 in the movie is... *US patriotism intensifies*... to save a private who's already advanced very far in the war, because Uncle Sam said enough of his family members died. Ugh... And while U-Boot was the antithesis of this movie in absolutely every regard, Spielberg took no notes what so ever. The same way how USA today makes up historical drama about what it did or did not do, the same way does Spielberg make movies.So all that being said, if one is not as critical then the movie is ""okay"". Good enough entertainment if one closes an eye and does not think too hard. But it's eons away from other war movies that do not depict war the same way Die Hard depicts hostage situations."
tt0111161,"Shawshank Redemption is overrated. It's a decent, above average film, but by no means a great film.The inmates are pretty much likeable, while the warden and his pet guard are monsters. Also as Freeman's character says: ""You know that everybody in here's innocent?"" As the story develops you feel like he is right, the only criminals are the ones guarding the prisoners.This is a sentimental piece made to stir the emotions, but not to stir them too much. Just enough to make the viewer feel there is injustice in the world but that in the end everything ends well and justice surely comes to he who waits 20 years or so for it.The Shawshank Redemption is, as I said, a decent film, possibly among the top five films of 1994. IMO the best films of 1994 are Pulp Fiction and L√©on."
tt0261492,"Wow! Bad acting, questionable costumes, poorly written. Characters are cardboard cutouts that move. However, there are more black actors in this 2001 television show than in the whole entertainment industry that year. But hey, did the heroine have to be so blond? I'd never seen it when it was on, but I'm watching it now (winter, 2016) on an off-beat channel on a sunny Saturday in the afternoon. It's hilarious. Although, I'm not sure it's supposed to be. Never saw Baywatch either, except for those promotional shots of Pamela Anderson's bouncing boobs as she ran across the sand. I can certainly see how the two shows were produced by the same studio. I must say, the film quality and color are very good. It's like eating an attractive dessert that tastes like sawdust. Edgar Rice Burroughs would cringe at what he'd spawned--or maybe not."
tt0108052,"Schindlers list has everything. It's boring, it's horrific, it's pretentious and it's bad. I think the worst thing about Schindler's list is that it seems to be made for the director, not for the audience. It's Spielberg's message to his critics that he can be serious, but honestly, three and a half hours of black and white is trying just a bit hard, and the little red girl is just totally over the top. The worst part about it is the manipulative subject matter, the Holy Cow of the holocaust. Spielberg tries to tie up the seriousness of the plight of the Jews in World War II with the seriousness of his film making, and it turns out totally faux-arte. Give me a break."
tt0137523,"""Fight Club"" is a graphically stylish movie that vainly claims itself to being a thoughtful film, but whose effect in the end, is to aestheticize and condone the ideas it purports to examine. It is simply a violent, anti-social, and misogynist film hiding behind a veil of being a kind of psycho/social critique or expose on the masculine entity and the effect on it by North American values.I personally have no problem in the case of a truly artful and intelligent film making an argument for polemical statement and extremism; this is definitely not the case here. Content-wise, it is undeftly handled material; I think because the filmmaker was so utterly concerned with the making of certain visual moments and lost grip of the whole. I fear for all the angry young males in our society that may see this film and become inspired to re-enact the imagery.""Fight Club"" reminds me of a film that may have began as an interesting and compelling idea, but then in the course of its making, gets ""Hollywooded"". It has several fine visual moments that are in turn subverted by equally horrible ones. It insults the viewer over and over;  by employing pedantic, heavy-handed and contradictory motifs such as the highly militaristic yet zombie-esque 'army' to propagate ""mayhem""; by so glibly setting up what ultimately turns out to be a literal interpretation of multiple personality disorder (I suppose juxtaposing incongruous elements was the means).Too much visuals technology, probably too much budget and attention on the bottom line, not enough attention on structure and content, while pretending to be an ideas film, makes this an insulting and perhaps even, a dangerous movie. I wouldn't want to be working in a building who principal tenant is a credit card company for the next while."

I am very saddened that people do not see other works, and for so long this film has been number one among the best films. The actors are talented, the plot is just good, not brilliant, like Stanley Kubrick in ""A Space Odyssey"". Even this I am ready to see in the top-1, but not ""Shawshank Redemption"". I understand that many will disagree with me or say that I just hate, but this is not true, and you can understand this by comparing it with other films, is this film so good and does it deserve the first place?"
tt1345836,"To stat off I am a Nolan fan-boy so do expect a bit of a bias here - my first impression of TDKR was NOT wow (which was the case with TDK) I mean i loved the movie but it did not have so many things that its predecessor had - no joker, no awesome truck flip or the skyhook scene. no intelligent crosses like when joker sends batman to Harvey dent instead of Rachel. But despite all this, this movie had something else, something which believe lead so many people to not really appreciate it. That was its heart, its a story about Bruce Wayne, story about how he has to keep going, how it shouldn't matter that Rachel is dead or hes past his prime (make no mistake he is an aging man and not a comic character who is stuck in his thirties since over 70 years)He needed to be reminded of his true purpose and bane did just that. It made perfect sense, he learnt of his purpose due to Ra's AL ghul and if there is anyone who can re-iterate that it has to be the league of shadows itself.I think everyone should give this movie another shot, without the nitpicking, I guarantee that you will love it."
tt0172495,"What was Ridley Scott thinking? Gladiator is too long and the script tried to be too many things for too many people. Use one of those swords to whack off about two-thirds of the Commodus- is-a-really-smarmy-guy scenes and you've got something there. Russell Crowe was outstanding and the soldier who just wants to go home storyline was pleasing. Somehow, though, this one left me thinking Rambo with togos."
tt0372784,"Ever since Batman Forever this franchise has gone downhill. But if there was a movie made to resurrect it this was it and boy did it do its job. Everything you like about movies is in here. Great acting, amazing effects, a rich plot, and having a cute Defense Attorny helps too. I don't care what people say, Katie Holmes getting engaged to Tom Cruise didn't have anything to do with the success of this movie. She's just a good actress. Christian Bale is THE Bruce Wayne and always will be (except for Adam West of course). Michael Caine is a great Alfred too. The Scarecrow is the greatest psychological bad guy since Norman Bates. All in all anyone who wants to spend 2 and a half hours enjoying themselves should check out this movie. But for people who aren't fans of the books should wait for the rental."
tt0167260,"Well, it's finally over:  Peter Jackson's adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's mediocre epic concludes with  *The Return of the King*, a 3-1/2-hour test of endurance.  How many times can a movie show Elijah Wood's big blue eyes welling up with tragic tears?  how many times do our heroes single-handedly dispatch thousands of evil creatures apiece during big battles?  how many times do we have to endure the jokes from that hairy dwarf?  how many times must Howard Shore's repetitive, sappy score rise to deafening levels whenever a minor character lies in a broken heap on the battlefield?  how many times must director Jackson waste his wide screen photography with gigantic close-ups of the actors  (I haven't seen so many BIG HEADS since the last Academy Awards broadcast)?  how many times must we withstand grand, cartoon-animated armies? . . . and how many more times must we watch plot developments that contain virtually no suspense??  (What -- did you think the Dark Lord would win?  that any of the main characters of the Fellowship would actually die?)Apparently, many MORE times, because this 3-1/2-hour trudge is but the appetizer to the main course of the  ""Extended Edition"", New Line's continuing money-grab that will reveal perhaps a FIVE-HOUR version of this movie alone.  (Taken all together, *The Lord of the Rings* -- The Extended Version -- approaches the length of 14 hours, give or take.)  Well, as P. T. Barnum once observed, There's a sucker born every minute, and New Line has found the suckers, who are not only willing to pay at the movie theater, but are also only too willing to fork out exorbitant amounts for  ""special editions""  of movies that ought to have stood on their own -- AS RELEASED. A simple standard should obtain in a movie theater:  what you're seeing on the screen should be what a director wants you to see.  ""Extended-edition DVD's""  don't count, and especially should not be taken in consideration in reviews by either professional critics or by amateur reviewers at places like IMDb.  I can already hear the defenders of the films demur, ""But these movies would've been too long if Jackson didn't cut them into shorter versions!""  But that's precisely my point.  *The Lord of the Rings* remains an unfilmable book:  it's too long; it's too unwieldy.  As far as an adaptation is concerned, none -- not less -- would be more.Which is not to say that there aren't any great filmic moments in *Return of the King*:  the lighting of the watch-fires along the mountain ranges is pure cinema; the entire scene with Frodo and Sam fending off a giant spider in a cobwebby cave is terrific, providing the one suspenseful stretch in the entire movie; and Gollum remains a wonderful creation, a rare successful collaboration of technology and old-fashioned creative virtues.  Taken as a whole, the movie is better than, say, *The Matrix*  or other expensive Hollywood blockbusters of the  ""action-adventure""  genre.  But to say so is not to say much.  The occasional high points don't constitute a comprehensive whole, or make Tolkien's saga any less silly.  It's a book about magic rings, wizards, Dark Lords, and dwarfs, for God's sake.  In *Return of the King*, there's a scene in Minas Tirith where the citizens watch a sad parade of soldiers go by:  but it's comical, because everyone looks like refugees from a Renaissance Faire.  It doesn't do to inflate this material to cosmic levels.  Claims that Tolkien's fantasy was the greatest book of the 20th Century truly make my head spin:  what, was  *Ulysses* chopped liver?  What was the second greatest book -- Stephen King's  *The Stand*?Pardon my long-windedness, but the very subject inspires it.  I'll wrap by lamenting that one of the better elements in the first two installments, Christopher Lee as Saruman, was a victim of the cutting room floor.  Even fans of this material might agree with me that any number of the scenes with Frodo and Sam blubbering at each other would've been better replaced with a coda to the Saruman plot-line.  While others may say, ""Well, he'll be in the Extended-Edition version,""  I'm sure that will be cold comfort to Mr. Lee. At least Saruman was a villain we could sink our teeth into:  in *Return*, we must instead settle for that damned Eyeball atop that tower.  Granted, in this film the Eyeball has developed the power to sort of roll about, rather like a lighthouse lamp,  but it's still a pretty lame villain.  Here, perhaps more than anywhere, Jackson reveals the limitations of his source material.  In the book, as I recall, Sauron's Eyeball was really more of a psychological entity.  Grasping for any straw, Jackson has made the Eyeball a concrete reality, so that we would have SOMETHING to identify as a villain.  But don't fret:  Sauron's Nose will doubtless turn up in the Extended Edition.  In the meantime, sweet dreams, everyone."
tt0110912,"I am at a complete loss as to what anyone can see in this film. By it's very title it glorifies the days when ""story"" was a cheap and disposable commodity, and seeks to canonise it's lack of a script as a result. I'm sorry - ""anti-art"" has all been done before, and it wasn't very interesting with the dadaists back in 1915 either.Poor acting, a non-existent script, dialogue written by someone who thinks swearing still has ""shock"" value and endless, pointless violence. The burger discussion was the nearest thing to a highlight."
tt0102926,It was not bad. Mainly an over hyped.The pacing felt like a distorted quilt.The whole movie was saturated with grainy character development. I was unsure of the direction this movie wanted to take. Felt all over the place.The jail scene and the ending are the only parts worth watching.Main character was subpar. Not bad and not outstanding either. I didn't care for her past. It's the usual only the main character goes through trauma and flash backs as they try to solve a problem.Hopkins did very well but this whole movie is still overrated. It's an award-winner that's undeserving of so much hype. The Silence of the Lamb is just like the DC Joker movie. It won awards but the movie was lackluster.Verdict: Odin What have you done?
tt0816692,"Unfortunately the film didn't reach the high expectations I had for it! I love sci-fi movies but Interstellar left me flat and disappointed.First the opening hour of the film was boring and ordinary and the 'Earth's problem' with the sand storms was somehow underplayed and unmoving. I thought that maybe when they go in space things could get better... well, they did for a while but then the crew landed on the Ice covered planet and things got pretty sour.The idea of Cooper getting into the dimensional space and wrapping the story with the beginning was good but then again the end was OK and obviously left for a 2nd film.The sound was not good at all - I could barely hear and understand what they were saying, so maybe 50% of the films sound was a high pitched music overpowering the scenes.At the end I thought - this is a film for people who doesn't like sci- fi movies, don't believe in life in other planets and are narrow minded and believe only in conventional science. I suppose they got to watch something like that and like it...I appreciate the effort of everybody involved in this creation but it's not for me."
tt0068646,"I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering."
tt0313792,"This is the story of Jerry(Jason Biggs) who constantly whines because he can't seem to figure out his girlfriend Amanda(Christina Ricci) who is a little bit insane and cheats on him. But during the whole movie, Jerry has this old friend David(Woody Allen) who he spends lots of afternoons with and confides in him with his problems. I was expecting so much more of this movie but I should have known better then to have seen a Woody Allen movie which is probably as interesting as staring at a door for two hours. Maybe I'm just really dumb but this movie bore me. The story was weak and lazy and the characters never seem to know their place. The main reason why I even saw this in the first place is because I am in love with Christina Ricci and congrats to her, for doing a great job and looking stunning as usual! Anyways, there are some cute and enjoyable moments but overall this movie was dull and empty in my opinion. I would rather see anything else then this movie again 5/10."
tt0108052,"OK, I really don't like this film.  So I'll start with the positives.  That would be Ben Kingsley....ok, I guess that's it.First of all, there's the obvious fact that Spielberg was gunning for the Oscar on this one.  He picked an issue that was popular in the politically correct world of Oscar voters, one that nobody can remedy or do anything about but they all like to discuss to show how much they care, and ran with it.  The full weight of the concentration camp massacres can only really be seen in that French documentary (the name eludes me.)  And if you want to get a feel for life in Nazi Germany, you might as well watch the propaganda film ""Triumph of the Will,"" giving the viewer a chilling glimpse at the culture of national socialism.Spielberg's attempts to be ""artsie"" are incredibly phony, particularly the ""red dress girl""'s presence in a B&W film.  An Liam Neeson simply does not pull off his part.  At the film's end, you REALLY want to sympathize with Schindler when he laments that he could have saved ""one more,"" but Neeson's performance in that critical scene is unconvincing.  He plays the cold and reserved parts of Schindler's character so strongly that the character development leading to that emotional climax is lost.People rate this film highly because they feel that they're supposed to. Don't take their word.  The film (with Kingsley as the exception) is poorly acted, drawn out, and pretentious.  If you've been fortunate enough to miss this film so far, keep up the good work."
tt0848228,"I wasn't intending to write a review about The Avengers because I consider it to be one of those movies with a life spawn equal to it's running time.After the credits roll it's ""out of sight,out of mind"" for me.But seeing the praise this mediocre movie gets in most reviews and how it has managed to hit top 50 with an average of 8.7 I felt the need to even up the balance a little.First of all ,I want to say it is OK to enjoy/like/love any movie.But before claiming it to be ""the best thing ever"" take a moment to think if enjoyment and quality actually overlap.I can guess why The Avengers is so popular:-it has a cast of well-known,loved actors.-it's a comic book adaptation.-it's path has been paved by 4 prequels(without the Hulk movies)-it features a team of 6 superheroes so everyone can take his pick.-it's a light-hearted movie.-it's an action-oriented movie with flamboyant special effects.-it's targeted at the most impressionable audience:children and teenagers.Having all these ingredients the movie only had to play safe in order to be a box office success.I must congratulate the producers for perfectly anticipating and manipulating the public's expectations.Because people are indeed claiming The Avengers to be the pinnacle of super hero movies.Seriously,people? As much as I dislike Batman I still consider The Dark Knight to be way more deserving of this title.However there seems to be an overall consensus that The Avengers had brilliant,amazing,like never seen before action and humor.I must ask you,have you had your memory deleted when you entered the cinema?It's true that the movie doesn't screw up in a blatant way, and has an enjoyment factor due to the reasons I've enumerated earlier, but it consists undoubtedly of the same old clich√©s which are endlessly used and reused in super-hero/action movies:The bad guy threatens Earth->heroes are gathered to defeat him->they don't get along->the bad guy gives them a little beating->now they get along->the bad guy is defeated by the heroes.And guess where the final fight takes place?Manhattan Island.And guess what the government does without knowing the outcome of the battle?Tries to nuke the island.But let's forget the plot.Action movies almost never bother with it.Let's talk about the battles.Choreography and imagination were almost absent.At times it felt like watching a turn based fighting game.And when that huge metal worm made it's entrance I really thought they will fight it together using some cool combos, but no,Hulk simply punched it in the face.And there was an interval of several minutes during which Loki was absent from the final battle.But he was probably busy commanding his army,too bad his troops were randomly flying around,uncoordinated and without using any tactics.Maybe some BGMs would've helped the battle scenes a little, but the OST war rather shy.Not much is to be said about the characters,each have one or two defining traits(excepting Loki maybe) and that's pretty much it.The dialogue is shallow,consisting of cheesy one liners and typical lame jokes.Maybe this movie has your favorite superhero, maybe you're a big fan of the comics, maybe you ship Captain America and Iron Man or you have fantasies with Loki ,maybe you liked the 3-D ,but think before rating this movie a 9 or a 10."
tt0468569,"In the old days, film-makers told stories. Now they create effects. That tells you pretty much all you need to know about ""The Dark Knight."" If you like car chases with flashy digitization and sonic booms, you'll love ""The Dark Knight."" Otherwise, stay home and read a book.Admittedly ""The Dark Knight"" looks spectacular on an Imax screen, and Heath Ledger has to be a hands down winner of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. There are also plenty of familiar faces passing through the production -- Michael Caine, once a leading man, doing his by now standard Gielgud imitation as a butler, Morgan Freeman doing his by now standard role as God/CEO/Chief Technology Officer, Maggie Gyllenhall as the prim sexless object of everyone's affections, Christian Bale as the trust fund guy himself, Aaron Eckhart as an untouchable prosecutor. They meander and lurch through a plot so turgid that it isn't even worth diagramming as they face assorted actual and threatened explosions, free falls, assaults with deadly weapons, shattered windows, fires, and the aforementioned vehicle chases. For 152 minutes or so until finally, at long last, the closing credits come up, and everyone can go home.There's no magic, no mystery, no glamor, no insight, no humanity in this movie. It's all ""BANG,"" ""POW,"" ZAP,"" ""CRASH,"" ""BOOM."" And it's all pointless."
tt1345836,This film has the misfortune to be a sequel to one of the greatest films of all time. The Dark Knight is no easy act to follow. However Nolan does an amazing job of adding spectacle to make the final installment of the trilogy memorable. The realism has always made this series stand above the rest. Are there some plot holes? Yes. Do they make it a bad film? No. Go watch Justice League then honestly tell me TDKR is bad. It's not. It is simply over shadowed by its predecessor.
tt0397103,"This movie was very good and uplifting, and it was written to educate about a great cause. While I think a few of the scenes are not necessary to the movie, like Katie's issue with her boyfriend, the movie as a whole was very good and definitely uplifting.Operation Smile, the real organization upon which the movie's ""Doctor's Gift"" is based, is fast becoming a great, well-known international organization. I myself am involved in Operation Smile and it is very rewarding--I hope to go on a mission trip with them within the next year or two. If you have a chance to get involved, you definitely should. Their website is www.operationsmile.org ."
tt0120737,"First off, I'd like to make a statement: I have not read any of the LOTR books by Tolkien. I once started out in The Hobbit, but didn't think much of it. So I'd like to review the Movie, and will not relate it to the book. So I don't care if Middle Earth 'came to life' to some viewers, or if the Orks really had 3 eyes or whatever. I don't care about that.Let's start with a view at the story. A ring that has the power to destroy the world falls into the hands of young Frodo (Wood), who with help of several friends has to destroy it on a special place. The first movie of the trilogy basically are these people on their journey to that place.And that's it. I don't care where that place is, which member of the Fellowship really is the son of whom, what is going to happen in the next movies or whatever. This is the open ended story presented, and it's really not that interesting. Way too many (unimportant) characters are involved, the movie is lacking in story and pace and isn't as epic as a lot of people (mostly fans of the book), make you believe it is.If you analyze it, the movie goes like this: Group of people taking a journey. Have a fight. Lose a guy. Continue journey. Have a fight. Lose a guy. Continue journey, etcetera, etcetera. These fights might be against different enemies (Orks, Uru-kai, a huge monster or black knights), it all comes down to the same thing. And that, to be honest, is a bit boring.The worst part though is that when Lotr:Fotr finally does finish, nothing has really happened. They're still on their journey, still losing guys and I'm sure they're gonna have a lot more fights in the other 2 films, of which I already saw The Two Towers. Is it really necessary to expand an easy (mind you, I didn't say bad) story to a 9 hour movie extravaganza? For instance, is Cate Blanchetts character really of importance to the movie? No, the only reason she's in there because she's in the book. And that's a pretty lame reason, since this is Film-making we're talking about.Now, it's not that the Fellowship is a really bad movie. It all looks phenomenal and we have to congratulate Peter Jackson for the fact he got those studio people mad (or, in retrospect, wise) enough to spend so much money on it. We have to respect Tolkien for creating an exciting world, full of imaginative details.But, for the many things Fellowship is (a cool look at the book for fans?), a good movie it most definitely is not. 6/10."
tt0268200,"Ok, the acting is not world-class, but is decent. The story is surprisingly good. A little slow in the beginning, suggest you give it a chance of you enjoy movies with a message."
tt0102926,"I had to look at a movie for school and I had to pick one out of the top 100 list on a site or in our workbook. I picked out this movie because I once saw it but didn't finish it and now I wanted to look at it again and completely. at first when I had only heard about the movie, I thought it was going to be a horrible movie with lots of killing and that it wasn't really my kind of movie. but after I looked at it once I saw that it was not horrible at all, there was some kind of psychological aspect in the film and that was something I liked. So now that I looked at it for the second time, my meaning is that it was very good, i looked at it without stopping. it was not boring me at all. the great lines of the film were fascinating, that is why i think this movie belongs to the best and also to the top 100. the actors did a great job, especially the kind of relation between Clarisse Starling and Hannibal Lecter. it was very special. their conversations in prison were interesting and Lecter was always so mysterious. I will say to other people that they will have to look at the movie, because I can not say a bad thing about it at all. it wasn't a horrible thriller like most of the time and that is something I really liked."
tt0068646,"I remember distinctly the first time I saw ""The Godfather"". I was a child and it was being shown on broadcast television.  Granted, neither of theses are optimal conditions for rendering an informed opinion but I remember being struck with how unremarkable- in fact how boring I found the film.  I was particularly surprised by this, as there had been a great fanfare over the broadcast. I chalked this up to my own immaturity and thought no more of it.The second time I saw the film was in college.  My friend had a brother who was quite a film enthusiast and he, like many others, counted ""The Godfather"" as the finest film.  One evening my friend and I watched the film.  The viewing once again left me unimpressed.  I feigned an enthusiasm for the film that I did not feel, as it seemed the popular, and even the intellectual expectation.  Once again I associated my dislike for the movie with a failing in myself. I apparently did not appreciate a ""good movie"" when I saw one.Since that time I have seen many films, from many directors, from many countries, in many languages, and with varying budgets from independent offerings to mainstream Hollywood fare.  I certainly do not consider myself to be an expert but feel myself to be an informed member of an audience. Armed with my experience I recently viewed ""The Godfather"" again to expunge my previous failures and to gleefully join the ranks of Godfather sycophants.  Well, I think you know the outcome.  As they say in baseball, three strikes and you're out.I find the film to be completely un-redeeming in every way.  I do not have space to address the film systematically or technically so I will speak to my central grievance- the story is hollow.  There is no moral center.I do not demand that a movie have morality.  I do not demand that a film even have a point.  I can take a film at its face value for what it is.  A slapstick comedy is foolish and an action flick is mindless, I do not ask that they be a different movie- only that they meet the narrow definition to which they aspire.  The problem is that ""The Godfather"" aspires to be a great drama and that aspiration comes with high expectations.Gratuitous violence is expected in big-budget action flicks, amorality can be understood in the quiet desperation of an independent film's philosophy, and self-indulgence is to be expected in the over-the-top musical extravaganza.  However, violence, amorality, and self-indulgence in a film that portrays itself as mainstream drama or even tragedy are reprehensible. This is not art- it is base voyeurism at its worst.  We are standing in the bailey at New Castle or at the Coliseum watching with leering stares at the baseness and depravity of man. This film is not a criticism of man's foul nature, as in the above referenced independent film; it is a celebration of it.  Anyone who claims otherwise deludes himself.Thus conceived I can appreciate `The Godfather' as a film oddity, a curious victory of the popularity of evil men.  But to say that it is a great film is scandalous, and to say that it is the greatest film is blasphemous.  To say that the highest achievement of man in film is a celebration of cruelty, deception, and greed is a statement that many should reconsider.I find it interesting that many of those who claim ""The Godfather"" as their favorite film, or the best film of all time can count their viewings of the film on one hand. In fact, I myself (who thinks unfavorably of the film) have given the film more attention then many of the ""fans"" I know.  A friend of mine who professes to like the film recently returned the box-set DVD ""Godfather"" collection that he received for Christmas.  As he put it, he loved the film but when was he ever going to watch it?  That is faint praise indeed for the ""greatest film of all time"".I am sure there are those who genuinely enjoy the film, but you could say that about any movie.  I would advise those who fawn over this film so to ask themselves if their enthusiasm comes from within or from a modern mythology. ""The Godfather"" is a paper tiger."
tt7286456,"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.
What doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.Another thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.
Also I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.In conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer."
tt0108052,"This movie took a subject which was extremely complicated and difficult, and dumbed it down to the level that everyone except Representative Tom Coburn (OK) could understand it (he complained about the networks ""polluting the minds of our children"" when it was shown on tv, because it had nudity and violence). Oscar Schindler was an anti-semite, a real anti-semite. Someone once asked him why he had done what he did, and he said something along the lines of ""if you see a dog hit by a car dying in the street, you know you're better then the dog, but you still want to help it"" (he was equating Jews with dogs, placing them on the same moral level). He was also a womanizer and alcoholic. The golden ring he was given at the end of the film, in real life was later traded for a drink. This was not the same Schindler portrayed in the movie. The film attempted to show some of his ""seedy"" side, I think that's what the secretary hiring scene was supposed to be, but it didn't really work, and I didn't end up thinking Oscar Schindler was that bad of a guy. This could have been a much richer film if it was about a bad person who did a good thing, which was what the historical event actually was.The film, I think, was meant to be an educational project. It was meant to teach people about the holocaust when they really didn't know much about it. As that, it succeeds. This is a movie that should be shown to middle school students when the holocaust is being studied. It brings knowledge to the masses which they otherwise would not have known about. but as art, as a movie, it just dressed itself up as a ""serious art film"", while actually really dumbing down the subject. If you're already familiar with the subject matter, if you already knew genocide was bad, that Nazis were crazy, and that the holocaust was an enraging and sad event, then there's really nothing in the movie to think about. I would put this film in the same class as Man On The Moon - mediocre films that have nothing to offer beyond introducing the audience to events they may be unfamiliar with."
tt0068646,"No.1 Movie of all time? I think that's what ruined it for me, I sat down expecting to watch the most spectacular cinematic experience of my life - but instead I ended up sitting rather bored for the good part of 3hours.Everything about it just lacked in moving me, the vengeance was untouched, parts of the story seemed to obvious and other parts just left untouched. Thoroughly this was the most disappointing film I've ever seen, not the worst, just the most disappointing. I'm not trying to change anyone's thoughts on the film or make out the film is bad - just in case anyone gets the impression.Thanks"
tt0102926,"Somewhat an inferior sequel to ""Manhunter,"" we find Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) assigning FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to interview Lecter about killer Buffalo Bill, who has been kidnapping young women throughout the southern United States.Much like ""Manhunter,"" this movie focuses on the investigator. However, Clarice Starling isn't nearly as interesting as Will Graham. She thinks she's one of the big boys, but hasn't done anything to prove herself and actually shows herself unworthy of that recognition.Anthony Hopkins, replacing Brian Cox, hams up the role of Lecter, taking away a bit of a creepy edge. Jodie Foster proves that accents aren't one of her talents. Scott Glenn is once again great in a small role.The movie unwraps slowly, but without worthy characters, we don't find ourselves interested in what develops. The movie doesn't really pick up until the climatic confrontation.A year after this movie's release, ""Basic Instinct"" was badly received for its perceived homophobic content. However, ""Basic Instinct"" only had a killer that happened to be a lesbian, where ""Silence of the Lambs"" creates an explicit link between the killer's killing and his sexual confusion, definitely making it the more homophobic of the two.It's a good story of a young woman's growth, but it's not compelling or thrilling."
tt0167260,"This episode of the series was the most disappointing, not because of any lack of eye candy, which was good, but for the focus and the changes made to the conclusion. I was really into the first film, the second filled in the important place between what should have been a great beginning and action packed end... This one fell short of the grandiosity I perceived in the books. Peter Jackson is brilliant in bringing the books to life as well as he did, but this was honestly over hyped. It was probably the ending that put the nail in the coffin. Being a fan of the books I expected something a little better, but it was perhaps my girlfriend of the time who put the right perspective on it likening the end-scene to a homosexual punchline."
tt0110912,"in the wake of his awesome debut, Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino could have served up just about anything and it would have been hailed as a masterpiece by all those keen to jump on the bandwagon. he, sadly, did just serve up anything.on your first viewing, Pulp Fiction does take your breath and look stunning. if you want to join the masses and celebrate this film blindly, you may then want to avoid the rest of this review and never watch the film more than once.if you be generous enough to let the flimsy, contrived plot threads go by you, the real problem here is what the film was oddly celebrated for - the bad writing and the lousy dialog that shall forever haunt this film. sure, there are one or two smart one-liners, but the problem is that each and every character in this film talks, acts and behaves the same. the lengthy speech given by Christopher Walken, for instance, is the same in tone and content as anything that Samuel L Jackson would say, and likewise Sam just talks like Uma Thurman, who talk like Bruce Willis, who talks like John Travolta, etc, etc ad nauseum.this, and the subsequent, poorer films he made, revealed Tarantino to be a confidence trickster, a, if you will, one trick pony. what a shame, he looked like he had so much talent and potential.be brave, do not just follow the crowd and the masses - see this badly written home movie for the low grade, half-dimensional nonsense that it is!!"
tt1130884,"Are the holocaust-movies so plenty lately that even the most liberal ones are getting tired of them? But you still need to push the agenda to guilt-trip the people? Well lets make a completely unrelated movie, then scatter ¬Ñflashbacks"" in it with the most emotionally loaded pictures possible! (Dead and frozen women and children puring out of boxcars? Only the dead puppy is missing!) You might as well also put a historical controversy in the flashbacks about Allied war crimes and than claim it's a madman's fantasy at the and while you are at it. Some radical feminist agenda can also be found in the movie, for example the way they present domestic violence, or that the husband is responsible for everything, even his wife's crimes.The story itself is OK, with a clever plot twist. However there is something amiss the whole time and not in the way they intended: the island supposed to be a well locked mental hospital for the most dangerous criminally insane people in the US. But there are no Hannibal Lecters locked up there! The inmates you find are ordinary madmen with 1-2 ¬Ñordinary"" kills (without extreme brutality) tops, some of them didn't even kill anyone. These people wouldn't need a maximum security institute. The same is the problem with the threat that they will find a way to diagnose the inspector with something and than keep him there: an ordinary madman has no place in a maximum security madhouse.To sum it up: the idea for the story is good and they could have made a really good movie of it if it wasn't just an excuse for pushing an agenda. Like this it's so full of mistakes it's barely a mediocre movie."
tt7286456,"I thought this movie was complete and utter garbage. I don't understand why people liked this movie so much. The character doesn't even stay true to the comics and the director flat out said it didn't, and then they made it seem like it was part of Gothams fall and he was just a little boy that had a laughing problem... Hated it"
tt0114369,"This film was OK. It was very dark and not very watchable at times. It definitely ranks up there with other films of it's genre, but you wonder why Hollywood keeps churning out these dark, morose films without any to cheer about.You know Morgan never fails to deliver and Pitt was also excellent. Very suspenseful. Kept me on the edge of my seat and has a lot of those type of scenes that make you jump out of your seat and scared the heck out of you. This movie is non stop thrills and chills not a great date movie though, tends to scare to point where your shaking at the end of the movie.I'm not a fan of Fincher films except for 'The Game'. I'm not into worshipping serial killers because guess what: it breeds more serial killers."
tt0120815,"This week, I've seen Saving Private Ryan in class. This film amazes me, like, a lot. Everything I've seen in this film, matches my own image about the Second World War. Everything that had happened in the movie, could have happened during the Second World War itself. When I currently think about the Second World War, after seeing the film, I just think about the beach-rush scene. Everything was filmed in a way like somebody was there, filming it all. Every sound you hear, every word that the soldiers say, could have been said in 1944 as well. Corporal Upham is my favourite character of the film, just because he's different than the other soldiers. He shows that he doesn't like the war, doesn't want to fight, and wants to forget it all. All of the deeds and actions shown in the film represent what could have happened in the war. I really felt like taking actions during the film, just because most of the things that happen in the movie, don't really happen anymore. This film is absolutely stunning."
tt0480025,"There is no doubt that this film is a truly great piece of film-making. Shane Meadows crafts films in the same style as Martin Scorcese. We are given a glimpse into the lifestyle of a group of characters over a short period of time. It is very much a fly on the wall type of movie. The point of these films is to understand the actions of the characters rather than judging their actions. I have no doubt that there will be some people that tag this film as being racist which is rather missing the point.The film follows Shaun a 12 year old being borough up in early 80's England. He has lost his father in the Falklands war and suffers bullying and isolation until he is befriended by a group of skinheads. The happy band are challenged when Combo is released from prison. Thomas Turgoose is magnificent in the lead role and the direction/screenplay are also spot on the mark. For anybody that lived through the period there are lots of reminders about the period. The film is based on Meadow's own childhood and is quite mesmerising at times.I was gripped throughout the film and it also gave me plenty to think about afterwards. What more can you ask for when going to the movies? I suppose if you go to the movies for escapism then go watch something else, but if you want a gripping thought provoking drama then it doesn't come much better than this. Outstanding!"

Throughout the movie, one can notice some great scene was about to emerge, it did shine sometimes, but it failed, it was spoiled. 4 out of 10 - Try harder and better..."
tt0120815,"My grandfather fought in WW2 somehow surviving D-Day. He was apart of Operation Neptune and stormed the beaches of Normandy. He told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day. Before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about. He loved watching war movies... not sure exactly why. Some about that soldier life never really leaves them I guess. He absolutely hated Pearl Harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who don't know what to do in the event of being attacked. He had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance. Soldiers don't take girlfriends on private plane rides. And they most definitely know how to swim. Maybe I'll give that movie a good ripping one day.But Saving Private Ryan was a respectable ""I can't watch this"" reaction. He said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like. He said it was too realistic. Whether or not the story is based on real or fiction, that intro was 100% realistic. I'm not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before. I watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather. A scene he was technically in. Which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really is.War is hell and this movie not only shows that while being an entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers are left behind with. My grandfather was not afraid of anything. I've seen this man walk into a cellar full of black widows to get firewood and not even shake them off. The only time he ever experienced fear was when he went to bed. His nightmares of his time during the war would haunt him in his sleep. This movie helped me understand why."
tt0137523,"I watched the first hour and a half of this movie when I was 16 before I asked my boyfriend to turn it off because it was too dark. Now I am in my early 20s and I watched it until the very end, credits and all, and it truly is the best thing I've ever watched. I'm obsessed and I cant wait to watch it again. I reckon it will hit me even harder when I am older and I'm sure it will be just as fantastic.Everything from the plot, the acting, even the damn lighting of every scene is art. I cannot believe I was not pushed to rewatch it sooner. I writing this as 1am because I cant stop thinking about it. It will seep into my dreams and I'm not sure if that is terrifying or thrilling. Maybe both"
tt0468569,"(Synopsis) Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The Joker's plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos, and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him.(My Comment) This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred, the trusted butler. Heath Ledger's performance as the sadistic Joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley, and whatever you do, don't ask him how he got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. Ledger's performance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good sinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain, as well as Order verses Anarchy, and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one you must have the other, and because of that, they will always be connected. The movie is long, but it went by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions, body count, and the dark mood of the movie, I don't think parents should take young children. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:32, Rated PG-13)(10/10)"
tt0848228,"Not very good- loosely based on the comic. Character development is poorly done. All these characters just meet and then get to know so much about each other in so short amount of time. External information about the ""bad guy"" is learned to quickly. How can you tell his habits if he has only just been introduced to you a few hours ago..? I was really looking forward to this movie, heard so many good things, but it was a total bust. ANDDD.. the amount of info known about the Hulk before they even meet is a lot- like the security guard when he falls down. This is prefect for a comic- but bad movie adaptation. More time would be needed for the development and information to make sense accordingly."
tt0172495,"The movie is the story of Maximus (Crowe), a general who leads the Roman army to victory over Germania in the beginning of the movie. The dying emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius, is watching this battle.The emperor's son, Commodus, then arrives with his sister Lucilla, and it is discovered that Commodus fully expects to be announced the new emperor of Rome in a few days. Aurelius, however, has other plans--he wants to make Maximus emperor, and requests that of the general, who wants nothing more than to go home to his family.I went into this movie having just watched Ben-Hur in my film studies class and having watched an episode of Xena only a couple of weeks earlier that featured the story of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra. So you could say I was in the perfect mindset to watch a ""sword-and-sandal"" movie. I wasn't sure what to expect, having somehow avoided all the hype that accompanied this movie. But I was not disappointed.Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The battle scenes are very graphic. (This movie is not for the squeamish, that's for sure.) There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such as when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast.  The use of color and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie. Excellent.The script was being written and re-written as the filming was going on, yet it doesn't show that the actors had no idea how the movie was going to end when they began filming.  The acting is terrific. Russell Crowe is wonderfully cast as Maximus. Many reviewers agree that he is now officially a star. Joaquin Phoenix also proves his mettle as the emotionally troubled Commodus, whose behavior and emotion toward his sister could give anyone the creeps. Connie Nielsen makes you believe that, as Lucilla, she really is torn between natural loyalty to her brother and doing what she knows is right. Oliver Reed, in his last performance, is memorable in his role of Proximo, the former gladiator who is the owner of Maximus and brings him to Rome.  In short, the actors were brilliant in their roles, not over-acting, but giving subtle, strong performances.The script itself is very good.  Although some elements are a little hard to believe--the fact that no one recognizes Maximus when he's a slave?--this film calls for a willing suspension of disbelief, which one would happily comply with.  (It's really no fun to nitpick such a movie.)It's true that this movie does pretty much follow the Braveheart formula. However, this movie includes some elements, such as the cinematography and the incredibly graphic battle scenes (one reviewer likened it to Saving Private Ryan, ""only better""), that are spectacular in itself. Overall, a great movie that I highly recommend."
tt0137523,"Adapted from the transgressive novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club is a tour-de-force in violence, action, provocation and unreliable narration. Its story is meticulously crafted so that the great reveal, whilst shocking, also makes a great deal of sense. Brad Pitt's iconic performance as the now infamous Tyler Durden is never less than engrossing and the twisted bromance/romance menage-a-trois which provides the film's heart is delightfully unique.Fincher's direction is pulsating, unforgiving and slick. The film broods with intensity but never takes itself too seriously. In fact, its at times off-beat quirkiness somehow enhances the most disturbing scenes. There's a nonchalance to the psychological and physical suffering that takes place in the film which is as well-judged as it is disturbing.This is not a film for all tastes; however, unlike a number of films which came out around a similar time, there is real substance which underpins the film's iconic style. It is a deeply masculine film about the need to feel connected. It's a film which revels in nihilism that is about the need to find some form of meaning. It's a film which seeks to provoke but not idly or immaturely; at its heart, it seeks to stand up for the down-trodden, the neglected, the marginalised, the weak. It wishes to say, whoever you are, however low you have fallen, there is a place for you and your journey may yet remain to be defined. After all, if a character as maladjusted and confused as the unreliable narrator of this film can find some sense of meaning in his life, then there must be hope for all of us yet."
tt0993846,"It's no surprise that Scorsese is associated with the gangster genre with films such as The Departed, Goodfellas and Casino, of which the last two are possibly the best pure examples of the genre. In Goodfellas the gangsters are dangerous but they operate on a more underground level, in Casino they practically run a major city and can do whatever they like. The gangsters were and will always be a part in America's system. Now, the gangsters are not just accepted by the system, but are considered to be an integral part of it. In the first two films, the gangster is threatening and dangerous, but avoidable. In The Wolf of Wall Street, he's calling to hustle you at home and you don't even know it. Some people view The Wolf of Wall Street as a glorification of Jordan Belfort's lifestyle and want to be like him, as Scorsese portrays this life by its nature, enticing. That's the way it works, and it's impossible to portray it accurately without showing how a charismatic man like Belfort can suck an unsuspecting person into a world of money and fame. The film though, shows us just how empty and destructive that life can be.There is an undeniable similarity between the instantaneous joy, energy and euphoria that we have while watching The Wolf of Wall Street and how Jordan Belfort lives his life, this is a movie where the director skillfully mixes form and content to create an experience which is as hyper and as instantly ecstatic as the life of its flashy and opportunistic characters.The direction by Martin Scorsese which still has infectious energy and power is impeccable, there is no other director who has mastered pacing like he has. This is a three-hour movie that moves lightning fast and always manages to keep the audience invested in the story throughout the whole duration. Each scene is packed with so much visual information, and it is fast paced and quickly edited, which complements the general tone of the film. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is gorgeous as well and displays an optimal color palette throughout the whole film. Each shot also looks precise, even during some of the more chaotic scenes.The script is fantastic, filled with many great and memorable lines of dialogue. Every character has a well-defined arc and motives, and the story is given proper breathing room to blossom. The performances are also exquisite, especially Leonardo DiCaprio who gives one of the best performances of his career and portrays the opportunistic nature of Jordan Belfort's character with great commitment as you can see a lustful, hedonistic and impulsive sex & drug-addict man who only wants to have more fun. Supporting him with equal passion is Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's sidekick, and even he manages to make a mark of his own. Margot Robbie plays Naomi, Belfort's second wife and she does an alluring job in her given role. Matthew McConaughey is in for a very short duration as Mark Hanna, Belfort's mentor, but even in that little time, he is the show-stealer and he dominates the screen unlike anyone else.Martin Scorsese and Terence Winter set out to create a film about the Wall Street excess, and by definition, it contains an excessive amount of everything, such as cursing, sex, nudity, drugs, alcohol and partying. But the film is not really about those things. The story of The Wolf of Wall Street boils down to money, that ""most-addictive drug"" Belfort speaks of, and not just what it can buy, but what it can do to people. Not just how it changes one's lifestyle but the effects it has on one's morals, beliefs, and values, and how it can effectively change not just how a person thinks and feels but how they operate at their core.With a collection of truly incredible films, The Wolf of Wall Street stands out as one of Scorsese's best films, my personal favorite and by far his most humorous film to date. He truly went all out and it paid off in a hilarious satire on the reverence of money, drugs, women, and the admiration of a criminal money-maker. The Wolf of Wall Street is maddening cinema that's already high on coke but still continues to snort more white powder every 5 minutes for 3 hours. This is a fascinating vignette of excess, greed, abuse and decay and it's one of the best movies of the decade and surely one of the most entertaining movies ever made."
tt0133093,Let's face it folks take away all the fancy shmancy special effects and what are you left with? An average at best action movie. I never bothered to watch the sequels as they looked like crap from the previews and with this one still in my memory I decided there was nowhere to go but down.
tt0167261,"In the Two Towers (TT) we are re-united with most of our heroes from the Fellowship of the Ring (FotR). Split apart by betrayal, and a company of orcs, Frodo and Sam have begun the last leg of their quest to Mordor. Ant and Dec (sorry, Merry and Pippin) are prisoners of the orcs, pursued by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli ¬ñ a quest that brings the company, and the people of Rohan, closer to conflict.Opinion is divided about the second film. The entertainment junkies seem to think it's better than the first, largely on account of the Battle of Helms Deep, which is rather impressive. I thought it was a bit weaker, mainly because, in a wilderness adventure, there's more emphasis on the characters than in the spectacle of set piece action; and because the CGI is less subtle as a result.Once again, liberties are taken with the story. There's no riding of the Grey Company. There's a more obvious tension between Eowyn and Aragorn (Legolas has to remind Aragorn who he's dating), and (controversial among the Tolkienites) Faramir's character has been darkened somewhat. In fact, the directorial trait of adding more colour to the main characters while painting out the subtlety of the peripheral ones continues from FotR. Partly because we're introduced to more characters in TT, the overall effect leaves the film slightly two-dimensional. On balance I thought the treatment of Faramir to be less heinous than that of Denethor in Return of the King, but more on that later.The mood, though, remains pure Tolkien and that, more than anything, is the triumph of the movie. From the Beowulf-like set for Meduseld (Tolkien famously nicked his description of the seat of Rohan from the UK's first epic) to the majestic sweep of New Zealand, the film more than once reminded me of my own mental images of Tolkien's world. And, once again, I found myself interested in the story.So, to the flaws. I mentioned in an earlier review of FotR the astonishing heighism in Peter Jackson's adaptation. You can imagine Jackson scratching his head wondering what to do for laughs now that Ant and Dec have been nicked by Ugluk, Grishnakh and the lads. His solution is ingenious; find the next shortest member of the company. Gimli, therefore, shoulders the mantle of comedy relief. As a strapping man of 6'4'' I am allowed a certain disdainful disinterest to such a phenomenon; but it is worth noting. Also worth noticing is the astonishing transformation of Arwen from a feisty, most un-Tolkien lady in FotR to the submissive pre-Raphaelite stereotype of the books. I guess this is because Eowyn has turned up, but still. The Elves still speak like they're doped up, except the peculiarly immune elfin fancy boy, Legolas. On that note, was it really necessary for him to mount his horse that way? Or surf his way down a staircase at the battle of Helms Deep? Jim Horner should do an alternative Beach Boys theme for that scene.Anyway, these are minor points in a film that is, if not a major, then at least a minor, triumph. As mentioned by others, the film is worth seeing for Gollum alone. And I can think of many more reasons to see it. You could also check out the extended version, which is even better. 7/10."
tt0429078,"This movie will show you how crouching tiger hidden dragon style movies can fail. The story is very one dimensional and the storytelling/editing is very linear and drab. The action scenes are OK but the real Achilles heel of this movie is the editing and the angles of the shots themselves- they are stale and boring. The cast is talented both in martial arts and acting, but the story is too thin to stretch over the amount of time it takes to tell the tale. Basically the story is bad guy coming, everybody run and then the seven swords will fight the bad guy- I'm thinking that part of the story should have taken about 15 minutes.. so what about the rest of the film what other stories are there to tell here? This film is very short on plot and it gets painful after a while. There are some good scenes but it isn't worth waiting through the boring pointless ones to get to them. This movie is a must miss which is sad because some of the people in the movie worked very hard at it and for nothing."
tt0120815,"And that is it, a war movie. The first 12 minutes of the movie, for once, show a realistic depiction of war.It's kind of what you would imagine a war to be, chaotic and hectic and on the field as unstructured as can be. Gruesome and painful to watch.It's very well acted and has some character development, but it won't draw in people who don't like war movies.For people who have been in war, have loved ones or are American I can totally see the reasons to like it, but for me as someone who doesn't specifically enjoy the topic of war it only does so far.Good performances and a great execution didn't totally suck me into the story. Which doesn't mean it's not excellent. The effort being put into making this movie more realistic really paid off. And there are some fantastic scenes.So who should watch this movie: anyone up to see a great acted realistic war movie is absolutely enjoy this movie. If you never really liked war movies you probably can skip this one. It's a true war movie throughout and it is unlikely to draw you to the genre."
tt0993846,"I've always thought that there must be a very good reason for a movie to last 3 hours. Wolf of wall street does last 3 hours but there no shadow of a good reason for it. It could have lasted 1 hour and it would have been already too long.It is difficult to summarize all the things I didn't like but let's try:1- Characters development is simply not existent. There is no depth, just one-dimension flat characters that only do drugs, sex, and money. I am not against showing drugs or sex or money in a movie, if it helps the plot. But in this case, it didn't. It was 2 hours of absolute useless display of all the possible debaucheries on earth, without them helping in building up the characters. 2- If a guy manages to build up an empire based on a fraud, I'd like to see what happens to his victims too, and, sorry if I am not a master of Wall street, but I'd like to have 5 minutes of the movie spent in explaining what was this fraud about. 3- If the guy, once again, not only builds his own empire, but also drags other people in that, I suppose he must have some smartness, or intelligence, or be a master manipulator.. whatever it is, it cannot be just (once again) cocaine and prostitute. If they wanted to depict the guys as villains, they failed miserably. 4- the only relatively interesting part (the trial etc) is cut to 30-45 minutes max. Once again, I supposed it could have been a good chance to show some introspection of the characters, some development..something! But no, once again, nothing. We only notice that now the beer is not alcoholic. So sad. 5-Finally, DiCaprio performance: he did his job, probably, but he was alway over the top (and not in a good sense). Too much of everything, to the point that he fell into being ridiculous more than believable.Ah, one last note. Wall Street? Where is it in all the story? I expected to see some connections to WS in fact, like what was going on in the meantime but there is - sorry to repeat myself- basically nothing about it."

tt1345836,"The characters are void of purpose most of the movie; terrible explanation of why and who are the ""people"" raising against the status quo; fighting scenes that are worst than Chinese B movies (knocking a guy out with a box is not acceptable anymore, or a dozen armed men choosing to wait those extra seconds just enough to fail and then trowing punches at the bat instead of using the guns in the first place), the whole bruce wayne goes to ""hell on earth"" prison that ends up to be a hole with a bunch of old farts where all he does are some sit-ups... come on, it's just plane wrong.

tt0137523,"""Fight club"" - one of the most noteworthy movies of our time will tell the story of the companionship of the thirty-year-old insomniac storyteller, who struggles with his own demons in order to discover meaning or reason in a life full of fearing with an irregular traveling companion on the plane, named Tyler Durden. Tyler is the total inverse of the hero, he is striking, brutal, handsome, and does not follow the rules. Permeated with his philosophy, the hero tries to mimic Tyler, mysteriously, he finds himself drawn into an entire arrangement of quickly creating occasions, each of which opens him an unused look at the world arrange. First and foremost, they open a battle club, the major run the show of which is ""Do not tell anybody around battle club.""... However, the hero did not expect the inexplicable situation, where he finds himself drawn into the world of the underground boxing army and advance chaos around world. Nevertheless, everything changes when Tyler Durden is not real. I suppose that he is his undisclosed identity or ideal version of himself, because he wanted to be like him, and he becomes him, without even knowing about it. The script makes the film significant and ideally will never get old. The bleak atmosphere with an impressed around, and dark humor make the film - really the most prominent of all time. The storyteller leads us through the entire film, telling us around his torments and sentiments in representations highly regarded to his terse expressions. It draws the watcher in, not because they are clever or philosophical (although usually moreover in specific). But since they are pertinent and will be important within the future indeed more. Tyler Durden has speculations, as well. But he tells them to the storyteller. We tune in and dive into it. For a few reasons, the audience accepts Tyler. He talks like a grown-up, with prove. His hypotheses concern humankind and manliness. This movie is not about violence. It's about fears and character. It's about activity. About sluggishness. About waking up and realizing that at some point in the past we gave up on our dreams, without even realizing that society dictated their visions of life. Summarizing, it is worth highlighting once again: the production, the costumes, the bizarre atmosphere and the final scene. Among the actors, I will single out the amazing Brad Pitt (Tyler) and the gorgeous Helena Bonham Carter (Marla). Edward Norton (the Narrator) generally coped with the role normally, but during the viewing I got the impression that anyone could take his place. The trio, the chemistry between them is insane, they attract and repel like the movie. I think that was also the main goal.Impressions are quite ambiguous. If I were a guy, I probably would have taken this movie with great enthusiasm, would have started denying all values, running into trouble, fighting until my face turned into a bloody mess...I would strive to lose everything in order to gain freedom. Well, and further on the film. I probably would have become one of the members of a fight club, and if I hadn't found one, I would have become a lone fighter. But after a while, I'm sure, I was disappointed in all this. But Fight club can be quite good for getting adrenaline, for cleansing from the dirt and routine of everyday life. We are like the hero of the film. We are consumers, a set of attributes, numbers that they analyze. Advertising is targeted for us to sell more goods. Images are imposed on us, and the necessary equipment is added to this image. For example, football players wear Adidas, respectable men wear Swiss watches, and women use Nike. The main character, like those who followed him, is an unhappy man, and he is looking for happiness in self-destruction and destruction of what is next to him - alas, this is the path chosen by many and many young people (especially many young people went down this path in the era of the release of this film), and perhaps the purpose of the film was not to call the viewer to such a life path, but to warn against it.The main thing is that the viewer understands it correctly. The film is ironic."
tt1853728,"I should start by saying that I love Tarantino's other films, and I love westerns. The thought of him making one with such a stellar cast got me giddy with excitement. However, the film left me grossly disappointed.The first third of this film is actually very good. It's exciting, witty, and effectively sets up a relationship between Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz's characters. However, once the 'main' plot kicks in and they begin their rescue, the film stalls considerably. The entire story from this point on is uneven and silly. There are so many unnecessary scenes and the ending in particular is just terrible. It doesn't stand up to the calibre of writing in Tarantino's other films.The acting, on the other hand, is exceptional, and probably saves the film. Everyone does a fantastic job and they deserve the praise they've received. However, this doesn't stop the film's second two-thirds being an uneven mess and with the exception of a hilarious scene featuring Jonah Hill, the film is not the gem everyone seems to be claiming it is. I was honestly convinced I saw a different film to everyone else.It's not an especially bad film; there are witty lines and solid performances. But it's absolutely not worthy of the praise it's received."
tt0114369,"Se7en is a very complex and deep movie, while also being quite disturbing. Andrew Kevin Walker created one of the most original spec screenplays of all time, but it is the kind of story traditionally used more as a writing sample than actually made into a movie. But the creative team of director David Fincher believed in this extremely dark, uncompromising story, and made it just the way Walker wrote it.The story revolves around two extremely well-drawn characters, David Mills (Brad Pitt) and William Somerset (Morgan Freeman). In one sense their relationship is the ultimate clich√© -- the old veteran cop paired up with the brash rookie (though Mills is not actually a rookie, just new to the unnamed city where the movie takes place). But the contrast between these two characters is played out not for laughs or cheap drama but as the real working out of a moral question. Somerset, the lonely, cynical older detective, cares about people but has seen too much of the dark side of life to have much hope for society. Mills is not as intelligent as Somerset (kudos to Pitt for being willing to play a character that frequently looks foolish), and he lives by a simplistic belief in the power of law enforcement to change the world.Throughout the movie, the two characters struggle with this conflict -- is human society basically rotten, and can one person do anything to make a difference? Somerset, an intelligent, well-read man, is smart enough to recognize the truth, however painful that is. Mills is the kind of person who has never truly questioned the simple ""values"" he was raised with. Somerset tries to educate him, tries to warn him, but ultimately fails.In the end, it is only John Doe, the serial killer, who can teach Mills (and by extension the audience) the truth -- that this world is very often shockingly vicious and senselessly cruel. Doe and Somerset actually have similar views of society and the world, up to a point. But while Somerset still cares about his fellow human beings, Doe hates them, and takes out his rage in a series of gruesome murders based on the seven deadly sins.This movie is about the investigation Mills and Somerset undertake of Doe's murders, his ""sermon"" to the world through serial killing. Ultimately, Mills and Somerset can only do so much to try to stop Doe; the killer always seems at least one step ahead of them, and stays that way until the very end of the movie. In a normal Hollywood film, Mills and Somerset would ""win"" in the end by catching Doe and setting the world right again. But Andy Walker had a quite different ending in mind, and Fincher and his team take the shocking conclusion all the way to the limit of tension and drama.This movie, like Fincher's ""Fight Club,"" was controversial for being violent and gruesome. Certainly there are a number of gruesome and disturbing images of murder victims' bodies, and many aspects of the story are very troubling, to say the least. But only one person is shown being killed on screen, and by far the worst of what happens in this story happens in the viewer's imagination. Unlike most films that have high levels of violence -- including, for example, Reservoir Dogs or Silence of the Lambs -- this movie genuinely attempts to grapple with the moral implications of what is being shown on screen. In direct contrast with, say Quentin Tarantino, who uses extreme violence for shock effect and to gain notoriety, Fincher actually shows less violence on screen and raises far more probing moral questions in the viewer's mind. I cannot think of any movie that contains as much genuine debate and discussion among the characters about crime and human morality as this one does -- while never becoming dull or preachy for a moment.I cannot finish this review without a word about Mr. Fincher's extraordinary visual talents. This is a man who ranks with the top handful of directors of all time in his knowledge and grasp of film-making technique. Everything from set design to lighting, selection of film stock and processing techniques, camera movement, frame composition, and editing work together to create an entirely new level of visual brilliance. Fincher's use of technique brings to mind nothing more than the work of Steven Spielberg in the 1970s, the last time a director this extraordinary burst onto the Hollywood scene. A whole generation has passed since then, and there is a new wave of techniques and tools available to the filmmaker of the nineties. Fincher uses every one of these tools to their utmost. The technical work and supporting actors are uniformly superb. This is a movie that works on every level. Andy Walker, having written a mind-blowing screenplay, must have been stunned when he saw the finished film. This movie will rock you to the core."
tt1853728,"Django Unchained (2012)(A second take at the bottom after seeing it again six months later.)What a wild, imaginative, provocative, beautiful, disturbing, excessive, nuanced movie.Is it a masterpiece? Maybe. Or yes, absolutely, as long as you can stomach some of the bloody mayhem. In terms of the core qualities of any ""great"" movie there is no argument here. The story is well told, filled with turns, believable in a fictional way, and entertaining. The acting is superb (or at times incredible). The photography and lighting and editing--the visual basics--are all excellent. The sound and soundtrack (including odd and wonderfully varied anachronistic popular songs) take you by surprise with their validity.The movie is overtly original in that Quentin Tarantino way that is firmly rooted in classic movie-making. It refers to older styles openly, including the ridiculously bold red lettering of the opening credits which are a little like the orange-red lettering of the first widescreen color movies in the mid 1950s. The music at times invokes spaghetti westerns, and the broad landscapes echo that (and in fact the cowboy theme takes us very close to these 1960s movies which Tarantino so loves).So, yes, this is a great movie in all these ways.Can you address the content more directly here? Is this movie about morality, about slavery and justice, about love and walking through fires to achieve it? Yes, of course it is all these things. But, many ask, does it tell the right story about these things? The first answer is, who cares? The director can say what he likes, right? Well, maybe maybe not. He can, of course, but he has to face the music of his critics because in fact movies are not just about cameras and storytelling conventions. They take on meaning, they move people to think, they cause palpable reactions.And so I'll come to the defense of the movie in the simplest ways. First of all, the ambiguity of the main character, the white bounty hunter played by Christoph Walz, is balanced and provocative and without real judgement. He's a cold blooded killer on the path of righteous judgement, a kind of John Brown revolutionary with a hankering for wealth, which he never gets to spend. Likewise the other lead, the black slave played by Jamie Foxx, is both victim and filled with bloody vengeance. It isn't automatically easy to justify everything, but it makes sense on some level, too.I realized when it was all done that the movie pulls off something I hadn't quite seen before--the real horrors of slavery. I think Tarantino ""gets away"" with it because his style is so exaggerated and unreal. The hyper-fable approach makes it possible to be comic and horrifying. If a movie just went ahead with a straight on with torture and brutality to show how bad slavery was, almost like a documentary, it would be unbearable, almost unforgivable. But here we see the worst kind of injustices as part of an approach that at other times forces you out of total verisimilitude, and you cringe and hate it but you go with the flow.Don't mistake things. This is one bloody cruel movie. To make people blow up with more guts and blood than usual so that it's like a comic book death does not make it less bloody. Blood will soak some scenes like graffiti art. And sound effects are used with amazing clarity to emphasize aspects like people's guts flying through the air--or, in a totally opposite way, to hear the searing sound of the ash on a cigarette as someone takes a puff. It's that kind of up and down, deeply thoughtful movie.See it? Of course, if you can stand a little over-the-top violence. It's morally sound, it's exciting and funny and fun and moving. It's beautiful. It's comparable in many ways, formally and in terms of content, to ""Inglourious Basterds."" If you liked that, you'll like this. I thought it amazing through and through. Masterpiece? Why not?Second take: I had a slightly less overwhelming impression this time. It's still a masterpiece of filmmaking, for sure, but some of Tarantino's decisions--what kind of bloody excess, how much to say derogatory words, how to push and pull the plot--seemed slightly contrived. As if his style was forced on the movie, rather than used to further something within the movie. I also watched Inglourious Basterds again recently, and found I still am perfectly amazed by that movie. For now, it's the better of the two (and they have a lot in common structurally, and thematically). Anyway, the rest of what I felt goes. Especially the necessary revulsion. Necessary. A terrific movie."
tt0848228,"The Avengers is quite possibly the most anticipated superhero movie in history, but does it quite live up to the hype?I know that this is the Marvel movie we have all been waiting for. This is the movie that all the others made by Marvel Studios has been leading up to. This is what they have been aching to show us.I was pleased to learn that I would be given the chance to see the movie before its May release date in the United States, but despite my privileged opportunity, I went in with relatively low expectations. (It's just another superhero movie, but with a bunch of them at one time, right?)Wrong...If you are a fan of Marvel, superheroes, great CGI or just all-around intense action films, you MUST see Marvel's The Avengers.The CGI was the best I've seen in a long time, the fighting as intense as ever, and the plot is top-notch. But these things aren't the only aspects of the movie that make The Avengers great. For me, it was the characters.Yes, we've seen all these characters before. We've enjoyed their specific movies, but having them on screen together worked better than I could have imagined.In fact, that was why I was apprehensive at first. I had been afraid that perhaps one hero would take away more screen time than another. (We all have our favorites.) But this wasn't the case.Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.), provided his much expected wit and humor for the film, causing the crowd to laugh on many occasions. The banter between Stark and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) flowed well and added a lot to the character depth.I wasn't sure how Thor (Chris Hemsworth) would be playing his part either. I thought he actually might be taking too much screen time from the others since his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), was the main antagonist, but this wasn't the case.I found myself most excited in the movie when Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) came on screen. His character was done so well for this movie. I found myself thrilled and even scared in some of his scenes.I must also mention here that Ruffalo did a superb job of taking Edward Norton's place as Bruce Banner/ The Hulk. If there's one thing that annoys me about sequels, it's when they change actors, but I actually enjoyed Ruffalo better in this role.Of course you can't forget about Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Each of them played their part of the story wonderfully, though I found Sam Jackson's acting to be a little stale.I would say that if you haven't watched the other movies made by Marvel Studios that you might want to watch them. Most references will be lost on you if you don't.As far as screen time, it felt like every character got their time in the light. No one person stole the show, and just as Marvel intended, they ALL stole the show.There is one particular scene that I enjoyed where the camera panned to each hero, doing their own special moves, though it's hard to explain further than that without giving anything away. However, there were moments in the movie where I had to lean over to my wife and ask what someone was talking about, but these instances were minor.Obviously, if you care anything about Marvel movies, you're already planning to see The Avengers. If you haven't seen any of the other Marvel Studios films, take a weekend, watch them. Then go see The Avengers. I don't think you'll be sorry you did."
tt0120815,"I remember when the hype when SPR was first released: "" Gawd it`s so realistic , it shows the true face of war , it`s like being there man"" I also remember that these claims were made by civilians with no experience of the military or combat ( Maybe the next time a film audience wants to experience the horrors of war, the cinema might like to stick a sniper behind the screen to pick off sundry filmgoers. That would be realistic ) To this day I haven`t heard a single D-Day survivor comment on the realism of this film.Yes I agree that the opening 20 minutes of SPR are outstanding as is the final battle at the end but the outstanding visuals fail to disguise the very average script that is no different from a John Wayne or Errol Flynn star vehicle. There`s very little depth to the story which seems at odds with the anti war visuals.I will defend the film slightly from the allegation of pro American bias. It`s an American film , made by Americans , with American money for a primarily American public. For a more subjective view on the Normandy landings see THE LONGEST DAY , or better still read the book. But the comment on Monty was uncalled for , Bernard Law Montgomery spent 4 years on the western front ( 1914-18 ) he was disgusted by the slaughter he saw there and made needless casualties his main concern. I bet the red army wished for a general like that on the Eastern front. Oh and Monty won the battle of El Alamein , thought I`d just mention it.So just to sum up SPR has some graphic battle scenes overcoming a flawed script. It`s a good film but nowhere near being a masterpiece. Maybe if it`d been set during the Korean war and been a lot more cynical it`d might have been a true classic. But as it is it`s a case of a B movie script saved by a brilliant director"
tt0848228,"I will not make this review very long, but you can add it to anyone else's that gave this a 3 out of 10. First of all, I will say that this film is perhaps the first one (for me ever) that has warranted obtaining it by pirating it from the internet. I could not sleep had I spent $10 at the theater on it, and for that matter $3.00 for a one-evening rental of it on DVD.As I downloaded it, I was really excited, mostly just basing it off the reviews and records it set on its opening weekend and through the summer of 2012 even. And wow, was I so wrong in doing that. Keep in mind, I know that it holds true to form to comic books and their characters depicted in the movie, but I have seen Iron Man, Captain America and the last two Incredible Hulk remakes, and somehow this grouping of all the Marvel characters, diminishes the value of all the characters' individual films they lead in so much its embarrassing. I really liked Iron Man but his one- or two-liners in this film are not funny, but very cheesy and predictable. The costumes on some of the characters are laughably ridiculous, namely Loki his ""ram-looking horns"" or whatever, Hawkeye and his blue contacts and then CGI diminishes all of the others' looks.And finally it speaks enough for itself when this is just one of a very few films I have ever watched where I stopped ( or paused) it every 10 or 20 minutes to go do something else, come back a couple hours later, continue watching,only to repeat the same thing again and again. It took about a day for me to finish it! I mean that just says something of how dull and dopey this film is at times.All the fan-boys who may argue out there, don't please because I obviously realize you are a fan-boy. Anyone else looking for a ""truly good, Oscar-winning, or perhaps classic and one-for-the-history-books"" type of film, look elsewhere."
tt0102926,First its not a thriller.... because it doesn't thrill but just tells a simple story... 2nd... plot holes are way too many to ruin the entire film up...Dr lectarz escape... how can you be so casual with a highly dangerous criminal.... you go in to give food to him.... and no cameras watching over.. wow...Finding the house of buffalo bill... well pretty lucky find i would say... i should be in FBI if it is all to work with luck Killing Him... MY GOD... with the night goggles on watching her from a distance he wouldn't kill her... wouldn't even load the gun beforehand... but would go all the way near her to load the gun so that she can hear it and shoot him... he is the most stupid killer i have ever seen.and without those 3 plot holes... you wouldn't have the end to the story... its like getting stuck with the story and then you don't know how to end it... so you just make luck do all the work and finish of the job... no clues... no thinking... just pure luck and a stupid stupid villain...
tt0108052,"Shindler's List is supposedly Steven Spielberg's greatest achievement, however I cannot say that I agree. Of course there are a lot of good points about the film, it goes without saying that the documentary style and use of black and white gives it a very authentic edge, but it still has its fair share of faults.The main problem with Shindler's List is the length. I'm of the opinion that when watching a film less is more and if you are going to do a film that is over 3 hours long every scene should be as relevant and important as the next one. In Shindler's List, in my opinion, there are many scenes that repeat each other, giving us no new revelation or insight into the character's emotions or actions.It was probably Spielberg's intention to show us so many scenes of torture and abuse of the Jews to help show the horrific scale of the events that took place, to show us how many were killed without emotion or reason, but I feel he got too emotionally involved and went over the top, getting to a point where with each random killing he lessened the impact to the audience because you've seen the same thing happen earlier.Another major problem I have with the film is that some parts come off as strangely comedic, which in my opinion completely goes against the idea of the documentary style. Scenes like when Schindler threatens the guards so they help him find his accountant and when Amon Goeth ""pardons"" himself in the mirror were extremely ill judged as in my opinion you should not be made to laugh in a film that covers such serious subject matter.The film is also very biased in a sense that it gives all the Jews a personality and character development whereas every single Nazi in the film is shown to be pure evil and mechanical, enjoying every last little thing they did. Obviously I am not saying anyone committing these atrocious acts should be absolved from our condemnation and scorn, however it would have been interesting to see how the bosses of the labour camps would have dealt with guards who actually had a moral compass and refused to act upon these orders of such brutality. Not doing this, unfortunately, takes a bit of credibility away from the film as it makes it seem only those who are wealthy, only Schindler, had any respect for the Jews or were against the war.However, despite its faults there is indeed a great deal of tragic beauty to the film. Apart from the scene at the end where Schindler breaks down and cries, which seemed extremely over-acted and quite awkward to watch, the film really does manage to evoke very real emotions. It opens your eyes to the pain and suffering of the Holocaust and gives you a fly-on-the-wall style view into what happened. When you watch from such a close up perspective it really makes you feel that you are there in the film, someone who is standing by and doing nothing to stop the dreadful events that are happening so close to you. This style really helps amplify every emotion you feel to great effect.A lot of credit must also go to the actors. It is key that in a film like this that you believe what is happening on screen and all the actors do a very good job, especially Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern who really manages to capture the emotions of skepticism and hopeless inevitability flawlessly. Liam Neeson does a really good job as Schindler himself, but lets himself down in the final scene where he is just makes you cringe and think ""this is acting"".Overall I found the film very entertaining, but there were a lot of minor quibbles with it that lessened my enjoyment somewhat along with a few major problems that I feel cheapened the overwhelming emotional experience that I received. The film is 100% essential viewing and will definitely stand the test of time, but in my honest opinion is not the masterpiece or the demonstration of perfection that many people laud it to be."
tt0133093,"I have heard so much about the Matrix and finally watched it for the first time this weekend.Boy, were there lots of action sequences. Lots and lots and lots of action sequences. You can feel the filmmakers just trying to top the last sequence instead of doing something like advancing the plot or developing the characters. Unless you think the action sequence is the be-all-and-end-all of movies, all that action just gets boring after a while. I have nothing against whiz-bang special effects as long as they do something worthwhile to move the film along (the Lord of the Rings films are good at this). But this is just not happening with the Matrix.The Matrix concept itself is thought-provoking. Why isn't it developed more? The fact that this monumental struggle for the soul of humanity ends up with a shoot-out, a helicopter-dangling rescue sequence and a martial arts fight is almost laughable. It's like saying the mysteries of the universe can be unraveled by watching beer commercials. If you want to see an ending that leaves you with something worth chewing on, you'll be sadly disappointed (as I was).As for other elements of the movie -- Keanu Reeves, as much as I usually enjoy watching him, was extremely wooden. Fishburne and Moss were good at what they did, but their parts were pretty two-dimensional. I couldn't get emotionally involved with any of the characters, which is ultimately the fault of the writers. The cinematography and ""style"" of the film and the sets is pretty cool to look at. However, the whole black clothes and sunglasses motif is just a little bit hokey after a while. And the agents -- I swear they look just like the bad aliens in Brother From Another Planet -- I kept expecting them to shriek at each other.I look at it this way - people who think that sitting in front of their tubes and playing video games is a worthwhile way to spend their lives will probably love this movie. People who want something more will think it's pretty hollow. It's a shame because the concept had a lot of potential, but the filmmakers took the easy way out."
tt0429078,"""Seven Swords"" is a truly epic wuxia film. Not merely a showcase for the physical talent, this film has a heart and soul. Its themes run deep and leave a lasting impression on the viewer. The story grabs its audience and doesn't let go until everything is resolved. There is not a whole lot to complain about this film. It has a great story and great characters, is artfully thematic, keeps a sense of humor, and still has room for some great fight scenes.This time around Tsui Hark's focusing a little more on characters, sweet action, and a little story development, pushing the film two two-and-a-half-hours. Unlike other long martial arts films, this one somehow never gets boring. Obviously it does have its slow moments, but with the cool fight scenes and interesting characters, you tend to forgot how much time has passed.Set in the early 1600's, the film follows a group of poor villagers as they get the aid of 5 skilled swordsmen to help fight against an evil general and his army of bounty hunters. All of a sudden a new government has been established banning any use of martial arts and evicting anyone who's practicing them. This is rather just in order to prevent any contingency of uprising and the ultimate overthrow of the actual empire. In the vein of the classic 50's Japanese classic Seven Samurai, the skilled swordsmen and a couple brave villagers fend against the army and hope to take down the new law. The plot thickens as we learn that as they flee the village there may be a traitor among them not only leaving clues to the enemy but also is about to impair well-established self-righteousness of the peaceful society. Which brings up the relevant question which unified group of people can survive, their enemy? or the villagers themselves? I was really astonished by what was accomplished here. The romance, characters and extremely well shot action. But what truly caught my attention was the quality and artistic creativity of the quite genius editing. I think to admit that this is just another addition to the previous classic films featuring similar main theme, 7 warriors defending the hapless villagers, i dare to say that this film can rank as the very best of them. Maybe still not on the worldwide scale today but i fairly believe this film will once slowly grow up as one of the greatest masterpieces of the world cinema.If you have a passion for cinema, this film is a gift. If you ""just like going to the movies"", then this film will cure your insomnia. Better to spend your cash on Last Holiday and let true cinema nerds like me take in this masterpiece.Thank you Mr.Hark. I look forward to your next masterpiece... a 15 years from now?!"
tt0993846,"Let's just start of by saying, why didn't Martin win oscar for best director and picture of the year, obviously Leo should've won for best actor and a leading role and Margot Robbie definitely should've won best supporting actress. This is a very fun ride, my sides were aching from all my laughter, the comedy is consistent throughout the whole movie, definitely my favorite film of the decade (no doubt). Jonah Hill's first role that made me realise this man can act, he is hilarious and adds to the film's greatness. The sex scene between Naomi and Jordan is comedy at its' peak, Margot has my favorite female performance of all time. SPOILER TIME: There's a great scene where Jonah Hill's character meets Jordan, claims that he lives in his apartment with two kids and the ""ugly wife"" and this sets up his character, from then on he's absolutely brilliant. One scene which made me laugh so hard I coughed was when Jordan deals with the side effects of ludes and jeez is this scene excellent.Hands down one of my favourite films of all time! Grade: A+"
tt7286456,"While we were at one of the only pre-screenings in my city, it has taken me a while to review this title, because I've been torn on it.Yes, Joaquin Phoenix, who has always been a veritable bastion of talent, was masterful in the role. Yes, Phoenix's portrayal of his character was riveting. Yes, the story was both gripping and also necessary, especially today when it seems that mental illness is running rampant. Yes, the tone was magnificently set within both the cinematic and art direction.What I have a problem with, is the way it tied into the Batman universe and particularly with what it had in common and what differentiated it from the
Jokers of the past. I still have problems making the two worlds merge."
tt0068646,"This movie has to be THE MOST OVERRATED MOVIE OF ALL TIME. i don't understand why everyone raves about this movie. it's boring, the acting is shallow and weak, the whole premise is annoying, and i had to fight off sleep 3 times to finish this ""movie"". This movie has two layers. Boring, barely audible speech, and explosions. I didn't think it to be possible, but even the EXPLOSIONS were boring. Where does the fascination for this movie come from? Marlon Brando may have been a good early actor, but this ""i'll make him an offer he can't refuse"" old man voice is so irritating i almost threw the DVD out the window, however, the movie ended up numbing all my extremities so that it was impossible to move as i had no choice but to sit on in horror. I'm sorry i ever wasted my time on this piece of garbage. With a weak premise, ludicrous character designs, and a plot that could cure insomnia, Godfather sleeps with the fishes, with a 1 out of 10."
tt1130884,"I don't have much to say about this movie at all. I felt that the storytelling was amateurish at best. The scenes were hacked together in such a poor fashion, and the clues to the ending were so blatant. I worked out the premise of the movie about 8-15 minutes in. Sure, I wasn't absolutely certain at that point, but once I reached my conclusion the 'clues' came thicker, faster, and so blatant they were right in my face. After 30 minutes I had no further doubts that I'd nailed it. It's not so much that I'm so awesome at guessing movie plots, but more about how badly put together this story happens to be.Without giving too much away, the initial scene on the boat tipped me off right away that something was off. The scene were they arrive at the island contained some more heavy-handed clues. The dead giveaway though, was the way that later scenes did not fit together coherently. The second or third dream sequence lasted too long for a conventional depiction of a dream, and I felt that we were supposed to lose track of what was real and what was fantasy/dreaming.Overall, I was very disappointed following some rave reviews. This movie has been made before, and it's been made much better."
tt1375666,"It could possibly be Leonardo DiCaprio. That's a bit harsh ‚Äì I know he has to eat too ‚Äì but does he have to always play the same sanctimonious, pedantic, self-righteous know-it-all? And he's been in some bad movies recently. ""Revolutionary Road"" was a potentially good movie, but he always comes off as immature. ""Shutter Island"" was so transparent that I guessed the ending about 10 minutes in. But, this is supposed to be about ""Inception""...Yes, ""Inception"", a movie so simplistic that I yawned throughout. My (lucky) wife fell asleep claiming that it wasn't of interest to her. What claimed to be a smart, intelligent thriller, turned out to be the usual bag of guns, explosions, chases, etc. The plot, paper-thin and without any real point, is a yawn-fest of borrowed ideas and takes liberally from movies we've seen before. Is 10 years really soon enough to remake ""The Matrix"" (with Ellen Page as Neo)? Dennis Quaid in ""Dreamscape"" is far more entertaining. ""Videodrome"" is way more complex and intriguing, a movie that makes the viewer work.While the acting is fair enough for an action flick, there isn't much to say about the movie at all. It's pretty 1-dimensional and quite dumb. What really irks me is the fact that I was told repeatedly about how this movie was so complex, complicated, hard to understand, etc. It's really not. It just uses a nonsensical plot device; that of layered dreaming, to try and outwit the audience. While completely ridiculous ‚Äì isn't a dream within a dream just part of the same dream? ‚Äì it's also not hard to grasp. Is the bar really that low? What would the audience that this bamboozled make of a movie like ""Primer"" which is one of the most complex movies ever devised. Even ""Mission Impossible"" had more plot twists and turns than this drivel.To be honest it was barely just okay. It was boring like a bus-ride through Nebraska. Your mind is the scene of the crime? I didn't see much of any crime - just some folks trying to get a guy to change his mind. Big deal. Michael Caine is even becoming a Director's Trademark. His two minutes on-screen were gratuitous at best, certainly not a requirement to the story.So, to wrap up: boring, simple-minded, dumb, nonsensical plot with no 'science' and barely any 'fiction', less-than-average acting, annoying constant music while people are talking, convenient 'get-outs' when the logic of the story fails, which is frequently. Wow, I actually think I hate this movie."
tt7286456,"Still days after seeing it, I'm still stunned by this film. I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who's watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don't see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.
The film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy"" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese's best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from ""Taxi Driver"" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from ""The King of Comedy"".
The film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child's hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn't know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother's house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I'm not gonna go any further into plot details since the film's not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn't have the name ""Joker"" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don't get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.
Although I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That's probably my only negative with this film.
But still; it's a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to ""The Killing Joke"" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!
I'm gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix's greatness and even Robert De Niro's acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it's amazing. I can't wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76"
tt1130884,"I just saw Shutter Island this evening, just prior to its American release. I have to say this film was full of intrigue. Prior to viewing this film I had built a preconceived notion of what this thriller was going to be like because I was fooled yet again by good marketing when watching the trailer. This is probably not the movie for your average film-goer who wants an easy plot line to follow and little thought required. This movie does challenge the viewer physchologically and definitely holds your attention all the way through. For someone who was never much of a Leonardo fan, his performance is brilliant, so much range to his character. In fact all of the acting in this film is excellent. The directing is probably the best quality to this film. I always enjoy watching a film that is as unpredicatable as this film and where the director has turned the plot line on to his viewer."
tt0110912,"Well my first review just accidentally got deleted so here is for a second go of it.. Pulp Fiction has an excellent ability to interweave multiple dissimilar narratives into one cohesive story. It has a knack for balancing tense, dramatic moments with witty, comedic relief. Scenes such as the pawn shop basement with Zed, the hit men's clothing change after hiding a body with the Wolf, and Captain Koons' monologue showcase Tarantino's warped sense of humor."
tt0172495,This movie is one of the greatest films I have ever watched and what makes it more interesting is that the shooting was in my hometown Ouarzazate and I assisted in the making of this masterpiece
tt1375666,"This movie was terrible. It tried to be something ground breaking and emotionally challenging, but fell terribly short on all fronts, starting with the basic premise. I am expected to believe that a group of people smart enough to construct an elaborate plot involving breaking into other people's dreams are not smart enough to reunite a man with his family without getting stopped at customs? That's stupid. Fly to Mexico and walk. Or fly the kids to you. This giant plot hole is unfathomably stupid, as is most of the dialogue in this two and a half hour nightmare. I think my personal favorite line in the movie was when DiCaprio's character told his dream wife that he could not do her justice because he could not remember all of her perfections and all of her imperfections. You can't have both stupid. This movie is probably mindblowingly deep and meaningful if your education stopped in grade school, but if you have a least a GED, don't waste your ten bucks."
tt0993846,"An old adage goes that if on a certain day, everyone in the world received a million dollars, by the end of the day, ten percent of the people would have all the money.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" pretty much shows how that could happen.Based on Jordan Belfort's book, this is a very entertaining movie - although probably not for those who lost their money. The film follows Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) from newbie stockbroker to head of Stratton Oakmont, the largest 'Over The Counter' stockbroking firm in the US.Along the way he has two marriages, acquires luxury homes and automobiles, a sea going yacht with a helicopter, a taste for wild office sex parties, which would put a Roman orgy to shame, and a huge drug habit. But even after the FBI steps in and everything unravels, the guy still can't help making money.The movie is loud, lewd and often hilarious; it doesn't have a boring minute.Matthew McConaughey gives a brief but telling performance as Mark Hanna who initiates Belfort into the darker side of Wall Street. He also introduces the tribal chest-thumping chant that becomes a motif throughout the film.Aussie Margot Robbie is hard to take your eyes off as Belfort's second wife, Naomi. She was also an amusing guest on talk shows when the movie was released where she told how she pulled off the Brooklyn accent, and kept the news about her nude scenes from her family for as long as possible.But this is Leonardo's movie. Although in his portrayal of Belfort, where there appears to be almost no moral or ethical boundaries, he keeps our sympathy because he can actually laugh at himself; it's a high energy performance, but with a light touch.In a way, the performance has echoes of the one he gave for Spielberg in ""Catch Me If You Can"". Despite the fact that both Jordan Belfort and Frank Abagnale Jr. break the law, their sheer audacity dazzles us. Also, both Spielberg and Scorsese have great comedic timing; they know how to deliver a punch line. If you were looking for a reason why this film works better than Scorsese's ""The Aviator"", which also starred Leonardo, it could simply be the latter film's lack of humour - Hughes was eccentric but he wasn't funny.Enjoyable as ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is, at the end you can't help wondering if even half of it is true, how it is that with people like Belfort and his friends helping themselves to such over-sized slices of the pie, that the world's economy hasn't descended to the level it did in 1929. In a way, it's actually a very scary movie."
tt0397103,"This is a wonderful movie. There are no sets or ""hollywood"". It is real and sincere... I would like to see more movies that have this kind of compassion and message.It is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The characters are well thought-out and are represented well by the actors. Mika Boorem plays the part of Katie as a self-involved teenager that has it all. It is interesting to see how she transforms into someone whose mission it is to help someone else. The children that she is involved with have a terrific impact on outlook. I would only hope that this message reaches all those that see it.The director and producers have something going. I hope to see more of the ideas of Dark Forest. And, how interesting is it that most of the filming was done in China. Nice job!"
tt0120815,"I will be blunt 2 out of 10. The only people who will rave about this are Americans who have won this war but the First and every other war that has happened (just watch U-571 if you don't believe me and to think in really life and not films it was the British that got the Enigma machine!). Steven Spielberg I would just like to say how believable the first half an hour was with the scenes on the beach. Someone as young as me can only imagine the horrors of what those brave men (that is British, Australian, French, Dutch etc) went through in both World Wars (to me and the trenches of the First would be the most horrific). These behind the scenes men would not care about one person and other men could not be spared to go and find him! I know for a fact they do not as my Great Grandmother had to endure something similar in the First World War! I also wonder if these script writers do any research or care about history? The answer is no."
tt0172495,"Yes I was entertained Maximus. Plenty of realistic sword fighting duels, compared to most action films anyway, with an immense storyline that makes you passionate about supporting Maximus in avenging his family. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix suit the roles perfectly as hero and villain, with a simple yet effective story that keeps you engaged. There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself. I feel like injured or not, no one in their right mind would've taken the decision to fight him 1 to 1, so for a cunning character, I feel he made an unrealistic decision there, but it did make for a very entertaining finish."
tt0468569,"i loved the previous Batman film,Batman Begins.i thought it was brilliant,possibly the best superhero movie ever made.and with stratospheric hype this newest film had,combined with the trailers i had seen,i knew i had to see it.many people commented that it more than lived up to the hype,so i expected something earth shattering.to say i was disappointed is an understatement.there were moments where i was bored,and hoped it would end soon.Batman's voice in this movie annoyed me.it sounded like he had swallowed a bucket of gravel.either that,or had a bad case of laryngitis.maybe there was a reason behind this.but all it did was annoy me.as for Heath Ledger,and his performance as The Joker,i found it OK,but i wouldn't say it was award worthy.i mean no disrespect by this.when the movie finally ended and i left the theatre,neither the the character of The Joker,or any aspect of the movie stayed with me.bottom line,i didn't find anything profound in this movie.i was massively disappointed.it doesn't even touch Batman Begins,in my opinion.for me,The Dark Knight is a 5/10."
tt0110912,"I was tempted to stop watching it about four times. I went up to the end just to see if, at least, there is something extraordinary or unexpected there. I really can't understand what all these viewers found to this film, to score it so high. It's the first time (or the second I'm not sure!) that I get into the mood of writing a review. The reason, I guess, is because this film is the fifth in the top 250 ranking and I couldn't see why. The curiosity of the ranking was also the reason of watching it at the first place. There is a high end casting and a top level director but nothing more, IN MY OPINION. I tried looking it through the eyes of 1994 but still compared to other productions of the age is far behind. If you find yourself in the position wondering whether to watch this film or not, due to its place in the list¬Ö don't waste your time!"
tt0167260,"If you enjoy the trilogy, you'll enjoy this movie."
tt0468569,"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want."
tt0109830,"I remember loving this movie, and I thought I would enjoy watching it again all these years later, but I felt just the opposite. It was so oversimplified and the character did not feel authentic as much as caricature. This is not a reflection on Tom Hanks who did a beautiful job, but just the script itself. There are so many other movies with people who have mental challenges (such as I am Sam for example) that did not strike me as caricature so I was surprised and disappointed watching this again 20 years later to find it actually turned my stomach more often than not.It's hard to believe it won all those Oscars too. Yes, it's filmed beautifully and it has some interesting moments reflecting back over history, but it really feels clich√© nowadays. I guess at the time it was an out of the box inspirational kind of movie but now it's really not very politically correct in today's society..."
tt0816692,"It's not really a good Sci-fi, you take away the wormhole and replace the setting with WW2 Japan, where a father has to go on a suicide mission and there you have it. Melodramatic and not really reflective of humanity as a whole, or our place in the Universe. The film contemplates nothing significant and manages to tell nothing. Basically a cheap tearjerker for USA audience, cashing in on dwindling patriotism.Protip: if you want good Sci-Fi films try either Sunshine or Pandorum. They are infinitely more entertaining and closer to reality without making paradoxes left and right. Or heck even Solaris if you're really that into melodrama.I'm really disappointed in Nolan, after confused and often mind-twisting films like Inception and The Prestige, Nolan seems to be transforming into another side of Michael Bay where all Those millions are more important than integrity."
tt0120815,"I was originally going to give this move 6 stars, but I thought hard about it and this movie had it's ups and downs for me. The start of the movie kind of made me a little annoyed I felt like I was getting sea sick watching the first part and there was too much going on all at once. I was confused a little bit too because the old man at the grave. This movie was kind of funny though towards the middle and Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors too. I know I'm saying a lot of things right now but I liked this movie though regardless of the beginning of it. I recommend this movie to people who like a lot of stuff happening all at once and also war movies."
tt1130884,"I really wish I knew who to ask to get my money back from. This was the biggest waste of time, red vines, popcorn, and human effort. If you wait until this movie comes out on cable you will still be upset that you wasted your time watching it. My girlfriend got angry at me for taking her to this awful movie. She was in such a bad mood after we saw this terrible film that we had no sex. It didn't matter though because my sex drive has been killed by looking at dead babies floating in a lake, holocaust victims, and bad acting. I have never seen an entire crowd of people exiting a theater more bummed out. If you are thinking of going to see this movie, take some money out of your wallet and throw it in the street. It will be more satisfying and take less time."
tt0361748,"This wartime movie follows two separate stories that are destined to meet in the final scenes. In the first Col. Hans 'The Jew Hunter' Landa enters a French farm house and, after talking to the farmer for some time, shoots the Jewish family he was hiding; one of them, eighteen year old Shosanna, manages to escape. When we next see her it is 1944 and she is running a cinema in Paris. Here she catches the eye of a young German soldier; she isn't interested in him but it turns out he is famous amongst the Germans thanks to his exploits as a sniper. A film has been made about him and he wants the premiere to take place in her cinema with all the top brass in attendance¬Ö she sees this as an opportunity to avenge her family's murder. Meanwhile the second story follows a small group of Jewish American soldiers, nicknamed the 'Inglourious Basterds', who are working deep inside enemy territory killing any Germans they can get their hands on. When British Military Intelligence learns of the film premiere this group are brought into a plot to blow up the cinema with the help of a German actress, Bridget von Hammersmark, who has been working as a double agent. As the big night approaches it emerges that Adolf Hitler himself will be in attendance along with other senior Nazis¬Ö if everything goes to plan the war could end in 1944.If you like your war stories to fit in with real history you might find this rather annoying as some real people who did not die in 1944 end up dead in this film¬Ö if however you are looking for a cracking war film with a good amount of action, some very tense scenes and a spectacular finale you could do a lot worse than this. The film opens more like a spaghetti western than a war film with the Germans arriving at a remote farmhouse. Here Landa and the farmer just talk for the first twenty minutes of the film¬Ö the tension gradually rising as we wait for something to happen. Christoph Waltz is delightfully menacing without ever issuing a direct threat or raising his voice; in this scene and for most of the movie. After this prologue things get more interesting as we switch between the two plots to kill Nazis at the cinema; at any time either could be exposed or they could somehow ruin the other's scheme. Given that Tarantino's previous films are pretty bloody I expected this to be very violent but it isn't excessively; there are indeed moments of violence but more often there is just the feeling that something violent is about to happen; when it does it is short and bloody. The cast do a fine job; as well as the aforementioned Christoph Waltz there are great performances from Brad Pitt as the leader of the titular 'Inglourious Basterds', M√©lanie Laurent as Shosanna and Diane Kruger as Bridget von Hammersmark. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of Tarantino's earlier films as well as people looking for a thrilling war movie."
tt0468569,Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.
tt0120815,"Seeing it again, nine years after its release, you can't help being struck by how familiar things are: the pale blue cast of the photography, the distinctive special effects, the squib charges exploding not with blood but with dust when a man is hit, the clank of bullet against armor, the shaky camera, the enemy seen as dark phantoms scurrying through the murk of the battlefield, the tiny fountain of cork chips as a bullet slams into the dirt, the attention to period detail, the necessity of reloading at particularly awkward moments.All of this is familiar now because it's been so often aped, often in strong films like ""Band of Brothers"" and ""Blackhawk Down"". I doubt that anyone could make an ""ordinary"" war film anymore. Slow, cheap ones like Sam Fuller's or even innovative grunt's-view stories like ""Platoon."" If you're going to make a war movie now, Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" is the bogie you have to match. It is the fate of rebels to found orthodoxies.And what an innovation this movie was. Oliver Stone must be applauded for tackling a subject like the Vietnam war that was so controversial that the conflict was avoided for more than ten years, because of the still smoldering emotions the war had generated. If Vietnam had been a human being it would have had to stalk around dressed in rags, tinkling a little bell, and crying ""Unclean, unclean."" ""Saving Private Ryan""'s subject is less controversial. First, the enemy really WAS our enemy. (Germany declared war on the USA first, not the other way around.) Second, well -- we won, didn't we? But it is probably more original in its details. And candid too. A German and an American soldier are locked in bitter mano a mano conflict, and the German wins! And not by cheating either! He is the bigger man and finally overpowers the American and inch by inch sinks the American's own bayonet into his chest. He does not gloat or smile. It's no tennis game to the German, but a deadly necessity, just as it is for the American soldier. ""Relax,"" the German pants in a low voice, ""it's very simple,"" as the tip of the knife slowly penetrates the American's chest. The scene is phenomenally stark.The most complex character is Upham's. The rest of the Americans play their assigned roles, performing impossible feats of bravery. This is precisely what the Germans are doing too. But Upham fails at a crucial point and costs the lives of his allies. The viewer can sit back and make Olympian judgments about Upham's character, but consider that for every hour Upham spent in combat he was as valiant as everyone else for fifty-five minutes. He translated, was almost run over by a tank, ran across open spaces under fire, and carried ammunition. But those fifty-five minutes don't count on his side, only the five during which he was frozen in tonic immobility, a fundamental mammalian trait which -- not having been in Upham's place ourselves -- we can condemn him for.Maybe nobody can define an ""anti-war movie."" They ALL claim to be anti-war movies. How could you possibly market a PRO-war movie unless we were formally at war with another nation? To many people, an anti-war movie is a simple excuse to give us more action and more blood. Put Steven Segal in combat boots. Others are anti-war because they give us a glimpse of the enemy's humanity somewhere along the line. But in all the anti-war movies we always seem to win, as indeed we do in ""Saving Private Ryan"". (The cavalry comes galloping to the rescue.) All war movies, even those depicting a ""defeat"" like Pearl Harbor, seem to endorse the same bumper-sticker slogan: ""No matter how sneaky or noble they may be, they can't whip us."" I guess it takes an enormous amount of courage -- in Hollywood -- to ask an audience to pay money to see a movie in which we lose a war or a battle or a fist fight with an enemy. It's what I admire about a movie as flawed as ""A Bridge Too Far."" And it's what makes me feel more involved in the tragedy shown in ""Saving Private Ryan."" That hand-to-hand fight that the American loses contravenes established war narratives. What? We LOSE? It's as shocking as Hitchcock's killing of Janet Leigh half-way through ""Psycho."" Don't miss ""Saving Private Ryan,"" a milestone at the time."
tt0139414,"""Lake Placid"" could have been so much better. Steve Miner has recycled so many cliches from this genre that even the scenes that make you jump are so predictable.Four excellent actors are wasted. Brendan Gleeson, superb in ""The General"", has lost his Irish brogue and speaks with a perfect American accent. He is the sheriff who is investigating the death of his deputy who has been brutally bitten in half by a giant alligator. Bridget Fonda is the paleontologist imported from New York to aid in the investigation. Bill Pullman is charge of the investigation. Oliver Platt is the millionaire alligator enthusiast who horns in on the proceedings. David E. Kelley, who has written some of the best scripts on television (The Practice, Ally McBeal),  probably wrote this fiasco on a weekend vacation. Some of the dialogue is funny. Betty White is given some blue language which seems humorous coming out of her mouth. The opening sequence is right out of ""Jaws"". Steven Spielberg should sue. The alligator is realistic and the gore is gross enough. It's just the characters who are cardboard and unworthy of David E. Kelley's imagination."
tt0120815,"Without looking, I am sure other reviewers here have headlined their article ""Best War Movie Ever Made"""" and I agree. However, before briefly discussing the film, let me just say if you don't have a decent 5.1 surround sound system, you aren't going to fully appreciate this movie (DVD).It's a great film to start with, and sitting in a room surrounded by five speakers with bullets flying from all directions around you - as in that spectacular 22- minute opening scene or in the final 45 minutes of action against the Germans in tanks - is an astounding movie experience. The sound in this film elevates it even higher.The visuals are outstanding, too. I've never seen so many grays, beiges and olive-greens look this good: perfect colors for the bombed-out French city where the last hour takes place, perfect for the faces and uniforms of the gritty soldiers, for the machinery, the smoke-filled skies, etc.My only complaint is the usage of Lord's name in vain 25-30 times, but, hey, when you consider it's tough men in tough times, that's what you are going to hear. In real life, the profanity probably was worse than the film.It's hard to picture the brutality of war being any worse than you see here, but it probably was. This is about as graphic as it gets. The violence and gore was shocking when this film came out in 1997 and still is when watched almost a decade later. It's unbelievable what some of the WWII soldiers went through, but that can be said for any war. I believe the purpose of this film was to pay tribute to the sacrifices these men made, and it succeeds wonderfully. Hats off to Steven Spielberg and to Tom Hanks, the leading actor in here, both of whom have worked hard for WWII vets to get the recognition they deserve, not just on film but in a national memorial.Anyway, language or blood and guts aside, this is still an incredible portrait of WWII. The almost-three hour film is riveting start-to-finish, especially with that memorable beginning action scene, probably the most dramatic in the history of film.As ""entertaining"" as those action scenes were, I found the lulls, if you will, to be even better. Listening to Hanks and his men discuss various things as they look for Private Ryan, was fascinating to me. Hanks is just superb in here and once again shows why he is considered one of the best actors in his generation.The most memorable and powerful moment among the ""lulls,"" is the shot early on of the Ryan mother sinking to her knees on her front porch as she realizes she is about to get disastrous news from the war. Moments later, Harve Presenell, playing Gen. MacArthur, eloquently reads a letter by Abraham Lincoln that is so beautifully written, so profound that it is quoted near the end of the film, too, and I never get tired of hearing it.This is a man's movie, and shows the horrors of war as few others ever have. To say it is ""memorable,"" just doesn't do it justice. It is the greatest war movie ever made....period."
tt0993846,"I didn't like it, I've seen the hedonist-to-riches-to-rags story before, as in the bigger they rise the harder they fall, yada, yada, yada....If they're going to make a movie that pushes the envelope, which this movie does, moviegoers should have as much warning as possible as to what they are about to endure. Sure, some people might think that ""It's a Scorsese movie, you know what you're getting into,"" and for some people that's true, but there are people who don't research every movie they go to, and who feel they usually get enough information from a preview, or they decide to go spontaneously. More upbeat: the movie had some good irreverent humour.At the rate of moral decay on screen, we will be watching porn on the big screen in just a few years now. My feeling on the matter is that I can stay at home and jerk off to porn for free, so why do I want to pay money to go see porn in the theatre."
tt0110912,"OK. I'm certainly not going to bother to waste my time, or yours, here by ranting and raving away about what a frickin' over-rated (that's right - OVER-RATED!) picture that I, most definitely, think that Pulp Fiction is.All that I'll say on the matter is that I have never, ever heard so many stupid conversations going on (on a continual basis) as I have heard going on in this film, bar none. It's true.And out of all of these brain-dead conversations that took place the most brilliant ""factoid"" brought to my attention was that in France, at their McDonalds, they actually (get this!) put mayonnaise on their french fries.(Gasp!)Oh-me! Oh-my! Those uncouth, bohemian, Parisian parasites have no class at all!Uh.... Need I say more?"
tt0109842,"One thing I liked about ¬®Fresh¬® is how the main character was a young boy when most of the conflict was about drugs,because it gave me a different perspective.Another thing I liked about ¬®Fresh¬® is that it's about a realistic life situation. Lastly a thing i liked about ¬®Fresh¬® is that the main character barely knew his father but still played chess with him,which shows that even if he walked out on him he still cares for him.One thing that annoyed me was that they never showed what happened after Michael got rid of all the bad guys.Another thing that annoyed me was that it never showed us what became of Michael, for example if he stopped selling drugs or what. One way ¬®Fresh¬® was realistic is the fact that some kids in brooklyn actually go through this, where they sell drugs to get through life.I think i'am qualified to give this review because i was raised in Brooklyn and know many kids that go through what the main character of ¬®Fresh¬® went through.I give credit to the director for making a decent movie that many can relate to."
tt1130884,"Sure everyone knows the typical Scorsese film. Normally there is a mob present, or in most cases, a tough brute who loves to flash the ""F"" bomb in almost every sentence. But what about a thriller? I mean sure, we have seen it in ""Cape Fear"", probably one of my personal favorite remakes. But what about a top notch mind bending thriller that really makes you think. Something the likes of which we have never seen Mr. Scorsese do. But given his previous works of art, its really hard to doubt that he cannot pull this off.Grasping the concept of this movie is a no brainer. There is a mystery on this island filled with crazy people, but you can tell that there is a lot more under the surface. Yeah, it doesn't sound that original........but my oh my, you just wait until Scorsese begins to pick at your brain. Not since ""Taxi Driver"" have i seen Scorsese really make a valiant attempt at a character study of someone going insane. In ""Taxi Driver"", its like your in the back seat......watching as Robert Deniro slowing progresses into his insanity. With Shutter Island, its like your inside the mind of Dicaprio, and everything is starting to crumble. Scorsese really does a fantastic job of toying with your mind. You cannot help but second guess everything your thinking, but then again, i think that was the ultimate goal.......and yes, that was hint towards the end, which i think will raise a lot of debate. Now i always hear the phrase ""Twist and Turns"" when someone describes a decent thriller. Then i see the movie, and i say to myself........""That was a Twist and Turn? It felt more like a road bump."" But in this case, Scorsese really does re-define the term. Because in this film, you really have a hard time judging what is actually real, and what is not.......and what you think is happening, is actually not happening at all..........that is a twist and turn people. Not you finally figuring out who the masked killer is at the end.......okay, im sorry that all thriller movies are not like a Scooby Doo episode.And since we are on the subject of crappy thrillers......i am so glad that Scorsese chose not to use elevated music in some of scenes. For example, someone jump out of a dark corner......in most cases, the music is raised and the audience jumps.......but in this movie, Scorsese doesn't add any music at all......he just uses the fear of an eerie set to make your skin crawl. Much like an old Hitchcock movie. However, there is music in this, and let me tell you, it is so very fitting. You can tell Scorsese has been down this path before, so he sort of used the same style that he did in ""Cape Fear"", with Benard Herman's deep, dark, and haunting tones that just pull you in more and more. Honestly, there is not one bad aspect of this movie. The acting, the directing, the score, the cinematography.....all pieced together with one hell of a script.Bottom Line........people, this is what a thriller is suppose to be. Especially a psychological thriller. I thank god for directors like Scorsese.....because this movie really isn't his type of film. My guess is he saw enough crap in this genre' and had enough.......so he threw his hat into the ring and gave a rebirth to the classic Hithcock type thriller.......not only that, i really think that he redefined it in a way. Now i know that it is really early in the year, but i can easily see this movie staying in my top 10 of this year. Absolutely fantastic film, best i have seen so far."
tt0313792,"I saw an advance screening of Woody Allen's new film ""Anything Else"" last Tuesday. I have to admit that I am a huge Woody Allen fan...a very devoted fan. ""Manhattan"" was my introduction to Woody's work, and although I knew who Woody Allen was, it wasn't until my exposure to ""Manhattan"" that I realized he was certainly ""my kind of guy."" I've seen most of his films now, and prior to tonight I thought that his last truly 'great film' was 1992's ""Husbands and Wives"" (Allen's films since then haven't been great, even though I certainly think they've been very good). When I heard a few months ago that a new Woody Allen movie was coming out, I got excited. I was anticipating it's release because I've never seen a Woody Allen film on the big screen.When I saw the trailer for ""Anything Else,"" which is being marketing as an upbeat hip teenage film, I knew that the film's publicity was marketing it that way with the soul purpose to draw a broad audience (the character Woody is playing is very important in the story, and Woody's face isn't anywhere to be found in the trailer). This has happened to a movie before (""Monkeybone"" being a prime example), so of course it didn't stop me.As for my feelings on ""Anything Else,"" I'm immensely delighted that Woody Allen has delivered a terrific romantic and witty film about relationships (a genre he hasn't taped into in a long time, and also the genre he is absolutely best at). Jason Biggs, whom I've always had a certain fondness for but who has never been in anything I've had a desire to watch, is teriffic as Jerry, a comedic writer who is struggling with his relationship with Amanda (Christina Ricci). So much of this movie echos real life, and I feel Woody had something to say here and does it. And this is Woody Allen's best performance as an actor in years. He is eerily insecure, absolutely hilarious, and downright perfect as the character Dobel, Jerry's friend and fellow comedy writer.I like the way the characters are dressed, and the cinematography is great (""quintessential Woody""). Also, I felt the ending and what happens to the characters was a graceful way to wrap up the story (I was a satisfied as I was with graceful wrap-up of ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"").It is important to note that I was sitting with a very diverse audience (it was great, so many different kinds of people I felt like I was in a Fellini movie), including many teenagers, and I would think many teenagers would consider ""Anything Else"" dull and sparse compared to the mainstream, I was delighted that most of them appeared to be absorbed in the film. It was great to hear teenage girls laughing at the many little quirks of Woody's character Dobel. Maybe as the result of Dreamworks' marketing, a whole new generation of Woody Allen fans will be born?All in all, an impressive new film from Woody Allen. I had a lot of fun. I will certainly buy a copy when it is released on DVD."
tt0816692,"I'm not going to review the movie, but I will review the flawed/easily manipulated Rating system this site has become. As I write this, the movie supposedly has over 12000 independent movie-going-public votes - even though the general release of the movie in the U.S. is not until tomorrow and the international release is occurring now. And, apparently, well over 11000 of those votes gave this movie a 10 out of 10 rating because the overall rating is 9.3 - that would mean that not only is Interstellar the best movie ever made in the history of cinema, but it is far and away the best movie ever made and movies such as The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, etc. are only average by comparison. There are two other possibilities. The first is these 12000 voters have seen only a few movies and they were so bad that this one seemed perfect by comparison. Or the entire voting process is manipulated by filmmakers to produce artificially high ratings to dupe potential ticket buyers. Spoiler Alert: It's not the best movie ever made."
tt0068646,"What a boring movie.How can such a movie be rated that high?
Will always be a secret to me."
tt0109830,"In Philadelphia Hanks played a gay man dieing of AIDS fired because of his sexuality. It took courage to take the part and Hanks used to to open the heats and minds minds of many viewers. When I first saw Gump I thought it was sentimental and cloyingly sweet. After talking to a friend who works with the handicapped my impression changed. Underneath the sugar coating the movie presents the idea that if people with IQs below 90 wanted to they could get into the army (Gump would never have gotten into the army), be war heroes, start successful businesses and become rich. It makes believable the idea that these people need no help from the rest of us. Hanks is cute, beguiling and an altogether 'lovable little retard'. The image it presents of real handicapped people who struggle to get by in our world is callous and degrading."
tt1853728,"This film is shameful on several levels. First, it disgustingly violent. Second, it glorifies violence. Third, it shows violence as funny. Fourth, it is outrageously racist- every white (other than a German) is sinister, and most are stupid. Fifth, this racism is used to justify the first three points. Sixth, while some of the plot twists are clever, several are just ridiculous, and covered by the typical device of moving so quickly that you don't have time to consider how improbable they are. Other than the foregoing, it is pretty good- fast-paced and sometimes funny. But how can anyone be so desensitized that he/she does not appreciate how offensive and dangerous this is? There is more to life than entertainment."
tt0167260,"I was rather hyped for the third part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, as I suppose everyone was. Unfortunately, I found it boring and lacklustre. The Return of the King barely exhibited the epic quantity that I awaited from the finale of the trilogy. It seems that by this time, the whole crew was tired of the project. Also, the omissions and changes to Tolkien's original are most glaring in RotK. The movie just whizzed by and I failed to be impressed. Maybe the Extended Edition would prove to be a more rousing experience. The normal edition, however, despite its efforts, remains a lacking ho-hum finale to what began as an impressive filmatization of the Lord of the Rings tale."
tt0120815,"When I read the first ten comments I was shocked how easily the audience accepts everything it gets served by names like Spielberg. The only positive exception I saw is Mark Welch.When I saw the first 40 minutes I was really surprised how realistic Spielberg's pictures and the plot were. After they took the beach he produced just another one of those average ""let 10 Americans beat the German army"" movies.Why did it have to be a set-up like that: It was not just 200 infantrists + 10 tanks vs 20 GI's (of course none was black!), but the WaffenSS, the German elite troops, which had quite some fighting experience from Russia. It was the same plot than hundreds before. Let the idiots take the main road, we attack from the sides.What would have happened: - the church tower would have been blown up before any Germans would have entered the town, as snipers are not that new - a small group of German soldiers would have checked the town - ...So, I probably saw 2 movies on the same day, the best and the worst war movie of the year. It doesn't surprise me, that the good part, was just a visually great set-up of a fixed plot, whereas when Spielberg was writing the story, it turned out to be worst rubbish. If you want to see a good war movie, take Full Metal Jacket, or Platoon."
tt0993846,"Yeah, I'm a business major and this is my favorite movie of all time."
tt0102926,"In THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a young, idealistic FBI trainee sent in to consult on a case with Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant but diabolical therapist who's been caged for eight years. Clarice's quarry is a mystery slayer tagged with the nickname ""Buffalo Bill,"" because the victims -- all plus-sized women -- turn up partially skinned. Lecter won't cooperate with the veteran FBI agents on using his Sherlock Holmes-like powers (and some insider info) on figuring out Buffalo Bill's whereabouts. But Clarice appeals to the deadly doctor, who feeds the young woman vital clues in trade for personal details about the wounds in her own past."
tt0102926,"UPDATE: I recently began watching the TV show, ""Hannibal"", and although I also think it's way too graphic, I much prefer Mads Mikkelson's version of Dr. Lecter. It's much, much more subtle and creepy--without the over the top theatrics of the movie version of the guy."
tt1130884,"First, I know many who read this will not take the time to research what I'm saying to see that it is true and further, many won't have the ability to see it even if they did. So, I know this review will be thumbed down by those who don't like the hard truths in life but this movie (or should I say novel by Dennis Lehane) was a nice piece of plagiarism based upon a 1920 silent film called The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.The same basic plot exists in both as well as the exact same twist ending. The lead character investigates an insane asylum and tries to put clues together to figure out the mystery surrounding the place but as we near the end, we learn that the lead character isn't there to investigate anything. He's an inmate there who has invented much of what he was investigating as part of his coping mechanism.Shutter Island would have been a good movie if it hadn't ripped off The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari so blatantly. Lehane obviously knew that the old movie was in the public domain but instead of telling the viewers that it was based on that movie, they just pass it off as his (and/or Scorseesi's idea). That, my friends, is the definition of plagiarism.I don't recommend this whatsoever for this reason. It is a shame and Lehane should be called on it but who will do it? Too much $ to be made reheating the old dishes and calling them made from scratch.Watch The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (it's on y o u t u b e if you want to compare the two and see that what I'm saying is 100% correct).I almost never write reviews but this time, I had to."
tt0110912,"This movie has good film editing and a really good storyline. This movie is really good but not a cult movie or a great movie. Everything is just clear. It has amazing style to tell the story. But the contents in the movies are really cheap.It has some awkward scenes. They are cleaning the car in 30 minutes. Okey it brings realistic style but the whole movie is already realistic, no need to waste 30 minutes."
tt0167261,"A surprisingly bland and childish adaptation of Tolkien's legendary epic. I felt I was watching a Disney film. The talents of Lee and McKellen are wasted here. Jackson has already shown with ""Fellowship"" -- a superior film -- that he understands Tolkien and knows how to translate his works to the big screen. But with ""The Two Towers"" he takes literary license too far. Skateboarding elves and wisecracking dwarves, is that all it takes to defeat the Uruk-hai? What gives with Aragorn and the pseudo love triangle? These are distractions. Oh, and how about putting some emotional impact back into the story? I want to empathize with the main characters. Still, I'd forgive all its defects in a heartbeat if wasn't so boring. 6/10"
tt0102926,"Not so long ago, I was involved in a debate to decide what the best film of all time was. Not necessarily my favourite or the most re-watchable, but just the best film. Somehow, after a drink, a few arguments and a lot of contemplation, I singled out The Silence of the Lambs. The question remains though... was I actually onto something?The Silence of the Lambs follows agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is desperate to apprehend the serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). To try and help her gain insight into the mind of a psychopath, the aspiring agent must consult the genius, yet sinisterly manipulative psychiatrist turned cannibal, Doctor Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins). From the very first scene, Silence of the Lambs' genius is obvious. During the opening credits, with eerie music displaced on top, the camera follows Clarice, with almost stalker-like intent, as she completes a training course in an initially empty forest. This immediately founds a cruel feeling of fear, dread and unease that continues to build throughout the film... though there are noticeable spikes during any visits to the film's most infamous character.Hannibal Lector - ""A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti.""The Silence of the Lambs is one of three films in history to win the big 5 awards at the Oscars (best picture, actress, actor, screenplay and director) and the reason for those wins is thanks in large part to every and any scene involving Clarice's interaction with the eponymous Hannibal Lector. Imagine, Heat's diner talk, The Dark Knight's interrogation, or The Godfather's meetings. This is the level Silence of the Lamb's interviews are at. With closeups of both characters faces capturing their psychological chess game in exquisite detail, both actors are at the top of their games and refuse to provide respite for their entranced audience. Jodie Foster perfectly encapsulates the intelligent, ambitious yet emotionally delicate Starling who along with Anthony Hopkin's now iconic portrayal of the psychopathic Lector create a pairing so iconic that their interactions have been parodied to no end (references range from The Batman to Stranger Things to even Tom and Jerry).Hannibal Lector - ""And what did you see, Clarice? What did you see?""Clarice Starling - ""Lambs. The lambs were screaming.""Commonly touted alongside Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley as one of the all-time-best movie heroines, Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling is an icon. Whilst this is largely down to the captivating performance at the heart of the film, another crucial reason is how the director (Jonathon Demme) frames our protagonist. Throughout the film, the camera will occasionally position itself in Clarice's point of view. This means that whoever Clarice is talking to (serial killer or otherwise) will often stare directly down the lens and thus directly at the audience. This allows viewers to become a pseudo-psychologist themselves and deduce the intentions and thoughts of multiple characters in Clarice's periphery. Furthermore, this technique also forces audiences to identify with Clarice, as she navigates a case that, due to her age, gender and position, involves all eyes being on her.Jack Crawford - ""Starling, when I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you didn't it? It was just smoke, Starling. I had to get rid of him.""Clarice Starling - ""It matters, Mr Crawford. Cops look at you to see how to act. It matters.""Thankfully, to match the astounding performances at the heart of the film, The Silence of the Lambs bolsters a captivating, quick-paced and unbearably suspenseful story spread across a 2-hour runtime. By using the conversations with Hannibal almost like beginnings of a chapter, the film signposts where the story is heading, without giving any of its delicious twists away. This feat is even more impressive as Lector himself is only on screen for 24 minutes and 52 seconds, yet the pacing is so exquisite that his absence is never truly felt. Furthermore, the hunt for Buffalo Bill serves to keep both the audience and Clarice on their toes. By drip-feeding revelations surrounding Bill's psyche and own particular brand of horror, a sense of trepidation, tension and terror is expertly raised throughout the film. This then reaches a crescendo where, after a clever misdirect, Clarice finally confronts Bill in what has to be one of the most suspenseful battles ever put to screen. Does anybody breathe when the lights turn out?Clarice Starling - ""He won't come after me.""Ardelia Mapp - ""Oh really?""Clarice Starling - ""He won't. I can't explain it... He - he would consider it rude.""With a haunting score, powerful performances and exquisite pacing, The Silence of the Lambs personifies everything a psychological thriller should be. It is thematically rich, touching on overt and covert sexism, childhood trauma and the philosophy behind serial killers all while brimming with endlessly quotable dialogue, a lightning-fast pace and iconic characters. Honestly, I doubt many could argue with The Silence of the Lambs' status as both a classic for its genre as well as the medium of film as a whole. However, although not everyone may agree with it being the best film of all time, after a rewatch, I'd willingly fight anyone who claims it isn't close."

tt0372784,"I enjoyed the movie, and I thinks it is worth of the good rating in IMDb. The plot was good enough and I even liked the first half of the movie. But here and there there were things that just felt wrong, here is a short list from the top of my mind (and from the worst to the least):1. Close combat scenes. It was very hard to understand what was going on, wobbly camera, darkness and fast multi angle cuts adding to the confusion. Almost as bad as in Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Only reason I can think is that Christian Bale didn't wan't to learn to act hand to hand combat. But in most of the battles he is wearing the bat-mask (and fighting masked enemies) so they could have used a stunt double to do the dirty work. Go figure, maybe it's just a close-combat directing fad.2. Microwave-machine that can vaporise water many yards away... ... but vaporises nothing water based (blood, anyone?).3. Undestructible Bat-tank Running through 20 inch concrete wall that is designed to stop vehicles from running through it (being in between of the lanes...). No way something that flimsy could do that, no matter how high-tech it is. Can't say for sure but I think it even went wheels-first to the walls. Some wheels there. And it wasn't even made to break walls, but to jump over rivers.4. Tricycle-Bat-tank There is a reason wheels are usually located in the sides and near the corners of a vehicle, it's called stability. And if it was meant for for rough terrain bridge building, no wonder army was not interested. That thing would topple over at the first sight of a slope.5. Gun in a courthouse Bruce was able to smuggle a gun in to a courthouse in a crime-infested town? I can understand the assassin (bribing and all) but Bruce? Maybe he did some heavy bribing off-screen.6. Grapple-gun Okay, just a minor rant here, it is one of his trademark toys so no way to exclude it from movie no matter how ridiculous it is. Rest of the Bat-suit and accessory was well portrayed (maybe excluding the bat-throwing-stars), even the armor was told not to be bullet proof."
tt0139414,"Lake Placid: 4/10Another ""monster"" movie that was shown back to back with Congo the other week. On paper, this was a little more interesting, because the concept of a sea creature is more intriguing that killer gorillas. However, the creature turned out to be a mere slightly enlarged crocodile, not nearly as scary (or big) as what the movie poster/cover made it look like. I was expecting something comparable to the Loch Ness Monster, being a buff of the paranormal, so was disappointed. Oliver Platt's character was pretty cool though."
tt1130884,"With this tripe, Mr. Scorcese enters into my ""hit or miss"" category. He has made some great flicks, no question, with the latest being ""The Departed."" But, Marty seems to have gone totally derivative here (Kubrick, Hitchcock and Bergman, for example) and left his creativity somewhere else.The most remarkable thing about this movie is Max van Sydow...he's 80 years old, for cripes sake and looks 65! This is silly stuff, overwrought and overlong, with dead children being the device from the black hole of creativity that is used to horrify us and cement the plot (did John Irving work on this script?).I believe the good reviews came only because Scorcese directed, and would love to have read them if the reviewers were blinded as to who was the director.Looking back, I am trying to remember one memorable scene...but I can't. One thing's for sure: I have seen enough close-ups of Decaprio to last a lifetime."
tt0109830,"Forrest Gump, from a humble afflicted childhood, and with a low IQ, goes on to play a major part in the history of the second part of the 20th century.Forrest Gump is one of those movies that comes along every once in a while to light a fuse under the movie worlds bottom! The sort of film that has evident flaws yet packs in so much charm, wit, intelligence and sentiment to make it really difficult to dislike with any sort of conviction. Even those with an aversion to the talent of Tom Hanks would surely be kidding themselves if they honestly fail to see that Hanks, as Gump, gives anything less than an extraordinary performance.What made Forrest Gump such a well loved picture? Garnering 5 golden baldies at the Academy Awards {three of them the main ones} and earning a staggering $677,387,716 worldwide after being made for the now relatively paltry sum of $55 million? Personally I think it has a little of everything that a film watcher wants in a picture, it sure does have things many dislike {the romantic arc, the overdose of sugary sentiment}, but as Forrest lurches from each apparently none-plussed situation to another, the air of the underdog coming thru triumphant sticks in the craw, but, in a most appetising way. We are in the company of a perfectly honest, simple and innocent man, he may not know it, but Forrest Gump has become a champion of the people, both in the film and to us the movie loving public.If by some miracle you still haven't seen Forrest Gump, then I urge you to do so, it may not resonate with you as much as it did/does the majority {argue with the box office I say}, but for towering performances by Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise, and for being a clever movie with its finger on the pulse of Hollywood, Forrest Gump has few peers. 9/10"
tt1130884,"Let me start by saying Martin Score has made some great movies in the 20th century. It is now the 21st century and i think the old dog should just fund movies and let youth take control of all aspects of film making.I hate the ""1 liners"" in this movie along with the overdone musical scores. sometimes silence and raw sound are better than an artificial orchestra.I'm a Leonardo fan but his weak Boston accent made his character lame, like a boy trying to play a man. Mark Wahlberg would have been the obvious choice here. Ben Kingsley earns 3 stars to save this movie from zero. He's always solid.This movie could have been excellent with a 21st century approach. I was waiting for Arnold Schwarzenegger to have a cameo and give some stupid one liner.Sorry, this movie is weak."

tt0102926,"""Silence of the Lambs"" is profound in all aspects; there's a reason it's in a rare class of films that essentially swept the Oscars. The acting in this film is nothing short of spectacular, Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter displayed an all time classic performance as maybe the most profound serial killer ever in cinema. As he aired only a total of 16 minutes in this 2 hour masterpiece, it was Jodie Foster who was the glue with a brilliant performance as a young but courageous FBI trainee summoned to catch one serial killer by interviewing another. If you're a fan of thrillers or suspense, I can't see you not enjoying this 1991 motion picture."
tt1345836,"The Dark Knight Rises is a story of hope. Be it the false hope Bane gives Gothamites, the hope Bruce Wayne has for the city, the hope Alfred has for Bruce to leave Gotham and have a good life, the hope John Blake and Jim Gordan have of seeing the Dark Knight return, or the hope Selina Kyle has of starting anew. This movie is an epic, perfectly written, directed and just overall brilliant end to in my opinion one of the best trilogies ever made. This hope the movie offers the audience is not only enticing, but makes us want to see what we hope to see. To how we want this to end. This is indeed a highly under rated film, and in my opinion The Dark Knight just surpasses its successor for two reasons: the depth of the story, and more than that, Heath Ledger. And it was only cause of his tragic death did that movie even get nominated or win so many awards, including even Ledgers perfect performance. Im sure if he had lived, he wouldn't have gotten half the recognition he did get, and which he did deserve. Its cause of over commercialization that this movie didn't receive the recognition it deserves, like many other superhero movies, only this one was definitely one of the best like it's predecessor. And the ending did give us hope, which made for a perfect ending to Christopher Nolan's astounding Dark Knight trilogy."
tt0167261,"I really did like ""The two Towers"". However, I can't help wondering how amazing that movie could have been, if Peter Jackson hadn't had the chance to alter it after the huge fuss everyone made about ""The Fellowship"".I guess there have been a lot of changes. Gimli for example is joking throughout the whole movie. Even in the most serious moments, he doesn't seem to realize, that his life is in danger. I guess Jackson noticed, that dwarf-jokes work well on the audience - so why not expand that to 'a-joke-a-minute'? But that's not the worst thing about ""Two Towers"".I totally loved the first part of the movie. Everything was just great. Gollum was superb, the whole movie was splendid. But then, it started going wrong. Why did Aragorn have to fall off that cliff? Why did Jackson have to include Elrond and Galadriel again? In a really stupid scene, anyway. I didn't mind Aragorn's phantasizing about Arwen though. I think that was nice.But why in the world did Jackson make Faramir such a bad character? He doesn't take Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath in the book, why should he in the movie? He supports them in the book and is a purely good character. That whole Osgiliath scene was just totally annoying.The same goes for the Ents. I was afraid that they would look stupid - but they didn't. They looked great. They were just like Tolkien described them in the book. But why did they have to refuse fighting at first after a long period of thinking. And then, when they see Isengard, they decide in two seconds to attack - Treebeard just has to shout and out they all jump. 'Cause they're so fast... Yeah, sure!The Helm's Deep fighting was good, but what on earth was Haldir doing there? Just included to have another hero dying, I suppose. And the counting thing between Legolas and Gimli is included and then again not really, because it ends just after it began. No caves to discover for Gimli either.I know of course that you can't include everything in one movie, but there was some 'additional' crap in ""The Two Towers"" (meaning that it was not in the book) that could have been left out and a lot of original scenes that were left out.Don't get me wrong: ""The two Towers"" was a great movie.

tt0167261,"The Two Towers can only be explained in one word, beautiful.  This film left me breathless.  I was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the Fellowship of the Ring, and I must say that it has surpassed the film completely.  I will have a hard time watching the Fellowship and seeing the ending, knowing there is so much more waiting.Let's start with Gollum.  Gollum gave an astonishing performance.  The poor misunderstood beast, or the darkened soul creature whose cares are only based on the One Ring.  The performance given in CGI is at times very human. The facial expressions given could strangely give this character a personality as you would see in any great actor.  Gollum's voice is still haunting, even when the beast appears to be the loving guide to the dark gates of Mordor.  For these reasons and more, Gollum has become my favorite character in the film, replacing Legolas in the Fellowship.On the other side of Middle Earth we see Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli.  I have to say that the dark times of this movie are at times overbearing, and saddening.  There is a perfect mix of humor in the film given by the characters Gimli, and Legolas, while still keeping the viewer in understanding that these are very darkened times.  Aragorn's performance is outstanding.  He has proven that he can be put on an A-List of actors, and deserves appraise for his performance.Gandalf ""the White"" in this film was a twist.  We remember the friendly Gandalf The Grey in the Fellowship being a kind elderly wizard.  Shouting off fireworks for the children of the shire, and smoking ""leaf"" as explained in the novel.  There are no cute scenes with the new White Wizard.  No fireworks, or pipes.  Just a Wizard that knows the daunting task ahead, and the quest seems to have taken hold of the great wizard.Very dark are the times for Frodo, and Samwise.  Gollum seams to give Frodo hope, as the two ring bearers can associate the pains of the One Ring. Frodo gives an amazing performance this time around as well.  It seams that the Ring of power has taken hold of Frodo, and our hero is slipping.  But the surprise was aimed at Samwise.  Proving that Sam is the definition of a true best friend.  Even at times when it seems there is no hope for the troubled trio, it seams that Sam brings hope to the moment.  This is what keeps the Frodo's story this time around even more extraordinary, is the hope that is there, even when all odds point to despair.Merry and Pippin's story is very odd initially.  The Ents in the story are very wise and newly troubled creatures from the amazing mind of Tolkien. This story goes back to cut scenes during the worries of the rest of Middle Earth, and gives us a feeling of hope, in the troubled times of Aragorn and the others.  The Ents were very well done CGI wise, but it was there personality that moved the audience.  They are curiously wise, and well spoken and give the impression of an elderly college Professor.  Their story is eventually given a wonderful opportunity, and for those of us who know the story, know that greatness is upon them.This movie honestly moved me further than I thought any film could.  I could see my face and the emotion I felt as I was watching this mammoth film. Peter Jackson has truly given us all a gift of a magnificent.  This story has captivated my heart, and the film has taken my breath away.  There is no words that can express the greatness of this film. 10/10"
tt1375666,"Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" (2010) is a complex science fiction thriller about a group of people with varying specific skills that create a perfect team of dream-sharers. Dom Cobb, the main protagonist, is an extractor who is able to find out people's secrets by intruding into their dreams. His right-hand is Arthur, who researches and plans what they are trying to accomplish in a dream. Bright graduate student Ariadne is the architect for the dreams, meaning she literally constructs the physical aspects of a dreamscape. Eames is a professional at turning into anyone else in a dream, almost like shapeshifting. Lastly, Yusuf is a chemist who creates perfect concoctions of sedatives to achieve ideal conditions for the dreams to take place. This elaborate combination of characters is asked by a rich businessman, Saito, to infiltrate his dying competitor's son, Robert Fischer's, dream and place an idea in his mind so that Saito's business can become more successful. Traveling through the layers of someone's mind and making them think of an idea on their own is what they call ""inception."" Cobb is dedicated to making this happen so that Saito can arrange for Cobb's return to America to see his children. Without Saito, Cobb would not be able to return to America because of his alleged criminal background, but Saito has connections and power to clear his name. Some members of his team think achieving inception is impossible, but Cobb convinces them to be on board and they must come up with a mastermind plan with no room for error to achieve this extremely difficult yet imperative task. They begin a three-layer plan that involves elaborate depths of the dream dimension, taking advantage of Fischer's sensitive and dysfunctional relationship with his father, practiced methods of leaving a dream and entering the next, all while trying to avoid Cobb's wife Mal who lives in his subconscious and often sabotages his plans. The shocking ending leaves viewers at a cliffhanger and fans theorizing.Now that I've gone over the plot, let's talk about the other components of the film. The marketing strategies did an excellent job gathering hype for the film. The movie poster features the famous actors that everyone was excited to see, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Elliot Page, and the rest of the dream crew. It also says ""Inception"" in a large red font and notes that is directed by the same director of ""Dark Knight,"" which was an insanely successful and highly rated movie that was premiered two years prior to Inception. Dark Knight scored a 94% on rotten tomatoes and is #112 on IMBD's most popular movie list. This likely drew in the audience from Christopher Nolan's movies and set a high expectation for the quality of Inception. Another great marketing move was the contents of the teaser trailer. The trailer features a brief voiceover of Leonardo DiCaprio and amazing scenes with impressive cinematography taken out of context that show the viewers the production value and exciting action contents of the film all while confusing them so that they go see the film when it is released. I think the shock factor and science fiction aspect of the trailer is owed to the scene where a city block starts to fold over top of itself.The content of the film stayed true to the marketing because the cinematography, directing, and acting is quite well-done. Starting with the cinematography, the zero gravity scenes and cityscape building from the ground up were very realistic looking and intensified the movie watching experience. There was a lot of attention to detail. The directing of Inception is very montage based. It draws amounts and amounts of suspense. For example, the montage near the end of the film with the van, the fortress, and the hotel was painfully long but created such thick suspense. For the acting, I only have compliments and no complaints. Inception was casted beautifully and everyone fit their roles perfectly. Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job as Dom Cobb, especially in the emotional scene with his wife and two kids in one of the dreams. My personal favorite performance was Cillian Murphy's role as Robert Fischer. He played as his character really well and he captured his relatively constant sadness surrounding his father situation.Inception is a staple film in the science fiction genre and is similar to a few other sci-fi movies as well. Inception is at #135 on IMBD's most popular movie list and has a rating of 87% on rotten tomatoes, so there is no doubt about its quality. In my opinion, Inception is pretty similar to the well-loved movie ""The Matrix"" (1999) starring Keanu Reeves. They are both iconic science fiction and action films with themes of alternate realities. The second film I think is very similar is a more recent film, Tenet (2020) with Robert Pattinson. Tenet is also about bending the rules of science and is also directed by Christopher Nolan. If you enjoyed either of these movies, I recommend Inception. I also recommend it to general fans of Christopher Nolan's directing, so if you have watched and enjoyed any of his films, you would probably like Inception too.On my rating scale of one to five, with one being the worst possible score and five being perfect, I give Inception a five. It has no weaknesses in my opinion. Every aspect of this movie combines into perfection. The acting and cinematography is what takes it over the top, and I am a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and Cillian Murphy in all of the roles they play. This is a movie I have voluntarily watched multiple times and it only gets better with each watch. It is very complex and a complete experience to view. My favorite aspect of the film is the ending. Many people say they hate cliffhangers, but I enjoy them because it leaves it up to the audience to imagine. Basically, you can choose your own ending based on what you think makes the most sense with the facts you are given in the film."
tt0110912,"I think that there is a herd mentality about this film. Because Tarantino cultists liked it, people say things like ""the best film of the 90's"". People seem to think that they are not cool unless they loved Pulp Fiction. Maybe I just don't get it, but what is so great about it? It's circular, big deal. The entire film is pointless, and I really don't care about any of the characters. The violence is gratuitous. I am not squeamish. I have watched, and, I have to admit, enjoyed Romero's ""dead"" films. It is supposedly funny when the kid gets shot in head and his brain is splattered all over the inside of the car. Yep, that is hilarious. The only good thing about the film is that John Travolta is in it."
tt0133093,"The old saying goes that the people who often write the stories that people consider to be new and fresh often end up being the most predictable stories of them all. It still mystifies me how this film became such a pop culture icon while films that explored similar ideas (and did them better) like They Live, Ghost in The Shell, and The Truman Show go on to become mere cult films.As a critic, I sometimes fear that I've become another cog in the machine, repeating praises that other, more worthy critics have already lavished upon a film, so I suppose there's a certain relief to be found when I find a film that's widely praised as The Matrix to fall short of its said praise. That's not to say that I hate this film simply to stick it to the popular opinion, I genuinely don't like this movie.It was originally Doug Walker's video on The Matrix that initially inspired my anger and disdain for the film, as before then I was rather mixed on it, not entirely sure what to make of it but realizing that it wasn't the mind blowing experience that I expected. I know there's some out there who've grown disenfranchised with Walker's style for various reasons, and even I've noticed that he's begun to grasp for straws with The Nostalgia Critic, and I've grown to prefer his videos where he's himself, allowing himself to flesh out his ideas. But the video, obnoxious as it might be for some, did open my eyes to the fact that perhaps The Matrix isn't the film that people thought, alongside what people claim it to be.Predictably, it's been my disdain for The Matrix that has caused the most derision from people, which I find odd as it makes me wonder how so many people clicked with this film. A friend of mine explained it to me: much like Star Wars, no one had ever seen anything like The Matrix before. Then again, most people probably hadn't seen Ghost in The Shell, a thoughtful, radical reinvention of the cyberpunk genre, and one that The Matrix would shamelessly knock off 4 years later, or They Live, John Carpenter's pulpy yet also surprisingly thoughtful critique of Reagan era politics, or Dark City and The Truman Show, two films that had come out the previous year and both that I thought had a much more complex and thorough exploration into similar concepts that The Matrix would touch upon.The Matrix is basically a dull retread of Plato's Allegory of The Cave, touching upon the ideas of Plato's original story but never really bothering to say anything about them, it's the same critique that Ebert lobbied upon Fight Club, ironically from the same year, yet at least Fight Club had decent characters, intriguing ideas, and an dirty, grungy style, (though I much prefer Se7en) but with The Matrix...there's nothing.Perhaps that's hyperbolic, The Matrix does have several things going for it. The slick cinematography certainly oozes atmosphere, I quite enjoyed how the font would change from The Matrix to the real world, the action is well helmed, as The Wachowskis have been well regarded as action directors, and its paced quite nicely, yet the film would be dragged down by its dull characters, overtly expository dialogue, and flat storytelling.Nothing is left to the imagination in The Matrix, as much as its avid supporters would have you think otherwise. Characters dump information in the same dull, bored tone, there's no variety or humanity within the characters, and the film spends too long over-explaining things. The audience's intelligence is constantly insulted throughout the film, which is probably what angers me the most about this film. I've had more forgiving friends of mine who would explain to me how the studio had interfered with the film and forced them to change several things from it, though I don't easily buy into that excuse. If that were the case, then it shouldn't have been so hard to get around the hurdles and keep it compelling, yet alas they didn't. There are several scenes that I exempt, like the initial red pill/blue pill scene as well as the deja vu sequence (which is actually my favorite bit of the film). But asides from that, the film is a rather dull, flat experience, asides from flashes of excellence split throughout the film. There were bits throughout the film where I came up with ideas with how they could have made it better, like how in the Matrix, the people could be more dull and emotionally stunted since the robots don't know human nature as well, though when they're out of the Matrix, they can act more human and expressive, yet they didn't do that.In the end, it's another piece of science fiction fluff that thinks itself smarter than it is, and it made me think back to a quote from Ellison.""If you make people think they're thinking, they'll love you; but if you really make them think, they'll hate you.""*sigh* how right you were, Harlan...how right you were."
tt1853728,"At first I didn't want to see this movie because of some political remarks made by Jamie Foxx and Samuel Jackson, two of my previously favorite actors, but Quintin Tarentino is a great director, so I broke down and saw it. Glad I did. This was absolutely one of the best movies of the year. Although Jamie Foxx has top billing, this film would not have been anywhere as good without Christoph Waltz. He stole every scene he was in. Brilliant acting and great comedic delivery. Leo was great too. Lots of blood, something expected in most of Quintins movies, but a great story. Also expect to hear the N word about 2000 times. Cristoph Waltz should get the Oscar for his performance. Should get nominated for best picture. This is absolutely a must see."
tt0108052,"Why are people behaving rude when writing reviews? I'm not a jew or from Poland but i lived in Poland few years and it's the totally same what i saw in there and in this movie. in my opinion you people should be bit more humble!
They made an effort to make this movie and it's a nice movie !!"
tt0172495,"Visually, ""Gladiator"" is a masterpiece. I saw a documentary about how they made this film long before I saw the actual movie and it's amazing to see how they used CGI to construct an enormous FULL stadium even though most of it wasn't real! The costumes, props, chariots and trappings were also gorgeous--as good as anything you'll ever see in a film about ancient Rome. And, with some spectacular stunts and TONS of blood, it is brutal--but spectacularly brutal. You really have to see this film and it will knock your socks off.If you look at my summary, however, I say that the film is a bit disappointing as well. As a retired history teacher, I know that much of the history shown in this film is wildly inaccurate. It bears only a very superficial semblance to the facts and it's a shame, as the true story of Emperor Commodus would make for an exciting film. In addition, at times I felt as if the dialog was just awful. Too often, folks talks as if they were making speeches or delivering lines in a high school play. And, it turns out I am not alone. After the film, I read through the IMDb trivia and noticed that the actors ALSO hated the dialog and much of it was changed....though in my opinion, not enough of it was changed. There was often no emotion other than rage or boredom from Maximus, for example. His grief at the crucifixion of his family sounded LESS emotional than it should have--like he was upset that the commissary forgot to but cheese on his burger--not like a man grief-stricken with loss. Simply put, the human side to the film is stilted.So what you are left with is a WILDLY exciting film--a true spectacle. But it lacks the humanity and truth that would have made it even better. Still, it's well worth seeing."
tt0167261,"As you know Tolkien did a great job with creating the world. Also did a perfect job with writing the battles. Also It's not that easy to fitting that to the adaptation. The whole cast did pretty perfect job with The Two Towers. I know whole Trilogy made in same time. Only the film editors are changing through the trilogy. So they managed a great job making these movies.I think The Siege of Minas-Tirith sequence is also pretty good and flawless. But the horror and darkness is so effective in The Helm's Deep Battle. You may predict the Rohan People are going to win, they're the good guys after all. But even if you are watching this movie second time, you will feel that hopeless times again.The first half of the movie feels slow, I think that brings realistic style to a fantasy movie. Of course there is too important scenes in the first half of the movie, I'm saying the most important scenes are in the second half of the movies. This goes for all three movies.Tell me how can a movie achieve this much? Costume Design, Makeup, Art Direction & Set Decoration, Film Editing, VFX, SFX, Scores. The Trilogy manages to be revolutionary nearly all of that. At least it is Revolutionary in 5 of them. Some movies made me love some genres, The Lord of the Rings made me love the Cinema."
tt0468569,"Too long, too dark, and too serious. The darkness is unavoidable - but exacerbated by the length, and the fact that for a movie about a superhero, it is entirely too serious. No matter how hard we try, the idea of a superhero is still a bit crazy. Imagine Bill Gates or Warren Buffet as superheroes - it's silly. So why does the film take itself so seriously? Also, it seems that the Batman story slips to the side in parts, as though the film is intent on tackling too many issues all at once. This isn't said to be contrary - the movie can be legitimately difficult to watch. It's simply too long for the content. It's not a bad film - but it's not an all-time great either."
tt0167261,"As a fan of LOTR before it came out in paperback and of the first film, I was disappointed in the sequel. Tolkien gets lost in all the mugging for the camera, uglified folks, and computer-battle scenes. It is sort of the antithesis of Tolkien, who presented hobbits as admirable for their simplicity and courage. The wrong aspects of seventeen- year-old boys are being appealed to here."
tt0109830,"In all fairness and all clich√©s and preachy political statements aside, Forest Gump is an extremely watchable film on a basic level.If you just see it as a straightforward biographical story, then director Robert Zemeckis really gets you involved in the main character throughout his life. It features comedy, a war story, portrayals of eras, issues of acceptance and tops it off with a romance story--all supported by mostly strong performances and a fantastic soundtrack.However, when you scratch the surface of some of these things--and sometimes you don't even have to--you see the many issues that the film attempts to tackle and they are so many and so stupidly treated that it really ends up a babble of political correctness. AIDS, prostitution, racism, war, drugs and conformity are all touched upon at various stages of Forest's life as he experiences them like the innocent child that he is.The treatment of some of these issues is offensively moralistic and perpetuates and facilitates the holier-than-thou moral high-ground that Zemeckis takes in the film.Example: Forest fights in Vietnam war. Forest denounces war. Forest makes best friends with an African American guy. Forest won't take drugs. Forest helps bitter handicapped guy. Forest has a sincere mind. The only remotely rebellious character in this film is killed off with AIDS.Or maybe I'm simply too cynical to truly enjoy Forest Gump and its preachy optimism and 'fine-and-dandy' attitude. Either way, this film is obnoxiously politically correct but still quite enjoyable.6/10"
tt0109830,"This was an interesting trip through the eyes of an idiot, as he is referred to by most in the film. I loved the music during the particular events, as well. Yes, this was an excellent film and yes, Tom Hanks is brilliant. The film is ultimately a talkie, though, and I'm not into talkies. I also found the film overlong with possibly too much information crammed into it. The visual effects were very good, especially the war scenes. The film does teach us a few lessons, e.g. never to judge a person by appearance, and never going back on promises made, and probably also not to give up on your dreams."
tt0993846,"Strictly for those adult enough to accept the dialogue of strong language throughout, also littered with many sex/drug references.Not a Scorsese great, but still was a hit in which it's lead of Dicaprio (whom the director legend used in the aviator) performs at a high level in a corporal enterprise."
tt0816692,"An epic science fiction movie.Not just epic due to its running time - about 2 3/4 hours - but also due to its physical scale and the boldness of its concepts. Christopher Nolan has shaped a movie that tackles some fairly complex astrophysical issues, and carried it off with aplomb.Fantastic special effects, a clever plot and decent performances by an all-star cast.Not perfect though. The sci fi parts are great but the relationship / human drama stuff seems clumsy at times.The scene setting at the beginning seems to take forever. We all know the really good stuff - the space scenes - are coming at some stage but Nolan draws out the more mundane earth stuff.Plus, there are scenes and plot detours which feel unnecessary, and periods where the movie seems to drift. The Matt Damon sub-plot just felt like padding.Some of the seemingly unnecessary, overly contrived or implausible things do ultimately have a purpose. The conclusion ties up many loose ends and/or justifies some of the flat moments, but not all."
tt0372784,"An exciting foray into Nolan's Batman Universe. Bruce Wayne's origin story is refreshing, but more intriguing is the setting of the run-down, dreary, and insidious Gotham - a city that clearly is in need of hope. This first part of the trilogy provided characters to root for, and left me looking forward to how Gotham will change, or not, in the Dark Knight. The flow of the movie made it a fun and easy watch, stoking at suspense and providing a decent payoff. However, in the light of the trilogy, Batman Begins has low replay value, and lacks a certain degree of thoughtfulness that is expected from Nolan. Liam Neeson's Ra's Al Ghoul is a rather flat character at the end of the day, and the cartoonish main conflict fails to match the gloomy tones of the movie. Scarecrow had great potential but I feel that the movie failed to capitalize, as weak as he ended up rather inconsequential. In all, can be seen as just another good action movie, as it lacks the creativeness and sense of masterpiece we see in TDK. Strong 6 to a light 7."
tt0480025,"This film is well photographed, brilliantly cast and impressively acted. There's a lot of attention to detail with the clothes, cars, music, etc, evoking the early 1980s beautifully. However the whole skinhead cult had more-or-less died by 1983 (even in the North where this is set) and the only real boots-and-braces skins around then were either in extreme factions of the NF or were gay skins on the gay scene.Also the film's central theme is wooly to say in the least. This probably has a lot to do with the fact that the writer (Shane Meadows) has combined parts of his own story with the cast's own real life stories and other elements but this has made plot nonsensical.As it is Meadows is poking a finger at racists and thugs by saying that they are a bunch of misfits. This is perhaps best displayed by the shot of Combo's gang walking through town shown in slow motion with no two of them looking the same. Young Sean feels he is an outsider and so joins the gang to become someone (like Jimmy in Quadrophenia) but is forced to confront the gang's racism. However scenes of Combo and his 'gang' terrorising local Asians and spouting off about patriotism, as well as attending an NF meeting, are clich√©d to say in the least and here the film looses its way.I get the impression that Meadows wanted to set the film earlier in 1980/81 when the whole skin/NF thing would make sense but has been forced to set it in 1983 to put it after the Falklands conflict. This is so Sean's dad can be a casualty of the war which gives Sean a sense of loss, a reason to be an outsider and a reason to join the gang. This brings up one of the film's (proposed) themes which is about patriotism. However this theme is confused because, far from criticising the troops in the Falklands, National Front skinheads embraced it because they were standing up for England. However this theme is seemingly dropped about two thirds of the way through the film and so when it ends with the shots of the Falklands war it becomes meaningless. Why not drop the patriotism theme and set the film in 1980 when the skinhead thing would make sense (a lot of kids got into the Two Tone/Ska thing at that time and as a result the NF did try to recruit a lot of them), then everything else might fall into place.Parts of the film do work and are charming, almost funny (eg the scene where Sean wants his mum to buy him a pair of DM boots) but there are some bizarre elements which must be addressed:The idea that Smell, who is supposed to be about 17/18, would be happy to have Sean as her boyfriend when he's only 12 (and is about half her size) is frankly ridiculous. If it were done purely for comic relief it might just work but the fact that the characters have an intense discussion about the relationship means it is supposed to be deadly serious.Combo is supposed to 32. Even back in the early 80s if a 32 year old guy hung around with teenagers people would think he was either retarded or a pervert. But he and his even older mate (who looks like a gay leather clone or a roadie for ZZ Top) mix with the kids as though it were normal. This is not normal, it is bizarre.The scene where Combo confronts Lol about their 'relationship' and presents her with a gift he made for her in prison is equally bizarre. Violent, racist thugs just don't do this sort of thing.But the oddest part is the ending where Combo beats up the black guy Milky. It has been suggested elsewhere that this is because Combo is himself mixed race (like Milky) but he is insanely jealous of Milky's life and so goes for him. This would be barely credible if it were actually addressed in the film but the writer has omitted to make any of this clear, thus making the whole scene confusing and rather ugly.It would have been so much better to see a film about skinheads and their lives without making it a film about racism and violence but I guess that's never going to happen. But if you're going to try and do something different then DO something different. Don't do what the creators of This Is England have done and combine shock tactics with embarrassingly clich√© after clich√©. It just doesn't work."
tt0110912,"Pulp Fiction is one of the worst blights on American Cinema anyone could conceive of. Tarantino's enthusiasm for the awful films he loves to rehash is amusing, and his dialogue snappy and funny, but he is not a great filmmaker and his films are not great films. Him and his films get by on retro-mania, smugness, and arrogance, and will date as horribly as his source material has. Tarantino is symptomatic of everything that is wrong with indie filmmaking in the nineties, and nineties youth culture in general. Cinema, and the world, could have done without him."
tt0167260,"You kind of have to take the movie on its own terms. It is what it is...long, confusing, battles that don't matter. On the other hand there are great characters, good acting, amazing effects, great direction (esp the spider sequences). The film just sort of is...it won't change the world, won't make sense if you have not seen the others, but it is an enjoyable way to kill an evening"
tt0167261,"The only redeeming quality of this film was the epic battle sequences.  A pornography of violence is the only thing that saved this film from being terribly boring.The characters were very flat.  Interaction between them was predictable (predictable, even without having read the books).  For example, the undeveloped subplot between Aragorn and that princess was cliche.  From the moment a hint of her liking him came out, I could see what was going to happen.The only interesting character was Golum.  He symbolized the external battle for good and evil through an internal struggle.The dialogue in this movie offered nothing.  It was mostly about one group's plans, followed by the enemies plans.Well.  I don't want to think much more about this movie.  I think it was terrible.  The fighting scenes and animation were cool.  Perhaps the ""acting"" parts should be cut and the remaining scenes should be edited as cut scenes into a video game or something, because this definately doesn't stand as a film on its own."
tt0110912,"OK, It has a College studio play type gimmick. Otherwise, the highlight is Samuel L Jackson quoting fake Bible verses with the conviction on an Elijah.Nothing else to see here. When it ended I thought... ""what a Terrible waste of my time!"" and felt actually angry about it!"

Even through the Good, and the Sad, and the Bad, he kept going, and that showed the importance to the time we have on earth. To be grateful and so aware of what we've been given on this planet.I don't want to say too much, but I want to conclude by saying, Tom Hanks playing Forrest Gump and all the other cast acted and told a story in this film, a story that carries and teaches the importance of, well almost anything. ""Life is like a Box of Chocolate, you never know what you're going to get.""Nava Medikonda on Forrest Gump."
tt0172495,"Gladiator is the type of spectacle-based film that previously helped Hollywood establish its reputation but is now a rarity. Gladiator is a film that aims to enthral as well as delight with its epic tale, breathtaking setting, and larger-than-life characters. It captivates viewers and submerges them in a realm that is different from their own. Every time the hero overcomes the odds and prevails in a skirmish or swings the balance of battle in his favour, a raucous response is anticipated. This is a large-scale piece of filmmaking.Director Ridley Scott established his reputation in the industry by directing the science fiction classics Alien and Blade Runner. Apart from such movies, though, his filmography is filled with average and unenthusiastic works, as his most recent project, G. I. Jane. (Some claim that the overrated Thelma and Louise from 1991 marked Scott's return to form, but I disagree.) The British-born filmmaker's second historical epic, Gladiator, is much more successful than his first, the tedious 1492: Conquest of Paradise, which chronicled Christopher Columbus' voyage to the New World."
tt1375666,"""The mind is like an iceberg, it floats with one-seventh of its bulk above water."" -Sigmund FreudChristopher Nolan's ""Inception"" plays very much like its subject matter described so aptly above by Freud. On your first viewing, you will quite possibly only grasp just a fraction of its complexity, but the brilliance of what this reviewer proclaims as Nolan's masterpiece lies in how engaging it is- even though you cannot quite fully comprehend what Nolan is trying to say. Indeed, it may take multiple viewings for one to absorb completely his audacious new creation that dares to tackle as dense and intricate a subject as that of dreams.It isn't easy to understand the nature of dreams, particularly because they seem to defy logic. The same can probably be said of some of the elements in ""Inception"", but in order for one to understand what dreams really are, one has to first accept that they are not part of the conscious mind, and therefore cannot be understood by rationality. Freud proposed that the rational mind is just that one-seventh of the iceberg that we see, and the rest of the mind is made up of the preconscious and the unconscious. Freud also believed that dreams were the road to the unconscious and existed in the preconscious, a state between the conscious and the unconscious mind.It is in this context that Nolan invites his audience to approach ""Inception"". Here, Nolan imagines a world of corporate espionage where a thief enters a person's mind during his dreams to steal ideas. This process he terms ""extraction"", done by a team of people who design the architecture of the dreams, plant several people including the subject into the dream, forge identities within the dream and then proceed to steal the idea from the subject. Leonardo DiCaprio is the master thief of them all, Dom Cobb, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt his long-time right-hand man Arthur.But this latest mission is different- a tycoon Saito (Ken Watanabe) wants him to plant an idea (so termed inception) within a rival's (Cillian Murphy) mind in order that he will break up his ailing father's business empire after he takes over. Cobb agrees to this dangerous mission- a fugitive wanted for the murder of his wife, Saito promises that if Cobb succeeds, he will wipe Cobb's slate clean so he is allowed to return to the United States to see his children. So Cobb begins assembling his team- the architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), the forger Earnes (Tom Hardy) and the chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao)- think of it like a heist, only much more complicated.As Cobb explains the rules of the game to his team while preparing for their mission, Nolan is too establishing the rules of his game to his audience- what it means to die in a dream, why one can feel pain even when you're in a dream, the significance of the people you see in your dream, the difference between dream time and real time. Not to spoil the experience to you- but suffice to say that there are many many such rules that Nolan plays by in his movie. Those who have had some experience in the study of dreams will likely grasp this more quickly, but those who have not may take more time to accept the logic and regulations behind Nolan's world- hence the multiple viewings.Regardless, there is no doubt that it is engrossingly intriguing. All this takes place in the first half of the movie, which sets the stage for the inception itself in the latter half, an ingenious conceit set within a world of layered dreams that defies any description. Nolan uses the interconnectedness of these elaborate dream layers to intercut several breathtaking action spectacles - the storming of a vault within the Arctic within a zero-gravity fight along a hotel corridor within a high-speed vehicular freeway chase. Each of these would be thrilling in their own right, but with Nolan's vision, Wally Pfister's expansive photography and Lee Smith's fine editing, the simultaneous unfolding of these set-pieces is utterly riveting.Besides grand action, Nolan also delivers heart-wringing moments courtesy of Cobb's troubled past with his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who threatens to wreak havoc on his missions by surfacing from his unconscious in the most inopportune manner. We're kept in the dark most of the time, believing that Mal is an insidious presence Cobb is unable to eradicate, but Nolan's reveal towards the end of the film that puts into perspective Cobb's unresolved guilt delivers an emotional finish that will leave you floored.As with his previous movies, Nolan displays a knack for choosing actors who can best embody the characters in his films. While DiCaprio's role here may be reminiscent of that in his earlier Shutter Island, there's no question that he anchors the movie with a perfectly calibrated performance that is equal parts intense and heartfelt. The rest of the supporting characters fill out their roles just as vividly- Joseph Gordon-Levitt radiates confidence and suavity, Ellen Page displays suitable wit and grit, and in particular Marion Cotillard exudes both sultriness and danger in an edgy yet eventually heartbreaking performance.But ""Inception"" is Nolan's vision through and through- and in fact, a visionary director and a master filmmaker at that. Many years Nolan spent refining his screenplay, and it shows in the great detail and complexity that makes ""Inception"" both an intellectual and visceral enjoyment- just take the names of the various characters, each of which have a special significance. With ""Inception"", Nolan invites you to open your mind to possibilities- possibilities of alternate realities, of complexities beyond the conscious mind to grasp and most importantly, of the power of imagination. It is that rare gem of a film that is so multi-layered, so profound and so fascinating that you'll want to experience it again immediately after you've seen it- just so you can fully appreciate its genius."
tt0137523,"Fight Club has a very interesting story and one that is delivered quite well it's two leads Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Som efolks have commented that Helena Bonham Carter was an odd casting choice for main female role but I prefer to think of her selection as yes, unexpected, but quite good at the same time. Like I said the initial story is really interesting but it gradually loses focus and clarity as the film progresses. Despite this there is still enough going on here to keep things interesting and of consequence, amd does give the viewer some things to think about and ponder. If you still haven't seen Fight Club check it out and see what you think."
tt0848228,"Boy, am I in trouble. Because I thought it was just plain silly.Maybe it's because I haven't seen Thor. Because I found Tom Hiddleston so ludicrously miscast as Loki that I couldn't maintain suspension of disbelief.First, this deity who arrives in an awesome burst of netherworld energy, and carries a scepter capable of slaying whole armies, has to escape sitting awkwardly in the back of a pickup truck for God's sake. And then when he stands up in his silly horned costume and tells a crowd of people to kneel to him, his complete lack of gravitas in the role just set me laughing.I couldn't watch it after that."
tt0111161,"The classic can be recalled repeatedly. Andy is full of yearning for life and freedom. To get out of prison is a new life for him; and red, who has been used to prison life, has become numb. To get out of prison is death for him."
tt0110912,"Pulp Fiction is one of those movies you feel uncomfortable to talk about in negative terms since mainstream loves it. The real killer of this movie are the dialogs supposedly so cool but instead being silly and irritating, from the very first scene when endless minutes are waisted talking about a frivolous argument. The violence in this film, rather strong, is very often disturbing but never fun or entertaining. Tarantino takes himself a little too seriously making the movie lose most of its ironical aspect. Unless you are a fan that goes wild for the overweight Travolta, you will find his so-called cult scenes dull and of no interest. All the characters in this movie are exaggerated, and that wouldn't be a bad thing, but they also are not fun. There are some good action scenes, very few, which anyhow will not save from failure a movie that lasts 2hrs 40min!"
tt0109830,"On the plus side, I think I saw this movie for free, or at the most paid $1 for admittance when I was in college and it was shown in the campus theater. On the negative side is everything else, most notably the movie's lack of empathy for any of its character.  Every character, not just Gump, is walking through this movie with no goal, no destination, and no clue, as to what the other characters are doing.  Someone off-screen must've just shouted ""move"" over and over again, and then filmed the result.  Gump goes here.  Gump goes there.  Sally Field says this.  Sally Field dies.  And so on.  The reasons behind the historical footage inserts is not to prove it can be done but to distract one from realizing how badly the rest of the film had come together up until the inserts.Anyone who cheers for this movie must also resemble a box of chocolates - flat, consisting of cardboard, and soon empty of their contents."
tt1375666,"Of course, I had heard lots about this movie and actually love track #12 from the OST (by Zimmer), but I'd never made an effort to go watch it. Something in my mind told me it wouldn't be worth it. Besides, I'm not much impressed by DiCaprio's acting skills.Still, after a long while I wanted to see what the fuss is about. I am checking out numerous films people recommend as 'best of 2010' to me.Inception was waaaaay too shallow for me. It's a superficial action film that admittedly looks visually nice, but there's no real drama. It actually bored me. Left me cold.If you want to see a 2010 film including DiCaprio, go see Shutter Island. Much, much better, but not great, which is too bad.Anyway, I don't want to spend too many words on this Inception creation. Yawn."
tt1130884,"I saw this and I knew what to expect going in to the film as I had already read about half of the book but never got the chance to finish it. But I was surprised at how faithful the film was to the original material.The directing was also masterfully done and pretty cool I saw some cool camera tricks I hadn't seen since Martin Scorsese directed Bringing Out The Dead, Martin Scorsese did one great job and everyone was top notch especially Ben Kingsley and DiCaprio and I never though I would jump out of fright especially in a Scorsese film but I did. All in all a solid thriller with a good story and some great performances and for me it's the best film I've seen in 2010 so far."
tt0110912,"in the wake of his awesome debut, Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino could have served up just about anything and it would have been hailed as a masterpiece by all those keen to jump on the bandwagon. he, sadly, did just serve up anything.on your first viewing, Pulp Fiction does take your breath and look stunning. if you want to join the masses and celebrate this film blindly, you may then want to avoid the rest of this review and never watch the film more than once.if you be generous enough to let the flimsy, contrived plot threads go by you, the real problem here is what the film was oddly celebrated for - the bad writing and the lousy dialog that shall forever haunt this film. sure, there are one or two smart one-liners, but the problem is that each and every character in this film talks, acts and behaves the same. the lengthy speech given by Christopher Walken, for instance, is the same in tone and content as anything that Samuel L Jackson would say, and likewise Sam just talks like Uma Thurman, who talk like Bruce Willis, who talks like John Travolta, etc, etc ad nauseum.this, and the subsequent, poorer films he made, revealed Tarantino to be a confidence trickster, a, if you will, one trick pony. what a shame, he looked like he had so much talent and potential.be brave, do not just follow the crowd and the masses - see this badly written home movie for the low grade, half-dimensional nonsense that it is!!"
tt0848228,"LA Review of 'The Avengers' (No spoilers)I was lucky enough to attend the Marvel screening of 'The Avengers' on Saturday morning in Century City, CA. This was an unusual screening as movies of this caliber are not screened some three weeks before it's release date. Just minutes before the movie started, we were all surprised when writer/director Joss Whedon walked in with Kevin Feige to introduced their little ""Justice League"" movie. Not only did we all laugh, but some booed. lol. If that wasn't enough of a surprise, the soft spoken Whedon introduced on stage Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Clark Gregg (Agent Coulson) and Cobie Smulders (Agent Maria Hill). Wow is she stunning in person! The audience gave them all a standing ovation with deafening cheers! (This explained why the secret service like security were searching, wanding everyone. No cameras, cell phones, nothing was allowed in.) What a nice surprise for an early Saturday morning screening.I've never read comic books. This is a comic book movie. It was made for hardcore fans of comics, and I appreciate the care Joss Whedon gives to this movie. It was very entertaining to see Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury all interact with one another.Capt. Steve Rogers was fighting in WWII just yesterday. Having been recently awoken from his frozen sleep, he struggles to fit in our modern world with all this technology around us. The God of Thunder, Thor, is not from this world (realm) and doesn't understand modern technology on Earth as well. Dr. Bruce Banner has been on the run from the government, practicing medicine in third world countries. He hasn't been the Hulk in two years (What's his secret? ;). Tony Stark is still the same, playing with this high tech toys and inventing new technology. So how do you get them all to interact and play well together? Well, Director Joss Whedon is the secret to making it all work.The highlight of the film for me is how Joss Whedon has all these characters interact. Deep character development was not needed for this film. (That is what the respective movies are for: Thor, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger) He does a great job of not forcing dialogue, and the interaction of the characters is much more organic than I would have ever anticipated. That is where Whedon deserves the most credit. He took what appears to be a very silly premise, with silly looking characters and made it completely work. Seeing as the Avengers comics date back to the 1960s, you can tell he not only did his homework, but he really cares deeply for the material, and his passion definitely shows on- screen.The movie is vastly entertaining. The Action scenes are amazing and satisfying. Nobody is short changed when it comes to the fighting or action sequences. I felt as if there was not a single bad performance. A couple of dialogue lines seemed off, but once you remember who the character is, and why they talk the way they do (think of where they come from), it all makes sense. Each respective character is true and honest to itself. Each of the characters brought their personality (from their respective movie) to the table. It is by far the best Marvel movie to date.So who was my personal favorite character from the movie? Dr. Bruce Banner (played by Mark Ruffalo) of course! He is by far the BEST Bruce Banner/Hulk since Bill Bixby. His intelligence (genius) is unparalleled (greater than Tony Stark's) and his compassion for human lives is what drives the good side of his character. As a kid growing up, he was my favorite Marvel super hero. I enjoyed watching Bill Bixby play medical doctor/physicist Dr. David Banner on television. I'd watch, terrified with my hands up to my face, as he transformed into the raging green hulk. Yet i was so fascinated with him being a scientist, helping those in need. When Mark Ruffalo was first announced to play Bruce Banner, i didn't know what to think of it. I knew that he's a good actor. All he needs is the right director to get the needed on-screen character out of him. I really hope they make an Incredible Hulk movie sequel starring Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner. Or at least, i vote for him to reprise his role in any sequel. He was a natural fit for this role.Overall, the best thing about these characters is that they are not silly twenty-something terrible actors who were chosen for on-screen eye candy. They all do a fine job of bringing these characters to life and their chemistry together works great. Assembled, they are unstoppable. When i heard an Avengers movie was rumored to be in the works, i was ecstatic. The day has finally come. Go see it. Thrice. 10/10 Stars."
tt0109830,"This awesome movie is about an innocent man who represents how the world should be: he's loyal, humble, honest, he would never cheat or lie. He does everything with good heart and reaches success at the most important tasks of life.Only in America he could live such an interesting life: meet Elvis Presley, President Kennedy, John Lennon... He goes to Vietnam's war and he does everything following his heart. He becomes an American hero.Gary Sinise is a great American actor in his best performance too. He served in Vietnam with Forrest and was also a hero, protecting his men and fighting for his country.All in all this is a must-see movie for everyone, specially for non- Americans, so we can enjoy American culture and icons, as well as learn some American history, which is very useful."
tt0361748,"Too many morons will believe this is a factual film and those idiots will pass it on as such. It is an insult to the veterans of WWII, and an insult to the intelligence of film goers. The trailer for the film is a piece of misleading garbage that has little to do with the film, and the group portrayed in the trailer should have been called ""The Inglourious Idiots"". Added to all the above is the fact that too many Hollywood drug addicts think that having most of the film in a foreign language makes it a better film. That just proves that much of the Hollywood crowd is a bunch of snobbish, self-important, elitist, and truly uncreative a**es that do not know how to make a good film. I have never been more disappointed in a film.The high point of the movie is Brad Pitt (Angelina Jolie's live-in). His pitiful imitation of the Billy Bob Thornton (One of Angelina's many former squeezes)character in ""Slingblade"" was hilarious. The attempt to copy Billy Bob is soooooo bad that Pitt should be at the top of the list for that ""Rotten Tomato"" award..Sheesh, when will film makers try to actually make a good film again. Of the last 100 I've watched, there have been two I'd like to see again. This one is 101 on the list..."
tt7286456,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen."
tt0167261,"The Two Towers is a great movie. Is it as good as the other two films in the trilogy? I personally don't think so. I found myself less invested in some of the story elements, particularly when they involved the human characters (which occupied much of the runtime). Though not as strong as Fellowship or RoTK, this movie is full of spectacular moments.The Battle of Helm's Deep might be the best battle in cinematic history. From the driving force to the action to the gravitas, everything about that sequence is jaw-dropping. Though incredibly dark and serious, the humor is spot-on and adds a needed layer of character development.On top of the action, what this movie does well is develop relationships between characters. Frodo and Sam, Legolas and Gimli, Frodo and Sm√©agol, Aragorn and √âowyn, and beyond. The relationships in this film are superb and help push the story forward.When I want to watch incredible action and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a great movie in an amazing trilogy.Best Character: Gimli
Best Moment: The Battle of Helm's Deep (the entire thing)
Best Quote: ""Toss me."" - Gimli."
tt0120737,"Beautiful environments with lovely costumes combined with superb characters and and an intense story...the result: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.Don't let the 3 hour + running time scare you of, like so many long movies it's very well worth seeing. Never has a fantasy world looked so realistic as in Lord of the Rings. All the sets are very detailed and have a realistic feeling as well as the characters and the different races of Middle Earth.The greatest strength of this movie is not the story itself. The story itself is actually pretty simple, basically it's just about the Ring and the quest to destroy it. No, the greatest strength are the characters, the look of Middle Earth and the action sequences. Rarely has an adventure movie looked so good and has been so tense and enjoyable to watch.But let's not over praise it, the movie has it flaws and weak spots. There are some unnecessary and boring scene's (especially in the Extended Edition) but for an 3 hour + movie that's maybe just unavoidable. And no matter how awesome everything looks, the special effects aren't always top-class, I'm a firm believer that the movie would have been better if ILM provided the special effects. But let's not judge the movie for what it could have been but let's judge it for what it is. Also, sometimes the Hobbits (Sam, Pippin and Merry) are border line irritating. Another thing that disturbed me was the editing, in my opinion it was extremely bad done in some of the scene's (For instance in the wizards battle between Gandalf and Saruman) but having some editing experience myself I might pay extra attention to this things...But in this case all those flaws and weak spots are forgiven, for The Fellowship of the Ring truly is a wonderful movie that you simply must have seen at least once in your life.Already a classic!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
tt0816692,"Interstellar is a visually stunning film containing the most realistic depictions of astronomical objects such as wormholes and black holes ever shown in a film, through in- depth input from Professor Kip Thorne. Most of the acting performances are very strong, and the set design of the spaceships and alien planets are great. For those reasons alone it's worth a look, but there are some problems. Before I get into spoilers, one of the main issues is pace. The film is just too long, and in particular it takes an age to get off Earth and into space. We came here for Sci-fi, the film's called Interstellar, c'mon, how about some rockets 'n stuff? It also feels too long because the film is a checklist of every major astronomical concept ever filmed - black holes, neutron stars, wormholes, time dilation and more besides. Some simplification would have made for a better story.From here on there are spoilers.The entire plot is based on an obvious causality paradox. Matthew McConaughey's character is an astronaut turned farmer who is given the coordinates of a secret NASA base by a future version of himself, enabling him to travel to the base and be accepted into the NASA team. Only the fact that he found the base enabled him to travel into space and ultimately send this message back to his earlier self.That's not the only problem with the plot by a long way, though. While engaged in a race to save humanity, the characters waste 23 years traveling to a planet orbiting a black hole, where the theory of relativity states time is passing much more slowly. The purpose of the trip is to establish whether the planet is a suitable replacement Earth for humanity. At no point do they attempt to assess the planet from orbit (where all of it could be seen, without losing 23 years of Earth-time) but must instead visit the surface (presumably to see what a couple of square miles looks like). This ends in the death of one astronaut and the finding that the planet is no good. It's as if none of the characters have noticed that they are in a spaceship literally covered in windows. Also, the beacon saying ""everything's great here"" that they went to investigate turned out to be just a series of echoes of the initial signal it sent before being destroyed. So they were unable to predict that possibility despite clearly having a full understanding of relativistic physics, and their beacons aren't programmed to include a time stamp or any form of ID number. People this stupid deserve everything they get...At the next planet they discover that the earlier human explorer sent there (don't worry, the script includes a ridiculous explanation of why a dozen astronauts were sent to their near- certain deaths rather than using unmanned probes) turns out to be falsely sending out ""come visit, it's good here"" signals because he wants to be rescued. So the mission was designed in complete ignorance of the human instinct for self-preservation and how that could ruin everything. People this stupid deserve everything they get...In a movie that markets itself on how good and realistic its science is, we are put through some cringe making dialogue about how love is quantifiable, conquers all and will save us in the end. Anakin and Padme made me want to vomit less than that scene.Towards the end, the lead character falls into a black hole in an act of self-sacrifice. Then there are a few obvious winks to the audience designed to hint that nobody really knows what laws of physics apply inside a black hole, and then it turns out that inside black holes the last ten minutes of 2001 A Space Odyssey are being endlessly ripped off for all eternity, except with more deus ex machina. The small problem with this is that the lead character would be dead long before he got inside the Event Horizon, so...And after that, the black hole spits him out in some new, unexplained, convenient way to a region of space that just happens to be a short hop away from a space station where he can be rescued in time to meet his now-elderly daughter who saved humanity by building space stations that in no way rely on his heroic actions. And when he gets there to meet the daughter he left aged 10, who now has children and grandchildren of her own while he has not aged a year, none of them are interested, and she sends him away. The last ten minutes of the film are both redundant and stupid.All in all, Interstellar is a beautiful, well acted, engaging, interesting film let down by a plot so weak you'll feel like you're watching a moron's idea of an intelligent movie."
tt0120737,"I didn't hate this film, but I expected more.At worse I found it overblown, hard to follow and felt like I never had a moment to catch my breath.  After watching it I was left with a vague feeling similar to what you get from eating too much junk food, full but unsatisfied.   Too many sweeping vistas, overkill on the Frank Frazetta-esque beasts and baddies, and very little characterization.  Were it not for the very credible performances by the cast of top notch actors, there would have been none at all.One feels that the director Peter Jackson felt that he needed to cover so much ground (literally and figuratively) that he needed to jettison the quieter moments that make up so much of the great story.One of the best aspects of the Tolkien books was the reader feeling a sense of sweep and getting caught up in the quest, along with smaller moments of detail and quiet characterization.  The latter was sorely missing from this film.  All rush, rush, rush, with out any moments humor.  These two elements were what made ""STAR WARS"" and ""THE WIZARD OF OZ"", so great.  These two quest films, albeit in completely different milieus, were so much fun to watch, and ultimately so resonant for so many viewers because of moments of humor that allowed the audience a chance to reflect and also gave insight into the characters.  This film , with the exception of a couple of cutesy moments with Sam, Pippen and Merry and one line from Gimli, was largely humorless.I have a great deal of respect for Peter Jackson and his work. ""MEET THE FEEBLES"" and ""DEAD ALIVE"" were a couple of the funniest, most inventive bits of work to come out in a very long time and turned their genres (Muppet films and Horror) on their ear with a great eye to the absurd.  Likewise, he did a wonderful job with ""THE FRIGHTENERS"" and ""HEAVENLY CREATURES"".  I was hoping for the same here and was unfortunately disappointed.  I hope, now that he feels that he has set the stage with ""Fellowship"" that he will offer more depth and humor in the next two outings.One other thing, the film's design seemed to be just more of the same old Sword and Sorcery stuff.  ""CONAN"" mixed with ""NEVERENDING STORY.""  Blech!!!  There was even a small film that I saw recently from Spain called ""EL CORAZON DEL GUERRERO (THE HEART OF THE WARRIOR) that had far more interesting design for this genre.  I have a feeling this ain't going to be the cash cow that New Line wanted.Michael Escher"
tt7286456,"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope."

Currently my family and my friends also buy the original blue ray of this movie very hard to find a seller because all want this one to their collection part.fabulous acting, superb story and played with characters am speechless.

tt0167260,"Mr. Jackson let us all down on this one.I sat through all three of these films before it hit me. I wasn't really enjoying them.Every dramatic moment was being thrown away because it was filmed as a close-up.Over and over again, the epic context was stripped away and all we got was big, blue eyes.People say they liked these films, but I don't think they know what they are missing.I sat there disappointed as each great moment in these stories passed by without soaring to any great emotional heights. It was flat as cardboard."
tt0110912,"The world of movies did not begin and end with 'Pulp Fiction' and Quentin Tarentino is not a genius.  That aside, and taking this movie as what it is, a penny dreadful on the screen, it does become perversely enjoyable.There's the cafe where 50s idols serve dinner (Buddy Holly, Marilyn Monroe, Mamie Van Doren, Jayne Mansfield) and where Mia (Uma Thurman) and Vincent (John Travolta, undergoing a renaissance after years out in the cold) dance the twist to Chuck Berry's 'It was a teenage wedding ...'.  There's Vincent's hip black partner Jules (a sleek and cool Samuel L Jackson), and the town's big guy - and Mia's husband - Marcellus (Ving Rhames).  And then there's Butch, who gets the film in an interesting twist part way through, and he's Bruce Willis, who was everywhere the time this movie got made.And there's the inept hold-up duo - Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer - as 'Ringo' and 'Honey Bunny', the really chilled Mr Wolf (Harvey Keitel), and a cameo from Tarentino himself as Jimmie.  Does all this mean the movie is any good? Well, there's a body in a car without a head, and an o/d to Urge Overkill's 'Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon', and Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.  It's a comic party with f words.  Salivating kids may boggle at this and call it the most influential film ever - it isn't, but it is one of the most referential.  'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Jackie Brown' didn't come close, and 'Pulp Fiction' is, for what it's worth. QT's best to date."
tt0109842,"""Fresh"" is a co-production between the United States of America and France from 1994, but I am not sure at all where the French impact comes from as this is a film as American as it gets really given the subject and people who worked on it in front of and behind the camera. Let's look at the basics: The writer and director here is Boaz Yakin, who was not even 30 when he made this film. It was his first directing credit and third writing credit. Judging from the film's success and his age back then, you surely could have thought that he would have a bigger career afterwards and I mean it is not awful what he did in the almost 30 years since then, but he peaked early apparently and did not really manage to follow up. Yakin is by the way from New York, but my guess is he has Turkish roots too. Anyway, it is not too important. I already described the age of this film and this one will have its 30th anniversary in 2024 indeed, so maybe it happened already if you get here a little later to read this review of mine. Of course, this was also not the occasion on which I watched this film, but it was part of a retrospective on Black America in the movies and well it does fit in nicely from this perspective and I am not surprised they included it. I am more surprised that I never really heard of it before, even if there are at least two actors in here that I like quite a bit. The first would be Oscar nominee Samuel L. Jackson of course, who plays the protagonist's father. I could also say who plays the title character's father as the name Fresh is indeed the name of the boy. Or nickname. He says early on that it is something that only his friends call him when another character calls him by that name. One who is not his friend at all. And the second actor I am referring to is Giancarlo Esposito that most people today know from ""Breaking Bad"" and I must also say that it took me quite a bit to understand who he is in this film, even if it was a crucial character. One of the most central characters even if we look at what happens at the end. It is a bit entertaining though how you will always immediately identify Jackson, but Esposito not at all. I mean I saw him in a Spike Lee film the same day and did not recognize him at all there. He had quite the transformation as he got older.Anyway, as I said I did not know much before seeing this film, only the two actors and good ratings that got me curious, but I did not expect a film that was really so shocking and sobering from any perspective. And not light at all. I mean if we ignore for a second that the main character was working as a drug courier in his quarter when the film begins, it starts mostly harmless. He has his best friend, he is a smart kid, he even has a girl he likes and she likes him too, but yeah things really go south from there. The girl is shot on a basketball court when a man whose ego took a blow because a kid had better than him pulls a gun and shoots said kid and accidentally also shoots Fresh's crush. And as for his bets friend, who has some Asian blood in him, well they are really close as you can see when Fresh tries to somehow help the boy get away before he is shot in cold blood by some mysterious figures. Don't mistake the scene before that with the officer in the subway train for something that shows that Fresh did not care about his buddy. On the contrary, what he said there made sure that the officer would not take his friend to the station, even if the Asian kid does not understand that, but oh well.. now we know that if he had taken him to the station, he would have saved his life. Unknowingly, of course. The killing still could have happened a few days later then. And the Asian kid likes Fresh too as we see when the girl is shot and Fresh stays there and the Asian boy tries to convince him to run before he heads off without him. It was probably these two key incidents that broke something in Fresh, something that could not be fixed and repaired anymore and reflected an amount of loss that no boy should have to experience. The result was also the scene in which Fresh kills his dog. I am unsure what to make of this scene. Maybe there was no deeper meaning and he just had to let the violence out. Maybe it was because he did not want the dog to take part in these bloody dogfights anymore and die there at some point or maybe it was just because he knew he would be leaving soon and nobody would take care of the dog or maybe it was because he knew the dog could make him vulnerable, make him unsure if his decision is the right one. Or his decisions I should probably say with all that happens in the last hour.This film is also a great watch for those who like the game of chess and for me personally, this definitely helped too. The connection there is crucial if you look at the talks between his father and the boy on numerous occasions and how all he tries to do there is make the right moves and this is just as true when he makes sure that the lives of all these criminals around him have to end. Or at least their freedom comes to an end and they are arrested. This includes planting drugs and firearms under the bed of the guy he wants to get rid of eventually. The king if we are going back to the chess approach. And that is Esposito's character in this scenario. And the boy does succeed. We understand his mother has a double-digit number of children and mouths to feed and she cannot deal anymore with Fresh and his troubles and there is talk about giving him to some institution, but even there Fresh comes up with his own plans and these involve most likely a witness protection program. This way, he even saves his sister who is a drug addict by the way. He does not care too much about leaving his siblings and mother, but he does care a lot about this one sister who has been going through a lot as well. And he also cares about his father as we see towards the end, even if he is not father-of-the-year candidate, but in a way he was the one who taught Fresh how to make the right moves. On the chessboard or in real life. You can see how much he cares when he starts crying for the first time pretty much and this is when the movie ends and it hurts him that the only way to get out is by leaving his dad behind. That was one of the most touching moments the film had to offer. Speaking of chess again, I must say I really hate lightning chess or whatever the name is. It already stresses me out to only watch them play like this. I need time to plan my moves when I play, but yeah there are other references here. Some names are mentioned as well, most of all the legendary Bobby Fischer.What else can be said about this film? It is a fairly long film and much closer to the two-hour mark than to the 1.5-hour mark, even closer to two hours than to 100 minutes, but still not an extremely long movie. I would say the running time is accurate and how it should be and I would not have cut more than five minutes. Admittedly, if I have to look for flaws here, then I would say that maybe, as smart as the kid may be, it is just not realistic how he is literally such a perfect schemer that he manages to take them all out one-by-one. And also that he survives it all. Nobody, not even 99% of adults, would have been this good in pulling all the right strings, so maybe the film is not the most realistic overall, but it is not too difficult to look beyond and ignore that for the most part because it is an entertaining watch, even if this is probably not the best adjective to describe the movie. Awe-inducing sounds fine. You will not find any spectacular careers here with the exception of the two I mentioned early on. The one who plays the cop that helps the boy or wants to help the boy was in ""Twilight"" at least"". For lead actor Sean Nelson this was not the first role of his career, but the first big-screen role and still the defining performance of his career. He even got a bit of awards recognition for it. Most of the other went to Yakin. Esposito also got in once and the film itself also made it to Cannes. But as for Nelson, this will probably stay the biggest role of his career. He appeared on many television series in the last ten or even twenty years, but usually only one or two episodes per show. Still nice to see he keeps acting, even if he has turned into a bit of a journeyman. He is in his early/mid 40s now. Who knows what will come, so I shall not judge too early.In any case, I don't regret it that I went to check out this film. It was probably not at all what I expected, but it is definitely worth seeing and my positive recommendation was never in doubt here. It is still definitely not a film you wanna see if you are in the mood for a feel-good film. Other than that, it is a good choice and I wish the room could have been more packed during my screening. But from what I have seen so far, the entire retrospective was not exactly a crowd magnet so far (except ""Do the Right Thing""), bit I will wait my final judgment there as well until I have seen some of the other films on my list. It is still awesome that something like this, a film like this is shown on the big screen again. Shown on the big screen in a country far away from America. That is almost it then. Let me say before I come to the end that the acting is good all along here and I am still surprised that neither Nelson nor Yakin didn't have bigger careers. If you really want me to name a moment that made me smile when there wasn't really any, I would perhaps go with the scene in which the protagonist beats the random guy at chess there in the park and the man clearly underestimated the kid and of course the boy's father was also watching there, so in a way you can say that he also wants his dad to be proud of him. The tears in the last shot of the movie are telling enough and imply the same. So yeah, it's a thumbs-up from me for this actually really decent movie. Not a must-see, but I say: Go watch it."
tt0114369,"When audiences went to see the latest production of a tragedy by William Shakespeare at the Globe Theatre, there was a universal reaction by the spectators to what they were seeing on the stage. It was one of sadness, anger, sympathy and relief. The sadness was normally due to the innocent victim (who was usually a beautiful woman) being murdered in an unjustified fashion, such as Desdemona in 'Othello'; the anger would have been directed towards the villain in the play whose dastardly deeds had resulted in the deaths of heroes and heroines - here we have Iago, arguably the most evil character in the history of literature ('Othello' again); sympathy was not for the devil, but for the poor people who had overcome the denouement but had to deal with its consequences (Horatio perhaps in 'Hamlet', or maybe Father Laurence in 'Romeo and Juliet'); and lastly relief was felt because the audience had survived the play's violence and could thank their lucky stars that they did not have to live in a world so cruel. Now stay with me here, because there is, in fact, a point to all of this. I believe that Fincher's 'Seven' is the modern Shakespearean tragedy, the modern 'Titus Andronicus', if you will. The feeling that washes over you when the credits roll in Seven (which are damn good credits I might add, start and finish) is on a par with a great Shakespearean tragedy, and it is for this reason why I think that films such as Seven should be considered as more serious in a literary sense. Not only that, but the film even introduces the audience to legendary texts such as Dante's 'Inferno' and Geoffrey Chaucer's 'The Canterbury Tales' - so I would be inclined to try and influence more English professors to watch this film.Now here's the part where I say 'Yeah Seven, woo, it's awesome! Yeah!'. I'm just going to go out and say it: this film has everything that you could possibly be looking for when watching a movie. The script, for one, is great. Original, funny in places, exciting, sexy...the list is endless really. Well played Andrew Kevin Walker; the boy done good. Next we have the acting which, to put in a Romantic sense, is sublime: people may argue that Morgan Freeman can only play one character, but I think it's similar to the situation with Hugh Grant (his one persona may be a bumbling, lovable fool, but he is damn good at it) and it's the same for Morgan. Here he is at his fatherly, worldly-wise detective best, and the comic double act of Freeman and Pitt is essential to the film. Pitt's performance is probably just about overshadowed by his portrayal of Tyler Durden in Fincher's other chef d'oeuvre 'Fight Club', but in no way is this a demeaning statement to Pitt. He is, or was, one of my favourite 'younger' actors (that's the Ed Norton, Johnny Depp ring, as opposed to the Pacino/De Niro/Hoffman circle of expertise) until 2005 came about - Ocean's 12, to put it mildly, disappointed me greatly. However, let's think positively: with Seven and Fight Club and Snatch, I'm sure Brad has something in store for fans like me. Gwyneth Paltrow is probably the unsung hero, or heroine, of the film and ironically she's the one who gets it worst (or does she? Refer back to tragedy point about sympathy). The words 'never better' spring to mind when thinking about Paltrow's 'Tracey'. There's someone else I'm not mentioning here, despite the 'contains spoiler' tick, but let's just say he/she/it provides, in my eyes, the greatest twist OF ALL TIME. Last but not least, David Fincher is where it's at. His undoubtedly cool style is the reason why this film is so...cool, for want of a better word. Thanks to him, Morgan Freeman is cool, Gwyneth Paltrow is cool, the man who works in that horrible place where the 'Pride' crime takes place is cool, even the man/woman/thing with no name is cool (to a certain extent).To conclude, there are certain films that when the credits appear at the end, you think to yourself 'That has to be the best movie I've ever seen'. 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'L.A. Confidential' are prime examples. In my opinion, 'Seven' epitomises this type of film."
tt7286456,"I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story. It's dark depressing movie, about a guy who's dealing with bipolar disorder and killing everyone around him, including his Mother. What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society."
tt0110912,"This film is one of the greatest ever with awesome direction and superb writing, particularly the scenes involving John travolta and uma. Introducing a style which has been replicated countless times (snatch, bad times at el Royale)"
tt0137523,"A difficult to understand film, that borders boring at some points, the fact that it has such a high rating is quite mind boggling. At some points interesting, but not the most thrilling piece of cinematography that I've seen, plays with the psychological aspects of humanity, and in the end is a confusing expo of a delusional persons realty, illustrated through ""fighting"" with ones self and then recruiting others to demonstrate similar violence as if it were to contribute in the bettering of individuals who ultimately degenerate in a seudo-terrorist activity and is only ended when one of the two polarities of the protagonist, causes a shot to his head, ending the personal torture of enduring this film."
tt0167261,"A surprisingly bland and childish adaptation of Tolkien's legendary epic. I felt I was watching a Disney film. The talents of Lee and McKellen are wasted here. Jackson has already shown with ""Fellowship"" -- a superior film -- that he understands Tolkien and knows how to translate his works to the big screen. But with ""The Two Towers"" he takes literary license too far. Skateboarding elves and wisecracking dwarves, is that all it takes to defeat the Uruk-hai? What gives with Aragorn and the pseudo love triangle? These are distractions. Oh, and how about putting some emotional impact back into the story? I want to empathize with the main characters. Still, I'd forgive all its defects in a heartbeat if wasn't so boring. 6/10"
tt0422272,"I just hope God gives me an extra 100 minutes to live. Because this was by far the worst movie I've ever seen. In one word: terrible. I just wonder what the writer of the story was thinking when he was finished. Did he think: ""Good job????"" I'm having troubles believing that. I also wonder why in gods name one would agree to play part in something like this after reading the script. If you liked Calista Flockheart as Ally McBeal don't go see this movie, cause your opinion of her will change for the worse. If you didn't like her as Ally, don't go see this movie, it'll make you feel even worse 'bout her. The story makes no sense, acting is bad and the special effect were very low-budget. PLEASE DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID, WHEN YOU SEE THIS MOVIE IN YOUR LOCAL CINEMA, VIDEO RENTAL PLACE OR EVEN ON THE INTERNET.....WALK ON BY AND SAVE YOURSELF 100 MINUTES!!!!!!!!"
tt0422272,"With its dreary, desaturated pallet and stock scares, Fragile is a solidly executed genre film, which takes full advantage of its inherently creepy setting (an isolated, out of date hospital) and successfully builds drama and tension. Although its exposition and dialogue are occasionally clunky, the film's plot twists are surprisingly effective and well timed, and its monster becomes more and more frightening as themes of body horror and child endangerment intensify toward its frantic climax and sentimental ending."
tt0068646,Nice one. I recommend must watch. I saw this 1000 time.
tt1345836,"Much like Zack Snyder's Meh of feels, TDKR is a bloated, incoherent mess. It's obvious that Mr. Nolan was forced into directing this movie so he could make interstellar. The film feels rushed and is poorly edited. There is a moment near the end of the film where a character says that they have 21 days till a bomb goes off. Then, literally in the next scene, they say they have 5 hours till the bomb goes. Apparently this film has a floating time line inside it's ridiculous running time. So many inconsistencies and plot holes that took me out of the film. Sure, the dark knight had some plot holes, but it never seemed to break the rules of the universe it was set in. This film breaks the rules established in the previous films in every scene. How did nearly every single cop in the city get lured into the sewers in the first place? They couldn't have a drone or a robot check and then send a swat team down? This film also has the distinction of being too long and not having enough in it. There must be scenes on the cutting floor that would've made some of the stranger and downright stupid parts of this film make more sense. The best parts of this film are the parts I was skeptical about. Hathaway's Catwoman is fantastic and fits well in this universe, as does the menacing Bane- who Tom Hardy emulates with very cold and haunted eyes. The fight scenes are great, and the acting is top notch. But something seems...Off. The writing is more on the nose than in the dark knight, and some parts don't add up. The pit in this movie seems like it belongs more in Inception.The ending to this movie is what really ruined it. Another race against the clock climax that's been done ten thousand times before. The 'twist' could have also been done better. The most disappointed I had ever been in a sequel until the force awakens was released. A 5 out of 10 for Chris Nolan's worst film."
tt0137523,I can't believe how many people actually like this film....... I can't believe how looooooonnnnngggggg and boooooooooring it was. It was the strangest and weirdest film I'd ever seen. Everything that happened in this film would never happen in real life ever. Even the ending was the worse ending to a film. I'm speaking from a girls point of view tho ... Girls it is rubbbbbishhhh. It's more of a mans wishful way of thinking. This film I'd say was probably brad Pitts worse films he has done. A good film he was in was SNATCH. I'd recommend that film over this anyday. A film this long should be capturvating . I was waiting for it to get better then the ending come and I thought I can't believe I just sat here and watched it. Very strange very weird and would never happen !!
tt0313792,"In a few of Woody Allen's films, he teaches us a lesson. Here, Allen teaches us a good lesson: It's never good to cheat on people. As you see in this film, Anything else. Allen also has a way of changing genres as the movie goes. Like with my favorite Allen film, Match point. It starts off as a romance, then turns into a drama, then a suspense. Well, he doesn't exactly do that here, but he still does a good film.I am not that fond of Jason Biggs. That is the main reason why I didn't believe that this would be a good film. The only reason. Allen usually does great movies. Usually, I can't give any of his movies less than a 9. Cause they are usually that good. What's weird is that I think that his newer stuff is a little better.Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed Annie Hall, but I have to say that it's a little overrated. Manhattan was terrific. I really enjoyed Broadway Danny Rose too. I also really liked Mighty Aphrodite too. But Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Match point are one of my top three favorites.Anything else is the story of a man named Jerry Faulk(played by Jason Biggs). He writes skits for comedians. Him and his crazy friend(played by Woody Allen).Allen is funny as usual. Jerry, one day, meets his friends girlfriend(played by Christina Ricci) and the two fall madly in love.His problem is that he can't say no to anyone or end it with them. But he's together with her for a while. They both cheated on their lovers from the past. And eventually he realizes that he has made a mistake.I really liked this movie. I don't really like Jason Biggs, but here he's actually not that bad. But he isn't a good person. Christina Ricci is actually a bit of a bitch, which is a little different. I forgot to mention another great actor in this movie. Danny Devito is very funny as Jerry's manager who he doesn't need or like but can't get rid of him.Allen is a great director. After only seeing ten of billions of his films, I am very convinced. Alright, he might be an atheist pervert but he's a genius actor and director. And like all of his films, you've got to see this one.Note: I actually have two accounts. The other automatically logged me out and I didn't remember the password. My other account is also Sirus the virus. But really I don't know who cares."
tt7286456,"Gotham is in dire difficulties like New York City back in the 70's. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a mentally unstable clown. He laughs uncontrollably in stressful times. He gets beaten and robbed by a group of youths. He gets fired from his job. He lives with his unstable sick mom (Frances Conroy) who worked for Thomas Wayne and claims him to be her ex-lover and Arthur's biological father. When Arthur is attacked by three drunken suits in the subway, he shoots them dead. Thomas Wayne is outraged by the killing of these three well-educated pillars of society and announces his campaign for the mayor's office. Arthur has a relationship with his single-mom neighbor Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz) and admires talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro).This is great character work from Joaquin Phoenix. He is one of the great actors working today. Director Todd Phillips is pounding his chest a lot and deserves some praise. I do have a couple of problems with his work. The smaller problem is the continuous shooting of Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne with her pearls. That scene has been done so many times in the past three decades. It may be better to simply suggest it with a clown walking into the alley with a gun. Don't show the shooting. Just do the sound of the shot and leave. It's all been done before and Phillips should know this. The bigger issue is setting up this world. I think Phillips expected that the audience knows this world as a given. The streets have lots of garbage. There are news reports. Phillips fails to spell it out especially if income inequality is such a big theme in the movie. It needs a Wall Street protest or two. At least, there should be a protest in front of Wayne Tower. The first clown protest against Wayne seems to come out of nowhere. The hatred of the rich needs some background. Overall, this is a great new needed voice in the comic book superhero genre which presents ground to build a new franchise on."

tt0133093,"The Matrix (1999) is basically the idea of The Matrix, an ultra- computerized sci-fi film by Andy and Larry Wachowski that has an excellent concept but squanders it by falling back on the same old tired action movie conventions. The Wachowski siblings have given us an hour's worth of excellent cinema, filled with fascinating ideas.The film begins where We start with a woman named Trinity (Carrie- Anne Moss), who seems to be on the run from a gang of Men In Black- types led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). Luckily, she can leap tall buildings in a single bound, run around on the walls, and so on. So she gets away, but not before contacting a computer hacker named Neo (Reeves) by sending him a cryptic message on his monitor. Following her directions, Neo meets up with Morpheus (Fishburne), who is in charge of a ragtag team of humans from the late 22nd century. And why did Morpheus seek out Neo and bring him up to speed? Because Neo is The One; he's the messiah. He's going to save us all."
tt0172495,"There is a lovely film in here about a spoilt brat teenager who unfortunately has tyrannical rule over the Roman Empire.  So whereas most sulky boys kick tables and storm off to their room, Commodus Caesar gets to throw those who annoy and humiliate him to digitally enhanced cats. Joaquin Phoenix gives a magnificent performance, camp in the best swords and sandals tradition, throwing childish fits when he doesn't get his way, sporting marvellously gothic eyeliner (Romans vs Goths, you see), scheming elaborate punishments for his big sister, which, for him, unlike the rest of us, who get our hair pulled, can actually, horribly, be realised.It's also nice to see that the hackneyed tide of postmodernism has been stemmed Canute-like, and a complex period in Roman history, with its plagues, revolts, tyrannies and back-room intrigues and murders can be 'crystallised' in a young boy's feeling unloved by his father.  Haven't we all felt this melancholy burden at one time or another, the failure to do what is right, honourable and Stoic, when ambition and privilege seem much more immediately rewarding?Add to this the accursed, tragic flaws of incest and worse (the difference between mad tyrant and noble hero must always be expressed in terms of neurotic sexuality and fertility-turned-ascetic renunciation), and you have a truly harassed, 'modern' hero, well supported by a ripe mixture of theatrical greats (Derek Jacobi) and former 60s icons (Oliver Reed, David Hemmings - is this Scott's THE LIMEY?).  He gets to watch some champion gladiating too.Of course, a film of this stature, size and scope must inevitably have its longueurs, here an elaborate sub-plot involving Russell Crowe, an inexorable melange of MAD MAX/BRAVEHEART (noble hero turned insane revenger after wife and family slaughtered; the bleak landscapes witnessing vastly scaled pub brawls; the lengthy, dimly lit, self-agonising indoor scenes, as a 'man' debates within himself his 'man'liness and duty; the loaded dichotomy between caricatured, vicious Imperials and unswervingly decent warrior; buddy-buddy development; Godardian, alienating, swelling score) and SPARTACUS (the violent gladiator scenes; the chinned sincerity; the captive peasant taking on the might of the Roman Empire; the structural homophobia).Crowe is a revelation - and reveals a hitherto unmined talent for comedy and parody.  Of course, this works because, like Leslie Nielsen, he marshalls a tautly disciplined straight face, but his clenched surliness, his Heston-like intergrity, his attempt to absorb the Stoic precepts of Marcus Aurelius (his scenes with Richard Harris are worthy of that masterpiece oof classical epics, CARRY ON CLEO), his reciting dialogue Abrahams-Zucker-Abrahams would have been proud to have written, are so funny (the scene where he rises off the ground of the auditorium to 'meet' his family is pure comic genius), so expertly pomposity-bursting, so winding up the pretensions of an entire genre, I emerged from the film with great respect for this stunningly versatile, deceptive actor.He couldn't have done it, though, without the help of Ridley Scott, essaying another mass culture in decline, who has bravely exorcised the complexities, ambiguities and enigmas of BLADE RUNNER to create an admirably simplistic epic, to abandon the weight of historical validity in favour of Boys' Own fantasy.  It would have been easy with this budget to create a teeming, living, authentic Rome, but Scott the postmodernist recognises the impossibility of this project, and, in an act of avant-garde innovation, hangs his drama on a handful of geometric signifiers, with little relation to any reality beyond the drawing board.There has been an extraordinary , and for me higly promising, strain in modern Hollywood filmmaking (eg TITANIC, THE PHANTOM MENACE), in which the new digital technology is not used to create novel, vast, convincing, strange worlds, but to elucidate the principles of Brechtian epic theatre, to foreground artificiality, implausibility, soullessness, encouraging the audience out of the narrative, to stand back and reflect on issues such as the construction of history, mass spectacle etc.  The dreams of the New Wave may finally have come to fruition.Like most films of this type, GLADIATOR is about a hero who is too good for his society, who cannot live in it.  But is he?  The absence of historical verity in the story set me thinking to about what Scott was trying to say. Because the film is a story about a man who lets his family die, who isn't there for them.  This is a curious hero to celebrate, though appropriate in an age where fathers often abandon their families, even to the extent of not paying alimony.  After Maximus (Scott must have been a Monty Python fan) sees the charred crucified bodies, the film goes momentarily into dream mode.  But does it ever come out of it?  This is a story that is full of doubles, strange correspondances, mirror scenes; it thoroughly interrogates the nature of family, and finally reaches a ritual climax in which both sides of the same coin (sons) wipe each other out, like Gothic doppelgangers.  Is the whole film Maximus's guilty dream, about guilt, emasculation, eternal torture over failure, the descent into bestiality? Is it a theme of America's guilt over slavery and subsequent race traumas, or a renunciation of them (both whites and blacks are slaves here).  Whatever. This is the first great comedy of the millennium."
tt1375666,"This is just an average big budget Hollywood movie.Don't expect any complexity or depth from it, it is simple and quite shallow.Technically it's well done, the plot is OK, the actors are fine, the FX are good and hopefully you will have a good time watching the characters running and jumping around, ducking bullets and explosions and so on while a VERY SIMPLE AND QUITE SHALLOW psychological-scifi plot unfolds.But you won't get much else from it.I'm giving it a 7. So folks, don't believe the hype about this thing being a fascinating and revolutionary piece of art, because IT'S NOT. It's just another Hollywood commodity out to make big bucks. If you want some enlightening psychology read ""?"" and don't watch this, for ***ck's sake.There are some really cool effects to this film, but the story is so convoluted that it detracts away from the story."
tt0372784,"Just returned from my very first press screening (thanks to my movie-geek brother having a football tournament today *g*) - and I've got to say, there's something to be said for seeing a movie without commercials and noisy teenagers¬Ö Especially when it's as atmospheric as Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan's vision of how the Dark Knight came into being.I must admit right away that I'm not a real Batman fan - I've seen the Burton/Keaton movies and remember enjoying the old TV show, but that's pretty much it. But I was definitely impressed by this movie and enjoyed every minute of it. Christian Bale makes a beautifully tortured Bruce Wayne and his journey towards becoming Batman rang true. Most of the other characters were also perfectly cast ¬ñ especially Michael Caine as Alfred brings humanity (and humour) to an otherwise pretty dark movie.The only things that can be criticized, in my opinion, are the moments when the movie takes itself too seriously and falls for some clich√©s, which admittedly are hard to avoid with a well-known topic like this. Also, I wasn't too impressed by Katie Holmes as the obligatory (and way too young-looking) childhood sweetheart/damsel in distress. But that might just be me and shouldn't stop anyone from watching this.Batman Begins sheds some interesting perspectives on Batman's past, especially by introducing some of the familiar faces and names in a manner that didn't feel contrived but improved the story (other than in a certain space saga, one might be tempted to say). Awesome popcorn cinema, with a realistic and yet fantastic feel that draws the viewer right into the dark alleys of Gotham City"
tt1853728,"First I must say that I'm not a big Tarantino fan anyway. I really like Jackie Brown, but the other Tarantinos I saw could in my opinion never live up to the hype that was made about them.Now Django is not much different. It's not really catastrophic. It actually is even funny in quite some scenes. But I still don't see what should make it from the solid B-Movie it really is to the masterpiece that a lot of people want to make us believe it is.I like the humor, I like the music and I like some of the homages. But it's too long and it isn't enough compelling or intelligent to make it a really good movie."
tt0172495,"Gladiator is one of the best movies of a generation. Each and every element is a masterpiece, the story is extraordinary, the visuals of the movie are incredible, the soundtrack as well is heartouching and moving.Gladiator is a cinematic masterpiece that leaves it's audience awestruck and deeply moved. From it's impeccable storytelling to it's spectacular action sequences, this epic historical drama proves to be an unforgettable experience that surpasses all expectations. The action is powerful and the story is strong and serves as a great object lesson. The costumes, set and every other detail is simply astonishing."
tt7286456,The depth of the story was lacking to much focus on such a short aspect of the jokers life and he became the joker there was not much of a journey. The constant musical score was over dramatic and did not add much to the film if anything it detracted from the movie. All the actors performed excellently but this is not a movie to be entertained by our top be taken in by all the characters as the focus is so much on one person without a real journey.This is my opinion as my partner really thought it was a good movie. In the end I could not wait for it to be finished I think the character of joker has been devoured from the comics and previous movies.
tt0816692,"Interstellar - ReviewCertain things in life are precious. Very precious. And so was the Film for me.Why you might ask?Well seldom do i get the chance where i find myself sitting in a cinema anxious and intrigued by what might come. In a time where trailers are omnipresent and going to the movies without having seen one seems unreasonable, outright stupid to some i had the magical chance to find myself in front of the IMAX on a cold November night with 2 tickets to Interstellar. My only knowledge was that Nolan directed it and McConaughey stars in it.The images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by Hans Zimmer and his Music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. And there it was.. The ending. I couldn't believe it . I was reliving, rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment, the smell of popcorn, my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? Ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes....Well apparently people enjoy movies different than i do. Maybe i should start watching trailers again :)."
tt1375666,"Boring movie with no meaning and only a few fancy special effects. Special effects were not even all that good. Just a few slow motion anti-gravity scenes. Even the Matrix would have been boring without some kind of ""meaning of life"" stuff. You need more than star power to make a good movie. I kept thinking the movie would have intriguing thought provoking idea, but it was so predictable. It turned into a real snooze. The premise of the movie is not enough to carry the entire movie. Using dreams to influence behavior is a concept that has been used many times effectively. Such as SG-1 when the Harcesus teaches Daniel that power would corrupt him through a dream. But this movie has no uplifting message."
tt0111161,"With universal themes such as redemption, friendship, and good-defeats-evil tale, and without any significant technical flaws, it may be difficult to dislike Shawshank Redemption, one of well-done Hollywood flicks in the 90s by invisible employee directors, while it may also be difficult to find it compelling, imaginative, and inspirational. Despite a prison situation Tim Robbins keeps looking ridiculously gorgeous all the time, but this is made-in-Hollywood."
tt0110912,"I like it, it was very good. Uma Thurman sexy as ever, Travolta and Jackson has a great dynamic and Willis is good too. I don't really understand the point of having three stories interwoven together like this, but it was kind of cool to see them overlap.Good film!"
tt0361748,"Okay ‚Äì here's the story, in a paragraph: a bunch of American soldiers terrorize German infantry for years, in France, behind enemy lines. They become infamous to the Nazis, resorting to intense cruelty to the Germans. Even der F√ºhrer wants them caught. Meanwhile, in a French town, a lovely French-Jewish femme fatale plans to blow up her cinema when a famous German action flick is shown to the German hierarchy ‚Äì including Hitler, Goering, Goebbels and Borman. Coincidentally, those infamous American soldiers are sent to do the same job. Also, there's a very nasty Nazi colonel who just loves to hunt down and kill Jews ‚Äì and he smells a rat in the House of Cinema. How it all turns out, I'll leave up to you to discover ‚Äì that is, if you see this film.But, I don't recommend at all. Let me tell you why.First, it's billed as drama/thriller/war. Well, I guess it does contain all of those attributes, but they forgot about fantasy. Because, this story is, at core, a spoof about war and sheer fantasy, in addition.Second, in its effort to establish and develop character, it's often boring because it's way too talky for a thriller; you see character from what people do, not from what they say. Brad Pitt (as Aldo Raine) is okay as an over-the-top parody of hill-billy Americana ‚Äì and he does it well. But, even his character becomes too talky. The nasty Nazi, Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) is talky also, but at least he's a detective (in his own words), so he has to ask a lot of questions. The rest of the cast do their best with a script that varies between intense dread, only occasionally, to high camp, often ‚Äì especially concerning the German hierarchy.Third, the whole story is preposterous. Let's face it ‚Äì any war story that purports to show the entire German hierarchy being blown up in a cinema can only be regarded as coming from another planet Earth in another universe. And the (way too long) card game scene in the caf√© basement is screechingly contrived coincidence and just too stupid for words. So, if you do see it, leave believability (the prime requirement for good stories, especially war) at the door. You've been warned.And, finally, although Quentin Tarantino started well with his filmic revelation, Reservoir Dogs (1992), and followed up with his much better Elmore Leonard story, Jackie Brown (1997) ‚Äì his best to date ‚Äì this one is his nadir, in my opinion. Technically very good, especially with the editing, this basterd of a story nevertheless kills the whole experience. If he was trying to show war in the raw, look no further than the battle scenes in The Thin Red Line (1998). If he was trying to create a thriller, stay with the Bourne franchise. If he was attempting drama in war, watch From Here to Eternity (1953) or Twelve O'Clock High (1949), and too many other superior films.To be fair, it has its moments: the frenetic shootout in the caf√© basement is editing at its best. And the opening scenes at the French farm are a tour de force in building dread. However, the cardboard cutout characters left me totally indifferent to the fate of any of them: in sum, a dead story about death at its worst. It'll be interesting to see if Christoph Waltz gets the Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor. Miracles do happen, though.I note that Roger Ebert gave it four stars. Is that out of ten? I hope so ‚Äì I give it four also.Oh, heck, see it if you must, but just keep in mind it's a fantastic spoof."
tt0146414,"The film begins with a nasty trader trading folks new lamps for their old ones. He's not doing this to find the magic lamp...he just uses his little slave boy (Aladdin) to clean them up to resell them. However, as Al is wiping one of them clean, a Genie pops out and begins granting him wishes....and Al uses this to try to get the Sultan's daughter in marriage (which is odd since they both are kids). Unfortunately, the slave owner returns and fights Aladdin for the lamp.This is not a great cartoon by any stretch. But the animation and color are very nice and the film is modestly entertaining. And, fortunately, unlike Ub Iwerks' poorer films, it's not saturated by cute singing characters."
tt0137523,"Movies like this are intensely frustrating. They get so close to the greatness mark, enticing you with how good they are, and then, at the last second, as if to spite you, they pull back and go for the Hollywood ending. And then you almost forget the brilliance of the rest of the movie. And any filmmaker that can come close to blocking out the memory of the great parts of his movie with just one crucial scene needs to be beat up. Or have his face shoved into Meat Loaf's man-titties.But I can mostly forgive David Fincher for leaving that copout ending simply because the rest of the movie is so darn good. This seems to stem mostly from Jim Uhls's close adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, a masterpiece of existentialist grit and wit. The film follows the book through most of its plot, incorporating much of Palahniuk's clever and bitter commentary on our material society into Edward Norton's jaded voice-over narration, which is unnerving for the five seconds it takes to get into the rhythm of the story. That's how good this plot is adapted- we can settle right into a rhythm and a dark tone that match those of the book perfectly.Edward Norton is the perfect choice for Fight Club's bored protagonist, as is Brad Pitt as Tyler, the enigmatic man that encourages Norton's character to join him in starting a fight club. In this club, men come to the basement of a bar and essentially beat each other up in an attempt to reach into the core of their manhood (the screenplay says it with far more deftness than I do). But it's about so much more than the fight club, as Norton's narrator soon discovers. Tyler has a plan to change the very fabric of their society and in the process changes the very fabric of Norton's character's life- more than he realizes at first.For the entire movie, Fight Club is about man's slavery to society and his escape from it. Unfortunately, the ending, which I won't spoil, takes an entirely different direction from this theme, and, as a result, takes the movie an entirely different direction from greatness. The ending of the book, however, is perfect, and if Fincher had stuck with the book through the entire first two hours of the movie, why couldn't he use the book's perfect ending for the last 10 minutes?It's still a must-see though- the ideas expressed by this movie are some everyone should hear and ponder. Plus, it's freaking good entertainment."
tt0816692,"Just watched this in New Zealand. The IMDb rating is still above 9 at the time. Not sure it will stay there though. It's not a bad movie but it's not a great one either (which a 9 should be). It's creative in terms of story but it is drawn out. It goes for the Gravity look and feel, being slow, filmed in space and with dialog often replaced with music, but it does not have the suspense of Gravity. It's doesn't draw you in. It just doesn't have enough substance to carry it off. It has plenty of promise but lets you down in the end, especially once you pull all the pieces together to formulate what's going on. It's still worth watching, at 7/10, just don't expect a 9/10."
tt0167261,"Everybody talks about The Two Towers (TTT) and I must agree that this is one of the top movies this year. But... I regret to say that I am pretty disappointed. Why? In TTT, compared to the Fellowship, there is more action, the story is faster, but... Forgive me but this movie is simply more ""american"" than the first part. There is a lot of computer graphics, a lot of characters, a lot of... everything. It is pitty that all this stuff draws attention away from the point. I encourage everyone to read the book (and to think about it not just ""eat"" everything they serve you)."
tt0068646,"2/3 - acting
1/3 - storyline
1/3 - cinematic.Start of really good and I lose interest in around 1/4 part of the movie, and completely disappointed. If you like movie like selling drugs and more actions I think it is not for you or indeed I'm really not into action movies."
tt0313792,"Even mediocre Woody Allen is better than mediocre anything else, it turns out.I was slow to warm to ""Anything Else"". The biggest problem was Jason Biggs as the main character, probably the role that Allen would have played himself if he had been young enough.How do I know that, aside from the fact that it was written by him?Because Biggs acts like Woody Allen does. He's the typical fretful nebbish who talks talks talks and backs into every situation complaining.Woody Allen can get away with this act because it's his act. But Biggs, I don't know.Biggs plays a struggling comedy writer who is locked in an entirely ridiculous relationship with the beautiful Christina Ricci. In a questionable scene, she is groped by a doctor under the pretense of a medical exam, and Biggs is not exaggerating when he says that the doctor had better sex with her than he has had in over six months.Biggs is friends with an eccentric school teacher, Alan Dobel, played by Woody himself. They have conversations where Allen pontificates about the dark side of humanity in such a way that makes it impossible to get depressed listening to him.Danny De Vito is also in there, and has one interesting scene in a restaurant where he fakes an ailment.Other than this, and a few other walk-ons from such stars as Adrian Grenier and Jimmy Fallon, this is pretty much Woody Allen by numbers. Lots of dialogue, some of it clever, about relationships, philosophy, big questions. There's not a whole lot there that's truly memorable."
tt0137523,"A lot of people I know have never even heard about this film.
Good to see the system works"
tt0111161,Loved this mivue must see. This is a very interesting movie and a must see. Action packed and popcorn and chill.
tt1130884,"Shutter Island is one of the biggest loads of old tosh I've seen in a long time. The twist - if you can call it that - can be guessed from the trailer and must have been seen at least 47 movies before this one. There is a strange, artificial feel to the whole film, with the crazily doom-laden music the icing on the bizzaro cake. How this 70s B-movie script attracted Scorsese, DiCaprio, Ruffalo etc who know - perhaps it was just an excuse to camp it up for a while. That said, it entertains in its way, despite its overlength and awkward plotting. Truly a bit of a curio, no doubt it will become something of a cult 'guilty pleasure' down the line."
tt1853728,"Not being a Q.T. fan I didn't have high hopes for this film, I wasn'tdisappointed!The first scene had me expecting to see the man with no name come intosight!This said the whole film was beautifully shot.Mr. Fox not at his best which is usually very good, as for S. Jackson andhis ridiculous and obvious faux bold cap, I think that he thought hewas appearing in an episode of Planet of the apes!!!!!!!!The dentist was good, but not enough to lift what can only beseen as a weak apology for our for-fathers slavery sins!!Not for me but as I say QT fans will love it, wit(!), profanity, violence and buckets of blood."
tt0109830,"I loathe and despise this film on so many different levels.Firstly, how did Tom Hanks win an Oscar for speaking very slowly. I have never seen such a collective display of acting incompetence be so highly lauded.Secondly, The central message of this film is (spoilers) America is better than everywhere else in the world. Don't get me wrong, I like America. I love Americans, I waste massive amounts of my time and money on movies, music, and books produced in America- but this bloody movie is a typical of why so many people now seem to be anti-US. If you look at the lengths the ""good"" characters go to conform to society's ideal- his mother having sex with the principal, for example- they will behave in an immoral fashion to further their own lives within the American ideal. Furthermore, just in case this subtle point flew over the heads of the audience, the sole character to attempt to break from this conformity is killed with AIDS.Thirdly, I know it is a movie, a work of fiction etc, so there must be some suspension of disbelief, but this simply goes to far. How does a mentally handicapped kid from a redneck backwater manage to meet a significant amount of noteworthy 20th century figures, and be present at so many of the last centuries significant events? Also, why does no-one tell him where to go when he is waffling on at the bus stop?Next Up- no-one ever seems to comment on this, but this film is BORING. It is a string of randomly connected events, some of which are so tedious that when I first saw it I literally felt my brain melting. For example (spoiler) when he goes running for god knows how long for no apparent reason- then stops again for no apparent reason. The sheer pointlessness of this section made me want to cry out of frustration. This film is 2 hours and 20 minutes long- not an epic by any stretch of the imagination, but at least half an hour over time. The running section could easily (for example) have ended up on the cutting room floor without detracting from the movie in any way. This is actually typical of so much of the movie- (spoilers) Elvis does not add anything to the plot (except irritation), the table tennis scenes, the section with the prostitutes in New York, I could go on and on but frankly cannot be bothered. The basic storyline, as reliant as it is on suspension of disbelief etc, is essentially quite simple. (spoiler)Retarded boy from red neck backwater attends several famous events and through god's good graces and America's providence has a fabulously successful life, whilst losing the only woman he ever loved, and making some life-long friends. Easy, biographical story, not without a heartwarming premise. Instead we have a bloated, appalling, falsely moralistic, repugnant propaganda sequence constructed from a series of irritating set pieces and laden with pseudo-meaningful interludes. Why was it not made as a simple fictional biopic?Finally, I am not pro-feminist at all, but this movie made my stomach turn in it's treatment of the female characters. All the women of the movie are morally loose- whether it is his mother, love of his life (the only two complete female characters anyway), or any of the minor characters (two hookers leaps to mind), they all display a worrying lack of morals.Overall this movie is 140 minutes of my life that I want back. I feel violated for having seen this saccharine wrapped pile of excrement- I think I have given enough reasons for why it is the worst movie of all time without even going into it's wallowing in sentimentality, or dismal direction, or even looking at the waste of fine actors (Sally field, Gary Sinese etc). That Tom Hanks won his second Oscar for this overrated pile of garbage shows what an absolute travesty the Academy voting system is."
tt0468569,"It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all."
tt1375666,"For a film that deals in the world of dreams this film lacks a lot of imagination. I think that in being a Hollywood blockbuster it had to tick a certain amount of boxes that are necessary for the monumental amounts of money that are thrown at it.The first 30 minutes I was interested by the concept and the pacing of the film. The concept of espionage within a dream is an interesting enough concept. I was very open and excited by the idea of going into the world of dreams with the characters. I wish they could have perhaps explored a little more and pushed the boundaries of the dreams. It seemed that time and space flowed a little too seamlessly. Perhaps Kafka's 'The Trial' or a more Cronenberg style would have helped.After the first 30 minutes it sunk into the normal plodding of a Hollywood blockbuster. Are we watching Mission Impossible or a film about dreams? Unfortunately the last two thirds of the film were more Mission Impossible. I couldn't help thinking of the could have beens. All I remember is a van falling for two hours, some irrelevant action scenes in the tundra, and an in-durable no gravity scene which had me yawning.Oh and am I the only one who cannot stand Marion Coutillard?"
tt0361748,"Usually not a huge Q.T fan but this one takes the cake. It is incredible. It has everything a great movie needs.

tt0816692,"This movie felt like it tried to accomplish two simultaneous and somewhat incompatible endeavors.First, it was thought-provoking. Many questions were raised. What would life on earth be like if our climate runs amok? What happens to government when we all have to live hand-to-mouth? Are ""they"" out there communicating with us? Is it the essence of humanity to survive, or is it to pioneer, and, by extension, evolve? Second, it was also an adventure. I watched this in a full IMAX theater, with eighty bajillion watts of Super Thunder-Round Sound, or whatever the kids call it now. The visual effects definitely shine on the IMAX screen. The format switches occasionally, and usually imperceptibly, between 70mm for the scenes with dialogue, to IMAX format for that full-on dose of retina-overload spectacle. This movie is a wonderfully fun ride through a strangely familiar extra-galactic world. There are also plenty of tense moments, after which you realize you've been holding your breath.I'm glad I went to watch this. That said, I think the film suffers a little from trying to be both an adventure thrill about the dangers of space travel, let alone an actual confrontation with a nemesis, and also a multi-layered allegory involving the dimensional tangle of time, gravity, love, and what it means to survive.It asks more questions than it explores. While it fills in for the missing answers with white-knuckled brushes with death, it wasn't as intellectually satisfying as I hoped. I spent an hour discussing the thoughtful components with a friend. In the end, we were grasping to find symbolism, metaphors, or other messages about humanity. We never coalesced ""the message"" of the movie.But did we need to? It was, as I said, also a thrill ride. The adventurous climax was a little less than terrifyingly dramatic; I can't say I had the same post-climactic cathartic experience as I've had for other movies. But it was a definite end, closing most of the open plot points. I certainly felt moved by the characters' resolutions.I was suspicious that Matthew McConaughey could convince me that he was a space-ready engineer; it turns out that he didn't need to, because he did convince me that he was a dad that loved his children as much as any dad could. I think all the leads delivered solidly: Caine, Lithgow, Hathaway, Damon, Chastain, Affleck... I connected with the characters and felt their pain and happiness.Hans Zimmer played up the drama in the music a little heavily, I thought, and unnecessarily. It wound up creating the opposite of the effect I think he intended. Many of the scenes could have used a lighter touch, musically. Some of them worked brilliantly.Although I had my quibbles, the final analysis is that I would definitely choose to watch the movie a second time, but I'm not making plans to, for now."
tt0422272,"If there's one thing I really believe in, it's that all actors should have at least one or two horror movies in their resume. I loved Nicole Kidman in ""The Others,"" and Christina Ricci in ""Cursed,"" so when I heard Calista Flockhart had starred in a haunted house movie called ""Fragile,"" I had to get this movie. She plays an American nurse studying in London who is called down to help close Mercy Falls Hospital on the Isle of Wight and move the young patients to a new hospital. Her character is played with a back story we never really learn anything about, but then we really don't need to learn anything because once the movie starts moving forward, it runs forward so efficiently that it never once bogs down with exposition. The hospital Calista arrives at is old, outdated and falling apart, much like most stereotypical haunted sites, but she soon learns she is replacing a nurse who was scared so badly that she quit. In the children's ward, she meets a distant young girl named Maggie (Yasmin Murphy) who gradually fills her in on the strange stories of the hospital. Actor Richard Roxburgh goes against playing a psychotic character for once, portraying the night physician, Dr. Richard Carey, one of the hospital staff members sympathetic to the plight of the kids, and slowly delving into the location's past for the identity of the spirit. The kids are terrified by a presence they call Charlotte who is breaking their bones at night to keep them from leaving and is getting more dangerous as things keep progressing. Director Jaume Balaguero does an excellent job setting up the atmosphere and scares slowly at first and building up to a pitch where Calista's character goes from suspicious to curious and gradually terrified as she realizes the children are in danger, rescuing Maggie from the top floor as the hospital seems to crumble around them. It's everything a good haunted house movie should be; thick with atmosphere and light on the special effects with the highlights on the character performances rather than on the ghosts. Unfortunately, there is nothing here to appeal to the gore hounds that prefer blood and violence. ""Fragile"" is an intense intellectual ghost story with atmosphere, a strong cast and a top-notch plot that moves along briskly, and that is actually the best thing about it."
tt0120815,"This week, I've seen Saving Private Ryan in class. This film amazes me, like, a lot. Everything I've seen in this film, matches my own image about the Second World War. Everything that had happened in the movie, could have happened during the Second World War itself. When I currently think about the Second World War, after seeing the film, I just think about the beach-rush scene. Everything was filmed in a way like somebody was there, filming it all. Every sound you hear, every word that the soldiers say, could have been said in 1944 as well. Corporal Upham is my favourite character of the film, just because he's different than the other soldiers. He shows that he doesn't like the war, doesn't want to fight, and wants to forget it all. All of the deeds and actions shown in the film represent what could have happened in the war. I really felt like taking actions during the film, just because most of the things that happen in the movie, don't really happen anymore. This film is absolutely stunning."
tt0108052,"An epic true statement about probably the only member of the Nazi party that saved the victims behind one of the most atrocious massacre in history...and surprisingly, despite the heart-wrenching details and the inhumane deeds being presented on-screen, it gave off quite an overall positive impact too.However, It failed to be included into my top list. Considering the weight of the subject matter, i expected a lot more from this movie. I believe the movie could have investigated things deeper and further given the amount of time allocated to this movie.But it didn't, and some of the scenes behave in a way that I think it was kind of sugarcoated, or over-dramatized, that sometimes I wonder whether the scenes meant to emulate the harsh truth of war did serve their purpose. I am not saying the atrocities should have been made more gory - it doesn't need to - all I am asking and expecting is to do more justice to viewers who are relying on this movie to understand what has happened in a the full extent of this historical chapter."
tt0133093,"The first time i watched this, i was absolutely amazed with the concept of it. The action is just so amazing to watch. I've seen this film 3 times and each time it just gets better. If you like sci fi action films then this is the film for you."
tt1853728,"I wanted to see this movie for two reasons: 1) I am a big music and movie fan of Jamie Foxx. 2) I wanted to know why Nate Parker turned the movie down and seemed so disappointed in the script when he did an interview on The Breakfast Club.I didn't know the movie was going to be 2 hours and 45 minutes long nor did I care. I am not a fan of Quentin Tarantino (although I like the John Travolta parts of ""Pulp Fiction"") but I knew I was going to hear the n-word a lot from watching an interview on ""BET's Don't Sleep."" Didn't bother me. That's realistic terminology for that time period in slavery. I'm far more irritated by black folks who know the history and are brainwashed enough to think that the term has changed. I read several articles and interviews about how Leonardo Dicaprio had a hard time using the word, but he was playing a slaveowner. That word is a given. I'm a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and love quite a few Dicaprio flicks, too, so I thought, ""How could this be bad? Why didn't Nate Parker like the movie?"" This turned out to be the worst movie I've ever seen since ""Soul Plane."" Comedic timing: Quentin Tarantino did a recent interview in Ebony magazine (Dec 2012) where he said, ""One of the characteristics of my work is that I make you laugh at f***** up s***."" While there were people in the audience who laughed at random parts of the movie, I never cracked a smile. There's nothing funny to me about the Ku Klux Klan or their rambling about whether the eye holes are too short in their masks. The KKK is the most horrendous group in American history (in my opinion) and trying to make light of them seemed odd to me. Quentin Tarantino said, ""I haven't liked any of the representations of slavery that I've seen on film."" Slavery isn't meant to be liked. It's meant to be documented. You're not supposed to laugh about it or make light of it or find some amusing cowboy entertainment. It's ugly. It's graphic. It's heavy. And I truly couldn't give a damn about a horse being able to do the robot.Field slave vs house slave: Judging from the amount of lashes on Django's back, I got the impression that he was a field slave. So why this guy who didn't appear to spend any amount of time inside anybody's slave quarters could speak perfect English and read and was this brown in complexion (complexion meant a helluva lot back then) seemed odd to me. It wasn't until he reached a bar that we started hearing broken English and him saying words he didn't understand but his vernacular was way too crisp. Jamie Foxx said Quentin Tarantino told him he needed to act like a slave. Django was someone I could see strolling down the street in 2012 -- just with outdated clothing on -- if you heard him speak.Black man on a horse: As hard as Quakers had to hide themselves from affiliation with the Underground Railroad and with the amount of covering up even after the Emancipation Proclamation, racism was more harsh, more violent and more impulsive. So how in the world this random black man could roll through town on a horse and not be shot dead before anybody even asked his comrade why he was there was beyond me. You know how you see action movies and think, ""This guy would be dead in three minutes if this was real life""? That's how I felt about Django as soon as he grabbed the winter coat and boots.Leonardo Dicaprio and Samuel L. Jackson: These were the only two characters in the entire film who seemed realistic. Sam Jackson's character was definitely a house slave (and ironically enough he spoke English in a more broken manner than this obvious field slave Django). Dicaprio wasn't kidding when he said his character was horrible. There were moments when I flinched at some of the stuff his character smiled about, but I was finally starting to get into the film. Same for Sam Jackson.Kerry Washington: I just found it odd that she went from being in a box and splashed with water after being whipped and then walked around perfectly straight and graceful when she was pulled back into the mansion. While I understand why her character could speak German (she was another realistic house slave) and even why she seemed a bit more cultured than other slaves, I can't see someone being whipped and caged like an animal and then bopping around a dining room like nothing happened.Bounty hunter scenes: I get why there had to be a bounty hunter plot in order for the relationship to make sense and the rescue-the-wife part, but the bounty hunting scenes were so dreadfully boring. The movie didn't pick up until it started at Dicaprio's character's plantation.Music: Every time there was a serious scene, there was this obnoxious cowboy music or really upbeat music that contradicted what was going on. It's like playing a techno song in the middle of a guy getting raped in prison. The music never matched the scene. Has Tarantino ever heard of spirituals? Pick one.The entire film made a mockery of slavery and should've never used that topic. It was basically a cowboy movie with chains. And I hated it. And I'm incredibly annoyed that I ruined part of my Christmas evening paying $8 to see this stupid film."
tt0133093,"At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away."
tt0848228,"The avengers. One of the most hyped comic book movies of all time. After years of build-up with solo movies, the avengers is born. Is it good? does it still hold up? the answer is no. I admit, the first time i saw this movie in theaters, i was having a blast and enjoying it very much. However, the film gets worse for me each time i give it a second watch. The film is centered around Loki(played by Tom Hiddleston), who wants to take over the world, while the avengers work out their ways to stop him. It is as generic and lazy as it sounds. The film barely has any story or even character development/interaction. It's nothing but one liners and action. None of the characters have a defined personality. Tony Stark is a one dimensional clown, Thor is has the charm of a wood that speaks in a Shakespearean way, black widow and hawkeye are nearly the same, only their gender are different. Hulk has his moments, and captain America is one of the most boring comic book characters i have ever seen in this movie. It's basically a Michael Bay movie minus the women objectifying, but same level of obnoxious and out dated film making. One of the most overrated trash movies i have ever seen. This movie gets 3/10 from me"
tt0111161,"Could a movie be any more perfect? This movie is just absolutely stunning in so many ways. Acting perfect, storyline perfect, soundtrack perfect, emotional drama perfect, everything about this movie is perfect.When this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that many people expected it to. But as the years went one it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and it's popularity grew. Eventually after many years in the top 5 of IMDb's top 250 movies of all time list, it hit number 1 with over one million votes.The story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison. As the years go on in his new home he makes friends, enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie history.I love this movie. The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion.The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. And also William Sadler, Bob Gunton and many other who made this movie what it is.Overall it is defiantly the Greatest movie ever made with passionate acting, great storyline and plenty of emotional drama about how hope overcomes fear in a beautifully crafted film about the strength of the human spirit."
tt0120815,"'Great' is such a big word, you can fill it with so many expressions like spectacular, thrilling, heart-breaking, gut-wrenching, emotional, inspirational etc. etc. My problem with ""Saving Private Ryan"" is that it has all these elements but still ... at the end, I have a big feeling of 'emptiness', it's like all these things cancel each other out.The opening sequence is one of the most spectacular you'll ever see in a War movie, Spielberg knows how to deal with visual effects and the sound editing, the shaky movements of the camera gives a realistic depiction of the chaos dominating these battles, even the word 'battle' is too feeble to describe the intensity of the massacre. The sky is gray on this D-Day, the sea is reddened by the sacrifice of these young soldiers, the air is a vicious enemy that can send you a bullet where it feels like to. Your life is as worthless as money in a lottery. Indeed this opening sequence was very promising, but I had mixed feelings after. I hoped the movie would stay in the same level of realism and greatness on one side. On the other side, I wished it wouldn't contain other sickeningly violent sequences. Unfortunately, none of these wishes were satisfied.The film flirts with fantasy right after the battle sequence, where the mission of Captain Miller's men is finally exposed. They will have to save one soldier, Private Ryan, the only one left to a family who already lost 3 sons, his brothers. To spare a tragedy for one soldier's family, eight of them will try to find him and risk their lives. We don't know this Ryan yet, he's only a name, a quest, but we get used to these characters, we follow them and have sympathy for them, but at each step of their odyssey, one will be killed. It becomes almost a routine. We're not supposed to think of their family, or the loss caused by this mission. They just die and the mission must go on. It seems that Ryan's life has more value. At this point, I remember ""Schindler's List"" beautiful statement ""Whoever saves one life, saves the humanity"" but the people who were saved, didn't choose their destiny, they were victims, the alternative was death. Ryan wanted to be a soldier, to fight, he never wanted to be saved, isn't the movie about duty, wasn't Ryan accomplishing his? So what's the point of risking the lives of soldiers who want to fight instead of looking for a man who's not a prisoner, to save one who didn't ask for it. Nonsense, and dangerous reasoning implying that some 'external' elements make your life more valuable than the others.Which in fact, brings me to the biggest problem I had with the film. Life's value. The movies tries to be inspiring by making these soldiers heroes, but to make them heroes, it creates villains by totally dehumanizing the enemy, when a War movie makes me cheer for one human being killed, I feel manipulated, and I become distant ... when a coward like Upham becomes Rambo at the end, and when Steamboat Willie revealed himself as the sneaky bastard they thought he was ... I said, okay, Spieleberg is pushing the Manichean button a little too far. Of course, when you consider the atrocities committed by the enemy, it's impossible to root for the soldiers equally, but that's the challenge when you make a war movie, you can make a Manichean blockbuster (easy choice) or a disturbing masterpiece (challenge) ... I disliked ""Saving Private Ryan"" for the same reason I loved ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", ""Paths of Glory"", ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Platoon"" or ""Das Boot"".This movie is great in all the meanings of the word and that's the problem, it's ""too great"", it tries too much ... I loved the opening scene, and another one will torture me forever, it's the scene where Melish begs for his life when he lost the fight, that part killed me ... it felt so real, I couldn't breath ... literally. To conclude, a solid block-buster movie with some unforgettable scenes but not the inspirational masterpiece they claim it to be."
tt0137523,"I won't try to write an outline of the film, others have done a good job of that here already, I'll just confine myself to observing my own reaction to it: This is one poor movie. Due to the buildup I expected something pretty good. My enthusiasm went progressively downhill as I watched the story develop and when Ed Norton performs the revealing scene (Which I suppose I should not describe here) I felt like pulling the tape out right there, I was that insulted. I am struck with jaw dropping amazement at the vote results here in IMDB. What possible value does this movie have to place it higher than so many great films in the top 250 list? I have a feeling that this flick speaks to the 16 to 21 year old male (the same group that the worlds armies traditionally love to make eager immortal uncritical soldiers from). I would like to see a demographic breakdown of the registered voters in IMDB. I get the impression that a hoard of enthusiastic male youths flooded the IMDB with high votes immediately after the release of this puerile tale. Oh well, if you want to vote this sloppy trash highly, knock yourself out."

tt1853728,"Django's luck, has taken quite a turn, the chains around his legs, have suddenly been spurned, Dr Schultz did him a favour, uncoupled him from viscous slavers, now they're off to see what bounties can be earned. The rewards are more enticing than plain cash, as they hunt down evil villains and watch them crash, their revolvers take them out, seldom having time to shout, it's akin to picking up, discarded trash. Now Django's keen to find his wife who's kept, by Calvin Candie who is cunningly adept, at keeping people tethered, disobey and they get leathered, but the duo plan to make an intercept.Great performances, great dialogue and a bountiful tale set during the less celebratory times of a countries history."
tt1853728,"You would be surprised if Quentin Tarantino ever made a truly bad movie. But he has made a few which, though not bad, are somewhat disappointing. Django Unchained is one of those. Honestly, this movie is a bit of a mess. An intriguing mess, at times a very entertaining mess. But still a mess. The movie gets away from Tarantino somewhat. His grand vision for what he wanted the movie to be ultimately lets him down. He couldn't let go of any of that vision, couldn't restrain himself. He put it all up there on the screen. And it proved to be just a little bit too much.The movie takes place in the pre-Civil War South. It is a story about slavery and Tarantino spares nothing in portraying the awfulness and brutality associated with that particular Southern institution. The hero of the piece is freed slave Django, unchained as the film's title would suggest and free to seek vengeance. But for Django more important than seeking vengeance is finding, and freeing, his wife who remains a slave. He is aided by the rather odd German dentist Schultz who does not actually make his money in dentistry. Schultz has a rather different occupation, a rather bloody one. And he is very good at his job so the bodies pile up in a hurry. Schultz, the man responsible for freeing Django, takes the former slave under his wing. Django helps Schultz do his bloody work and eventually Schultz will help Django find his wife.From its very intriguing beginning in which we meet the very mysterious Schultz the movie grabs your attention and certainly piques your interest. You desperately want to know who this mysterious man is, what he's up to. However once those questions are answered the movie begins to lose some momentum. It often feels as if the movie is just biding its time until it gets to the real story, the plot to free Django's wife. In the meantime things drag. There are a number of scenes which seem completely unnecessary. A little more focus would have done wonders for this movie. As it is things don't really perk up again until we finally, after much meandering, meet the despicable plantation owner Calvin Candie. This loathsome individual is the man who owns Django's wife. How do Django and Schultz plan to free her? It's quite the elaborate plan which, for the movie, is a bit unfortunate as it takes so much time to set the plan up. We now have the new character of Candie to interest us, and hating him is quite good fun, but again the movie struggles with pace. The big moments in this movie are big indeed. But there is too much dead space in between those big moments. At 165 minutes long this is a movie that is much too long for its own good. The crackling energy you expect to be running throughout a Tarantino film is missing. The director lost his way a bit.So there is a twinge of disappointment with this movie. But that does not mean it is a bad movie. It clearly could have been better but as is it is certainly worth seeing. After seeing it once you may not want to see it again though, it is a somewhat distasteful movie. Tarantino is never one to shy away from violence and the gore in this one is off the charts, it's a real bloodbath. It's just too much, way over the top. In and around the spasms of violence there is a lot here to recommend the movie though. It's a good revenge story, you've got heroes worth rooting for and bad guys who are as bad as bad can be. The movie is generally very well acted. Jamie Foxx as Django and Christoph Waltz as Schultz make for a very good team. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't entirely convince as the villainous Candie. It is as if DiCaprio is trying a little too hard to be evil, it comes off as being a bit forced. But in the moments when Candie is charming, and yes even this monster has his charms, DiCaprio seems much more comfortable. Notably fine work is turned in by Samuel L. Jackson playing Candie's loyal house slave Stephen. In his own way Stephen is perhaps more reprehensible than Candie and Jackson does a fine job of making that character his own. Tarantino fills out his cast well, supporting parts and little cameo roles all handled capably by a multitude of performers. All in all this is a movie with a lot of good pieces but there is the sense the pieces don't all fit together properly. Tarantino didn't make a bad movie. But he didn't make a great movie either."
tt0172495,"Gladiator has little to teach us about the past. In fact, it has little to teach us about anything save what not to do if you're trying to make a thoughtful film of artistic merit. The beginning has some promise. We are presented with the main character, a general named Maximus, who has seen battle for untold years and desires to resume his humble life as a farmer with his wife and daughter. If it weren't for his unshakable sense of blind civic duty he would have done this long ago. We see Marcus Aurelius, the old, passive emperor known for his stoicism. The movie does not paint him as the relatively aggressive imperialist he actually was, and perhaps we wonder why it doesn't, until we realize that the movie is following a simple rule: all characters must be one-dimensional. Our first impression is the correct one. There is no more than meets the eye; these people are either good or bad. For example: Maximus is good. Anyone trying to kill him, e.g. other gladiators, a.k.a. people who have probably been forced into exactly the same uncomfortable position as him, is bad. It's that simple.Gladiator does have an attention to certain historical details. The costumes, including the armor, for example, that the soldiers (Maximus included) at the beginning of the film are wearing is likely what Romans of the time would have been wearing. This is a departure from previous Roman epics, which tend to use the brass breast plate with the muscles etched into it for Roman soldiers regardless of the time period. So, score one for Gladiator, right? Maybe. But who cares, when we consider the absurd battle that follows? It quickly breaks down to a chaotic melee, with a lot of slashing, that looks completely uncalculated and un-Roman. The Romans win it easily anyway, but if they had actually fought like this they would never have been the consistent victors that they were. They had a method, and they used it, and it definitely wasn't 'every man for himself!' Another perfect example of the film simplifying history comes when Marcus Aurelius says that he wants Maximus to succeed him, so Commodus, Aurelius' son, murders him before he can tell anyone else. In actuality, the succession of the throne to Commodus was not in doubt. The film wanted to make it clear, however, that Aurelius is good, Maximus is good, and Commodus is bad.To examine the character Maximus in detail, we ought to look at his deeds. In the eyes of the filmmakers, he is without flaw. But look how he behaves!He spends the film ruthlessly seeking revenge on Commodus for the murders of his wife and daughter, and eventually his revenge is satisfied. There are no negative consequences for his brutal, murderous revenge. In fact, he gets exactly what he wants: on one hand Rome is handed back to the senate and thus becomes a republic again as Aurelius wished (and what Aurelius wants, Maximus wants because of his sense of duty). On the other hand, he is reunited with his family in death. The movie never tires of telling us that this is his ultimate goal, and then has the nerve to show it literally instead of knowing that it is understood! Remember the moment when Maximus is first handed a sword at the gladiator training camp. He throws it down in protest, either because he refuses to obey his captors or because he is opposed to gladiatorial combat (or both). Roughly two minutes later, though, he is in the arena fighting, though his life never appears to be in immediate danger, because he is so much stronger than his opponents, and such a superior strategist and swordsman; it seems more likely that he enjoys the killing. The movie refuses to acknowledge this completely, because Maximus is the hero, and a necessary condition of being the hero in this movie is flawlessness. Consider also the people he is killing. They are just like him, probably abducted or born into slavery against their will, and forced to fight, yet somehow the movie pretends that they are evil or inhuman. It masks them and makes them out to be the aggressor. At one point Maximus spares a man's life against Commodus' thumbs-down (which should have been a thumbs-up, but that's merely a historical point), but he isn't being merciful out of compassion. As a matter of fact, he is not being merciful at all! All he is doing is showing that he and he alone has complete control over whether a man lives or dies. It is sadistic.The contemporary relevance of Gladiator that I was able to uncover is its warped political perspective. Its sentiments are republican, in the Roman sense of the word, and in the sense of the Republican Party in America today. It values things like civic duty, being a manly man, a family man, a strong man, someone who isn't afraid to kill to defend¬Öwhatever. It views liberalism as controlling, preventing Maximus from living the humble farm life that he might enjoy in the state of Montana or thereabouts. It opposes sexual irregularity, and seemingly with it homosexuality. If it were aware of stem-cell research, we could guess that it would oppose it. Essentially, its year 2000 release was the perfect kickoff to eight years of hilarity with the Bush gang. A better way to be contemporarily relevant is to make a thoughtful film that asks deep questions about human nature, or the best way to govern people, or something like that, instead of flaunting some obviously hypocritical moral code."
tt0361748,"This is actually the only World War II film I found myself glued to the screen because of how fun and enjoyable this is. I believe this is one of Tarantino's greatest works from the 21st century. This film has everything, it has comedy, an excellent soundtrack and a ingenious plot set over five chapters. All I can say is that this film is just fun."
tt0816692,"Interstellar marks a critical moment in the career of Christopher Nolan; he has come a long way from being the indie noir director of Memento and Insomnia, to striking gold in the enormously popular Dark Knight franchise. Inception was proof Nolan could successfully tackle a big- budget, original idea outside of the Batman series, but with comic book films behind him, Interstellar has to sell on the promise that Nolan is not a one-hit wonder of big-budget original ideas.The movie's plot focuses on Cooper, a Southerner and family man who doesn't quite understand why man is turning away from flight. ""We used to look up at the stars and wonder about our place in the stars,"" he says, ""¬Önow we just look at the ground and see dirt."" Matthew McCoughaney shines in the role of Cooper, delivering one of his career-best. Cooper is an everyman, and nothing in this world (or any other) is more important to him than his kids; in particular, his daughter Murphy, played spectacularly by Mackenzie Foy.Despite great performances from a huge ensemble, beautiful visuals and setting, shot by first- time Nolan cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (Let The Right One In), Interstellar features a typical problem in every Nolan movie: too much expository dialogue. It is very obvious in numerous moments that Nolan is trying to feed us information and backstory. My other issue with the opening of the film is pacing. Thought the movie establishes the world and doesn't rush to do so, the movie rushes off into space the moment the idea of interstellar travel is introduced. From the first act, it is unclear whether Interstellar can deliver.It's in the second act where the movie really begins to blossom. Much of the film from this point on is set in space, and boasts mind-bending special effects as timeless as 2001: A Space Odyssey. The movie features some strikingly similar shots, clearly paying homage to the classic space opera. A lot of the shots are wonderful, and Interstellar features the best cinematography in any of his films (sorry Wally Pfister), but a few times, I found myself wondering the purpose of some of these shots of the ship ""Endurance"". Interstellar reaches for the stars, but in act two still seems unsure of where it may land.In addition to great visuals, the sound design and score are top-notch. Hans Zimmer does some of his best work, bringing in a score that is both celestial and organic; it perfectly balances tones we normally associate with outer space, while hitting all the right emotional notes. And the movie knows when to be quiet in space; not just outside the ship, but inside. I loved the moments where things were so silent you could hear the background whirring of computers, the slight creaking of the ship, the breath of the characters. The attention to detail in both sight and sound made the movie feel real.When the plot does finally introduce a ""villain"" in it's second act, the movie starts to feel it may have overstayed it's welcome. Interstellar runs at 169 minutes, and it's a long one admittedly. Cooper and Amelia, played by a well-cast Anne Hathaway, are finally forced into unforeseeable circumstances, and Christopher Nolan does not hold back. This makes for some heartstring- tugging sequences, and Interstellar may have benefited from stepping on the brakes with some of the emotionally heavy content, but the acting is so good, that it doesn't matter if it's slightly overdone, and it all builds it to a marvelous climax.Interstellar's third act is as stunning as anything I've ever seen in film. For critics who thought Inception was proof that Christopher Nolan was not very imaginative visually with free reign, Interstellar proves them wrong. Thematically and scientifically, the movie dares to challenge, it dares its audience to follow into the unknown, beyond the horizon. I am still trying to wrap my head around it all.Nolan's blockbuster epic is not perfect, and it's not for the common audience. If you're looking for big action sequences, or looking to turn your brain off for awhile, you're in the wrong movie. It's got some bumps along the way, but Interstellar is visionary for our time, and so bold in its execution, that it is not bogged down by its few flaws. I was thrilled to take the ride. Interstellar is thought-provoking, emotional, cinematic, and a wonder to behold, which in time, should earn its title in the league of great science fiction.Grade: A+"

tt0167261,"I was brimful of excitement and expectation prior to the release of The Two Towers. After thoroughly enjoying Fellowship I was told this installment would be even better as there is more action in this book than the first (I have never read the books). However I left the cinema after this film immensely disappointed.I have read review after review of Two Towers with people saying this is the best film ever. Come on, I mean seriously! Two Towers is incredibly slow and if it wasn't for the climactic Helms Deep battle would be the worst excuse for a 3 hour long film since the first 2 hours of Titanic. Even during this epic battle it is interrupted by the character which personifies the slowness of the rest of the film, Treebeard. The romance, or attempted romance, between Viggo Mortenson and Liv Tyler is so erksome and pointless I wonder if it is included because Liv complained about lack of screen time. There certainly wasn't any need for her character in this film because their romance is distinctly uncaptivating.Golum is created brilliantly and deserved the Oscar for effects but I was glad to see fhis film ignored in the other categories. I won't look forward to Return Of the King as much as this now. Disappointing"

tt0848228,"film studios just found out that a lot of moviegoers rely on ""reviews"" like internet buyers rely on customer reviews.It is known, that many big internet shops hire review-agencies those only job it is to fake authentic looking customer reviews because a lot of buyers trust the reviews of other customers more than any magazine reviews.That's what is happening here. 80% of the reviews here are written by professional review-agencies which got paid by the studios. If you look closer and compare the text of those ""best movie ever"" reviews (or variations of that, such as ""i did not expect much, i am not a superhero fan, but this was greatest beyond belief"" ) with reviews written at other moviegoer platforms, you will find a lot of equal phrases and text blocks.I guess that IMDb is aware of that cheating and they support it.This movie is another superhero movie with the very same formula. Superheros need super problems to solve, so that they can shine. Each hero has to face the kind of super problem which is appropriate to his/her individual super powers. They only can defeat the evil threat when they work as a team. But suddenly some social problems between them jeopardize the whole mission to save the humanity from that super tread, as you can guess, and only towards the end they find together again and etc., etc.. A story for retarded eight-year-old's, flavored with as much CGI as you little brain can swallow in the time.A stupid movie with a stupid story, stupid characters with stupid attitudes, stupid CGI and a stupid ending. If super stupid means blockbuster, then here you go."
tt0993846,"This was about the most unredeemable movie that I can remember. The acting was over the top with only a few bit players turning in good performances Joanna Lumley as Aunt Emma comes to mind. Jordan Belfort tells his tale of excess without remorse or humor. I sincerely hope that he had a few sober moments in the late 80's and early90's where he accomplished something good, he doesn't seem to remember any of it. Most recovering addicts that I have met have tried to honestly reflect their past and turn away from it. Mr. Belfort has found a new drug in reveling in the hangover of his past. This movie is at best an extended drug flashback, one which has nothing to say about the human condition other than that Mr. Belfort and friends were degenerate. I knew that coming in and gained mo insight other than to be skeptical if I ever meet this guy in the future.Save your money save your time even Fox News has more to offer."
tt0167260,"I still don't like these films, but this was the least intolerable of the three.  I think it had the greatest departures from the books in plot, but was perhaps the closest to the books in meaning.  I'm not even talking about all the characters and events left out; there's lots of stuff here that never happened in the book.The acting is sometimes painful.  Frodo and Sam are particularly given to intervals of mawkishness.  Gimli is shamefully used for comic relief.  The dialogue's just horrible; exposition is awkward (""A diversion!"") - I suspect the actors are giving the director what he's asked for, it's the director and writers I question.  Anyway, the adults come out okay except Eomer, reduced to mere grimacing in the background.  It's the little people who suffer.Visuals are often not to my taste, but are impressive.  Frodo always glows. Everything hobbity is very golden-lit and twinkly and twee - I think that's the worst setting mistake.  Hobbits should be those we identify with most closely, not those we're distanced from.  Minas Tirith is barely glimpsed before it's overrun by the Goths and Visigoths; Edoras outshines it.I don't like the battle scenes.  Cuts to show the sea of Orcs menacing a small city of troop of Men are unimpressive after so many repetitions, and the fighting scenes are very rapidly cut and look kinda undercranked and unfocussed, especially when using lots of CG troops.  Necessary perhaps, but it still looks bad.What was right?  They made a great scene of the lighting of the signal fires, and the relay from hill to hill, though it went on too long.  The songs were good.  The human kings rallying their troops to hopeless battles were actually magnificent.  Gandalf was less the remote magician and more the humanized power than in the first two movies.  The tone is more epic than in the first two installments - they seemed to use scale of battles and scale of scenery as a substitute for theme and pace.  ROTK didn't make me look at my watch nearly as much as FOTR and TTT.  And there's more Viggo, whom I love, but he may not be quite as good.  *sigh*Anyway, it's still pretty crummy.  Gak!  Also, I think this one would be _very_ hard to understand without having read the books or seen the first two - I wished I'd refreshed my memory of the previous movie before watching this."
tt0103103,"I always thought that the 1994 Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle ""True Lies"" was overrated - a step back into more mindless action films for Arnie after the extra-witty ""Last Action Hero"". Learning that it was a remake of a French film, and that in fact James Cameron has lifted entire sequences almost identically, certainly did not raise it in my estimation. But if ""True Lies"" was overblown, ""La Totale!"" is undercooked: it is essentially a slight, old-fashioned marital farce, punctuated by (very) sporadic action - and some unexpected blood squibs near the end. The two leads, Thierry Lhermitte and Miou Miou, are good, but the film is a little flat. Of course it doesn't help that the ""official"" English subtitles are rather poor, not making full sense at several points (example: ""c'est pas vrai"" becomes ""superway""!). **1/2 out of 4."

And if he wants us to truly understand an entirely different kind of horror, he'll show us small children leaping into a pool of outhouse waste to escape their murderous Holocaust captors.Spielberg continues what he does best with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, a film so graphic in its Second World War battlefield depictions that many veterans have called it the closest thing to being there. The explicit scenes of gushing arteries, severed limbs and faceless corpses come fast and furious, numbing us into the reality of the setting. In fact, if we didn't know Spielberg as a serious artist with noble objectives, we might be tempted to call him a shock artist obsessed with blood and guts and gore.But we do know about Spielberg. We know he would not take us down such a rocky road without a reason. In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the obvious rationale is to help us understand not where he's coming from, but where the men we will ultimately spend nearly three hours with are coming from. It's in this hell on earth that Cpt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his small group of soldiers (fine actors like Edward Burns, Tim Sizemore and Barry Pepper among them) must not only survive with sanity intact, but carry out orders. And not all of those orders make sense at the time, if ever. Case in point, Hanks and his men are sent to locate one Pte. James Ryan (Matt Damon). Pte. Ryan is no POW, but a soldier still serving somewhere within the vast U.S. Forces -- if he's still alive, that is. During the Second World War, with a communication system that is a technological dinosaur by today's standards, it's a mission ordered said than accomplished.The mission is a tough sell not just logistically, but emotionally. Pte. Ryan is sought so he can be sent home to his mom, who has just lost her three other sons virtually at once. As he himself admits, Pte. Ryan has displayed no more courage than his fellow soldiers. Why should he get to leave? Indeed that question crops up in the minds of Hanks' soldiers. Why is one man's life worth risking those of a group of men? they ask. It's an interesting angle for a film about heroes. We often think of soldiers doing the job with no questions asked, happy to put their lives on the line for their fellow GI. We forget they are rational humans.And therein lies one of the biggest strengths of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. It's a very human story told in extreme circumstances. It covers all the traditional bases -- inner turmoil, terror, carnage -- but has a level of sophistication absent from most other war films, particularly those inspired by The Last Great War. Hanks isn't Patton, but a schoolteacher who secretly cries at the enormity of it all. The enemy fighters don't have horns, but uniforms and feelings just like the Americans. The soldiers are heroes, but reluctant ones.Spielberg is a master at telling the story of war and men. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is not his best, but it certainly comes close."
tt0167260,"Before Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the world of high fantasy has not been particularly well-served by cinema. The genre was not even really taken seriously in literature until the 1960s. During the 80s, there was a fad for fantasy movies, but while most of these looked nice and were good enough fun, none of them really had magnificence (although the 1981 Excalibur movie comes pretty close). It was not until the first decade of the 20th century that we saw fantasy cinema's rather delayed coming-of-age.As with the first two movies in the trilogy the transition from novel to screenplay is exceptional. There's a lot more action and a lot less dialogue in this one, and yet the plot is still clear and the narrative never feels repetitive. The idea of binding the various story lines together in time ‚Äì such as when the Witch-King arises near Frodo and Sam, but the tower of green light is seen miles away by Pippin ‚Äì are great for building up the tension. They also really help to establish this vision of Middle Earth as a real place with vast dimensions.And again Jackson proves himself to be an action director with that little extra flair of intelligence. At first glance his work seems very much aimed at those with short attention spans, but there is so much loaded into each and every shot, the camera following an orc as he falls to the ground, or coming to rest upon a woman holding a baby as panic erupts in the city. His horror-tinged imagining of certain scenes is truly unnerving.There is some all-round improved acting in this instalment. Perhaps the years wrapped up in the production were taking the necessary toll on the cast. There are some truly heartfelt moments from Bernard Hill and a wonderfully spirited turn from Miranda Otto. For me, Billy Boyd always stood out as the finest of the hobbit performers, and this is the movie where he comes to the forefront, demonstrating great dignity and emotion. The best performance however, as previously, belongs to Ian McKellen as Gandalf. There's something strangely knowing in his final scene.One of the unfortunate things about The Return of the King is that it suffers worse than the first two movies from a lack of dignity at certain times. The CGI Gollum is too cutesy and it's hard to believe in him as an antagonist, although funnily enough the glimpse we get of partly-transformed Smeagol biting into a fish with Andy Serkis in prosthetics would have been perfect for the whole thing. Some of the most serious bits become silly. I remember laughing out loud in the cinema when Gandalf says ""So passes Denethor¬Ö"" when the man is still pathetically running around in flames.But by-and-large, this is an exceptional production, with its most outstanding touches in the way the whole thing has been put together. When the beacons are lit stretching a line across a mountain range, it's done in such a smooth, rhythmic way we are simultaneously impressed by the immense scale, the beauty of the landscape and the sheer brilliance of it as a means of communication. When Pippin's haunting song continues in the background as the men of Gondor ride off to their doom, we feel the depth of what is going on in a way the images alone could not impart. This is the kind of thinking you don't see in those numerous 80s fantasy movies, or in sci-fi's big trilogy, Star Wars. The Lord of the Rings movies put us right within both the excitement and the sadness of the story, for me with greater weight than Tolkien himself achieved. It elevates this above being merely another CGI action flick and grants the fantasy genre a status and stature it has never enjoyed before."
tt0914805,"So here we are watching home movies? No. No one makes movies like these. But here they are...and...its tough to turn away, isn't it? Thats the key behind 2007's Head Case from Anthony Spadaccini and team. And i say team because his use of ad-libbed dialog is phenomenal in this story of two mad parents bent on setting the record for homicides in the family tub. What ramps the creepiness up to 10 is their behaviour; neither over the top or demented, or mad-man speech is present. Its the very subtle interest and action these two psychos keep wrapped under their suburban-home cover. Their more interested in bickering over how to slice a stomach akin to a typical married couple deciding on where to order out for dinner. Another great use of the ""home movie"" type of filming, Anthony has shown that this is very familiar and comfortable territory, and eagerly exploits the cast and their pleasure at living out these characters."
tt1375666,"Christopher Nolan has undoubtedly become one of the most important names in the business of contemporary filmed entertainment.He has taken us to places we did not know existed.He singlehandedly revived a languishing cartoon franchise and placed it in the pantheon of unforgettable classics. In his new adventure he takes on the uncharted universe of the subconscious. The premise in its scope is intriguing and unconceivable ambitious.he relies on the best movie making talent only a major movie studio can buy to achieve his goal.The special effects are terrific, the acting is pretty good, and the dialogue is also good, but the journey that started as an unrestrained adventure into the realms of the human thought generating universe turned half way thru into a tale of semi confusing scenes. The story never comes anywhere near of seducing its audience. The emotional factor is completely absent.The movie is worth watching and it does stand out mostly due to lack of quality competition, but it should not be an Oscar nominee. Christopher Nolan has done better work."
tt0108052,"Schindler's List is an amazing story and a great documentation of how we can change as people.A man with greedy,immoral intentions can become a man whom statues are erected in honor of.Liam Neeson gives an amazing performance as Oskar Schindler,a greedy business man who uses Jewish folk as cheap labor and is totally blind to how he is helping them as a people.Neeson's slow character transformation was a thing of beauty to watch and great support was given by Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes.It is also the best documentation of just how things were for the Jewish community during the WWII era and I would highly recommend it to all who love great cinema."
tt0848228,"The ultimate superhero mash up from Marvel Studios.Following the huge success of Iron Man (Robert Downey Junior) and the relative healthy returns for the lesser known Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (now Mark Ruffalo) and Captain America (Chris Evans), the obvious monetary synergy of all four characters in the same movie is obvious.Adding to the mix, we have tight leather clad Black Widow (Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremey Renner) along for the ride, following their brief appearances in the previous films. On Bad guy duties we have Loki (Tom Hiddleston), hell bent on creating a portal to earth to allow his army of minions to flow through and capture the world, making him the undisputed leader of, well everything.On paper this should not really work, we have numerous superheroes all with very different powers, origin stories, character arcs and so forth. Somehow writer and director Joss Whedon, of Buffy and Serenity fame, manages to create a cohesive whole. Each character gets to contribute and have their moment or two in the sun, no-one appears sidelined for too long. The ultimate tag team if you will, even Agent Phil gets his chance to shine.Whedon is far to sharp to allow proceedings to get too pretentious, for every hint of comic book mythology a pin is on hand to puncture the balloon, audiences and characters clearly instructed not to take all this too seriously.Complaints, the film does feel long and there are shades of ""Transformers 3"" in the climactic scenes, have we not done organic alien monsters destroying skyscrapers?The story is largely irrelevant, all the crew are called together by Nick Fury (Samuel LJackson) in full, ""hell yeah"" mode, to defend the earth against this ultimate threat.Loki wields his staff with aplomb, initially stealing away Hawkeye and Selvig (Skellan Skarsgard). We know they are working for the wrong side due to their crazy eyes, until of course they experience some cognitive repair surgery, or get bashed on the head, dependent on your medical training.The effects are top notch, production values off the scale and it is obvious the director has a firm grip on the material and belief in his characters. All participants appear to be having a whole lot of fun and it comes across on the screen.Who would have thought a few years ago that cast lists of this quality would be lining up to play Comic Book heroes, how times and story lines have changed.So to the characters.Stark is just Stark, every mans wish fulfillment, rich beyond dreams, able to ignore anyone and everyone, good with the ladies but now settled with the radiant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Thor continues to talk in Nordic God like speak, which never gets old. The trusty hammer Mjolnir gets a good work out here, incidentally Natalie Portman's character is referenced but not shown on screen.Captain America is tried and true, embodying a dependable ""old world"" can do attitude, which is a pleasant antidote to Iron Man's showy pursuits. Evans does well here, actually anchoring the character somewhere firm amongst all the chaos.Strangely the character that should not work at all, just maybe steals the show. The ""Hulk"" whose character development in real life now has morphed through three ""A"" list actors, is the obvious crowd pleaser. He also gets the best two laughs in the film and the least expensive wardrobe, just a torn shirt and some cut off jeans.The Hulk is played rather well by Ruffalo, bringing something to the role that Norton or Bana did not find. The big guy remains under wraps for quite some time but when he gets angry, he sure makes some mess.Clearly the studio are thinking big, stay for the set up as it is clear the ""Avengers"" work is not done yet.SummaryYet another high for the comic book genre, post modern and self knowing in the approach, this works better than anyone might have dared to expect.Big, loud, expensive comic book superhero mashup. Not to be taken seriously, just enjoyed for the spectacle on show and the obvious thought, care and intelligence invested in the series.Recommendedhttp://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/"
tt1375666,"Watching Inception with its futuristic emphasis on getting inside people's heads through dreams, especially hearing Leonardo DiCaprio explain the pitfalls to newbie Ellen Page, I couldn't help thinking about Forbidden Planet and that warning about monsters from the Id. Did earth manage to conquer what the Krells could not?Christopher Nolan wrote and directed Inception and though it gets a bit heavy at times, it still is an unmistakable masterpiece. Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this and he's essentially a cat burglar of the mind. His mission usually is to invade people's dreams and steal ideas which makes him an invaluable espionage agent. But Leo's also a wanted man.Some problems Leo has relating to his Id have forced him to rely on others to create dream worlds. He was working against Japanese billionaire industrialist Ken Watanabe and got caught, but then Watanabe likes his style and hires Leo and his team to do a job on the young heir to a communications conglomerate, Cillian Murphy. It's not to steal anything, but to plant an idea in his brain with the dream team. The film is essentially how DiCaprio and his crew go about this job with Watanabe incidentally along for the ride. And its how Leo has to deal with some real demons involving guilt that force him to rely on others.Very nice computer graphic generated special effects characterize Inception and it will probably earn an Oscar nomination next year in that category. Director Nolan gets his talented cast to read writer Nolan's dialog with verve and conviction.I truly hope this technology is not in our near future that would be a frightening thought."
tt1853728,"I read & heard a lot about this movie & was anxious to watch it. But my expectations which were sky-high came crashing down in less than 3 hours time. I mean there are so many goof-ups I wonder if I ever noticed in a QT flick. The worst part is that the film though is a period drama, is far from reality & can't even be called a drama. Add to that the length, all of 165 minutes which added to my agony. I know Quentin Tarantino is a great filmmaker but with such a great cast & some decent performances, he should have done more to the weak script, mind you he is the mind behind the story & script. My verdict is 5 out of 10 only because of some great performances by Jamie Foxx & Christoph Waltz; Leonardo had nothing much do it. Way too overrated.....avoid it."
tt0120815,"War movies have often been one of Steven Spielberg' specialities. This one achieved a huge public and critic success. What drew the attention in this war movie are fight sequences. They're extremely violent and bloody. We have been rarely so far in the reality of fights. It's difficult to forget the first half an hour of the movie during the Normandy landings. Spielberg's sober and showy directing increases the phenomenon.However, you must admit it, the movie is based on a trite, plain even conventional story. You could use this last word to describe the famous Ryan soldier. Indeed, he's told that he can go home because all his brothers have been killed. Instead, he wants to keep on fighting.Apart from this and in spite of a few weaknesses, ""saving private Ryan"" is a thrilling war movie."
tt0167261,"Although undeniably brilliant to look at, the second part of the LOTR trilogy is (like the first) really just a lot of people with silly names acting out a very confusing storyline in places with equally daft names. Such a pity that all that time and effort (and money) wasnt invested in recreating a genuine historical event surrounding one of the great conflicts of the past. It is a wonder some of the actors were able to keep their faces straight while speaking some of the cod-Shakesperean dialogue. A lot of people rate LOTR as the best book ever written in the English (!) language and some already rate the film(s) just as highly - they need to get out more into the real world. Having said that, I enjoyed the film immensely and never dozed off once."
tt0068646,"What impress me most of Godfather At the wedding, I remembered, after telling the story of his family, Michael said to his girlfriend: ""that's my family, Kay. It's not me."" However, at the end of movie, he closed the door to let Kay outside."
tt1853728,"QT makes another pulpy homage to genre movies from the past. It sometimes works, often doesn't but at least it is never dull! For the most part, this movie is a solid, re-imagined western that includes black people often absent from the traditional western narrative. Great characters, great story, great action but then it all goes super pulpy with silly action. It is a pity because if QT had just pulled it back it could have been great but instead it is just great fun. The real shame is for the first half it is excellent but there comes a point when you begin to doubt that even racist evil plantation owners could have said N1gg3r as much as they do in a few scenes, then like the language the action becomes overblown.We still watch ""Man with no name"" films and ""Once upon a time in the west"" decades later, I doubt this will stand the test of time. It may seem like I am down on this movie but honestly go and see it you will enjoy it.I also think not being able to type N1gg3r on a review about a movie that says it about 700 times is ridiculous and I pity the sensitive souls who are so fragile that they allow this word to have so much power and suggest they avoid using youtube and reading the comments otherwise they will find themselves trolled by 12 year olds."
tt0284964,"An exceptionally grim slice of exploitation, LOST SOULS is undoubtedly one of the strongest films ever made by the Shaw Brothers studio, a movie that makes other violent fare such as HONG KONG GODFATHER look positively tame. It's directed by none other than T.F. Mous, the controversial Hong Kong director who went on to make the notorious MEN BEHIND THE SUN.The story here is straightforward, exploring the plight of illegal immigrants travelling from China to Hong Kong to begin better lives. Unfortunately the protagonists of our story end up being captured by some very unpleasant people smugglers who run their operation out of a run-down farmhouse.What follows is a catalogue of depravity as the immigrants are subjected to all kinds of abuse. The film wallows in sleaze and the entire cast spend nearly all of the running time naked. There's male and female rape, beatings, humiliation, and murder, including an incredibly grim scene in which a young woman is burned alive. Presiding over the carnage is Chan Shen, a familiar face from Shaw's martial arts films, and he certainly gives a powerhouse turn as a man for whom there is no limit to cruelty."
tt0120737,"The greatest fantasy epic of all times is at last a RiffTrax! No, not Crossroads - we already did that. And not A Very Unlucky Leprechaun - which we haven't done yet but are seriously mulling over. We speak of course of Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the thrilling tale of some short guys, some slightly taller hairy guys, some thin, fey, but slightly taller guys, some grungy, somewhat beefier, slightly taller guys, and a frighteningly hairy, older, slightly taller guy with a stick, and their quest to throw something somewhere hot. Mike Nelson and special guest riffer Kevin Murphy go after the ultimate comedy prize in this very special two-part RiffTrax. This RiffTrax is only compatible with the Theatrical Release, not the extended edition. It does however, work for both the single side and doubled sided versions of the Theatrical Release. Viewing Suggestion: This RiffTrax was written and performed with the whole family in mind, so if you are comfortable with your children watching Lord of the Rings, this should be perfectly appropriate for them as well. Skip the endless reruns of The War at Home and treat your whole family to the RiffTrax experience!"
tt0111161,"I found this movie to be rather trivial and predictable.  It was, in many ways, a Forrest Gump version of a prison movie.  It had a manipulative and superficial plotline, and the leading character was too good to be true. It never dealt deeply with any issue at all.  Basically, you liked the leading character because he was perfect, and cheered him on and hoped for his success, just like Forrest Gump.  However, unlike Forrest Gump, I could never see the true emotion of the Tim Robbins character.  He didn't like being sexually assaulted, but we never saw how that affected him; he didn't drink but got beers for his friends.  He finds pleasure out of the simple things and doesn't like unpleasurable things.  He turned out to be a perfect character with no negative qualities at all.  Maybe he's this way for a reason; people can relate to him because they like to think of themselves being completely perfect and think they would make every right decision if they were in a situation like this.In many senses, this was just a morality play, with Andy Dufresne being entirely good and all the prison officials being completely bad.  I think the only reason why people enjoy this movie so much is that it has the message ""Good things come to those that try and do good with their lives."" However, I didn't think the movie had enough substance to offer any deeper meaning or insight.  The best thing about this movie was it made me realize how great of a movie Forrest Gump is and how great of an actor Tom Hanks is. He made the Forrest Gump character seem to have a fully round personality and allowed us to understand who he was.  He seemed possible.  Andy seems unlikely and not relatable because we never see any reasoning behind his personality.This movie moves people because it is a heroic fable.  It's not a worthless movie experience, but it should have done more with what it already had. To the people that think this is the greatest movie ever made...spare me. My rating 4/10."
tt1345836,"Must be something about the bat-signal that causes people to up-rate blindly. This is over-produced, over-storied, and over-acted. Bale is wooden, the Bane character is stupid, the all-fists action is lame... it goes on.I watched this followed by ""Bloodshot"" (2020). The latter, at a 5.7 rating, is a much better film. Choose it instead."
tt0068646,"With a movie as critically acclaimed as The Godfather, you'd think it was the best movie of all time. Sadly, for me, this was not the case. It was a decent movie, of course; but, in the end, it had a few major flaws.First and foremost is a flaw that many may see as a great asset (thus pointing out the obviously subjective nature of movie watching): its length. Now, I have nothing against long movies, but this one just seemed to drag on and on and on. I've seen many people who made this complaint get called people with low attention spans and low intelligence; this is complete idiocy. The movie had, for all its apparent greatness, many superfluous scenes (the parts of the movie that took place in Sicily seemed particularly long and drawn out). It truly did not know when to end, and thus did not keep my interest.Another flaw was the the pompousness of the film. It truly seemed to me that every person involved was completely full of themselves and the movie they were making. It just bugged the crud out of me.Another flaw was the underdevelopment of many of the other crime bosses in the film, all of which are of course killed by Michael's men. I didn't even know any of their names, and this alone should show you how little I could care about them. A great movie makes you care about even the villains, so that their deaths are affecting.There's more I could say, but I have limited space here, so I'll just sum it up by saying that it was decent, but far from the greatest movie ever made. In fact, it is probably the most highly overrated movie of all time."
tt0111161,"The story is described by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the dividers of Shawshank Prison for quite a while and is its driving business visionary. He can get you whatever you require: cigarettes, confection, even a little shake pick like a beginner geologist may utilize. One day he and his kindred detainees watch the most recent busload of detainees empty, and they make wagers on who will cry amid their first night in jail, and who won't. Red wagers on a tall, slender person named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who resembles an innocent bystander.In any case, Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he bet. Andy ends up being an amazement to everybody in Shawshank, in light of the fact that inside him is such an intense supply of assurance and quality that nothing appears to break him. Andy was a financier all things considered, and he's in for murder. He's clearly blameless, and there are a wide range of points of interest including his case, yet before long they go up against a sort of illusion; every one of that numbers inside jail is its own general public - who is solid, who is not - and the deliberate section of time.Red is likewise a lifer. Now and again, measuring the decades, he goes up before the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and inquire as to whether he supposes he has been restored. Goodness, most without a doubt, yes, he answers; however the fire leaves his confirmations as the years walk past, and there is the feeling that he has been standardized - that, similar to another old lifer who murders himself in the wake of being paroled, he can no longer truly imagine life all things considered."
tt1345836,"Nolan's recent blockbusters stand like looming corporate architecture: shining and cerebral; stately and sexless. His scripts are like visitors' guides to these spaces, proudly explaining every detail, surgically removing every doubt. His tell-don't-show insistence is of an artist possessing consummate technical skill and curiosity, but one unwilling to allow his crafted geometric edges to be rounded off with anything approaching satire or self-effacement. Nolan's style is rigorously formal and conservative, eliding evidence of the author in favour of ruthless aesthetic efficiency. Handsome and functional but lacking personality: Apple iPod films.His sort-of-superhero trilogy began with Batman Begins, an elegant, taut, stirring comic book thriller, in which Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) struggled with his entrenched internal fears, and how to externalise them and use them as a weapon. It was followed by The Dark Knight, which had some fantastic scenes, usually involving the Joker, and maintained a convincing sense of dread up to a point. But it was dogged by hyper-plotting, scattergun characterisation and maddening verbosity - and sadly its successor continues and extends these trends.The third film is set eight years after The Dark Knight, and we meet Wayne as a limping recluse, still suffering physically and emotionally from his sacrifice. The first hour is a spaghetti mass of new characters and reintroduced characters and references to characters, but it's pretty much the same plot as Avengers Assemble, with a bad guy (in this case Bane, played by Tom Hardy) threatening to use a powerful yet unstable energy source as a weapon of mass destruction. Bane was ""born in hell on Earth"". He's built like Lord Humungous from Mad Max 2, his gas mask looks like a Predator mouth, and he speaks like Darth Vader. Not nice. Luckily Batman has help from cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), feisty rookie cop Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and the usual wholesome oldies, Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and Alfred (Michael Caine).There's a great central scene in which Batman is lured to Bane's hideout, and the two go head-to-head, elbow-to-elbow. It's the one satisfying action scene in the film. (There's nothing to rival Begins' monorail showdown or The Dark Knight's truck chase.) Bane is still a seething, menacing presence at this point. All physicality: the embodiment of rage and fearlessness. But soon after he starts speaking at length, and his voice rises and his mystery evaporates, and he becomes just a man, much less than the horrible primeval idea he'd been before. If anyone could have done with a media spokesperson, it's Bane.The film then enters zeitgeist territory, with Bane's army tearing down Wall Street (or whatever the Gotham equivalent might be), nullifying the police presence, and staging the ultimate Occupy protest, while the meek Gotham citizens cower indoors. By this point serious questions about plot logic and group dynamics emerge - a lot of ""How did he end up there?"" and ""Why don't they just...?"" type enquiries. This is what happens when writers follow every digression their story allows.The Dark Knight Rises isn't a terrible film, but at nearly three hours the content must more compelling than this. I don't mind its neo- conservative messages; the worship of the feted elite is not new to the superhero canon. I can cope with the portentousness. Even Christian Bale's funny Batman voice doesn't bother me. These are all matters of taste. But if we're expected to take this stuff seriously then excessively exposition-heavy screen writing, narrative over-complexity in lieu of profundity, plot chasms, extraneous characterisation, and editorial indiscipline are inexcusable.Remove the cumbersome political overtones and you're left with something disappointingly generic: a doubtful hero (with attachment issues, of course) facing up to a brutish nemesis, a city in peril, and an explosive showdown. So you might as well watch Avengers Assemble again."
tt1853728,"I never wrote a review for any movie even if it was so good or so bad. But this one, I can't let it get away because of the most 2 wasted and upset hours in my whole life. I do not deny that, the first hour of the movie, I did enjoy because of the witty and funny and smart conversations, but the last 2 hours was becoming more and more unbearable. That's why I said 'just' TWO most wasted hours.I came to see it, with an expectation of a violent movie (as I was well aware by the name of the director)yet containing some humanity or at least some morale in it. Because come on, it won 2 Oscars and one of that is for best writing. But NO, I waited and waited until the end of the movie, and all I saw was just a man who ruthlessly kills people, no matter who they are, as long as they are white. And a man that just because of a woman, heartlessly stand outside watching other human get ripped off. I didn't even mention the loophole of logic throughout the movie.The music is ridiculous somewhere, it reminds me of some Chinese songs but on a cowboy-themed movie. Fair enough, 2 years before the civil war, we get rap and hip-hop in that too.I think it's fair enough for Christoph Waltz to win an Oscar for supporting role. He did a good job, and was a very major factor that brought me the first enjoyable hour. And then it just went from bad to worse. The whole film.I left after the ending with a big question in my head: How the hell does this film get an award for writing screen while all it's about is killing killing killing no matter what morale and reason? Or am I too naive or too shallow to understand any hidden humanity meaning in the film?"

Right away the suspicion of who killed Mr. Coletti and Jenny falls on Dr. Coletti. She had the most to gain by their death with her getting custody of her daughters and the Coletti estate, including the house, worth some two million dollars.Were put right on to who may have been the possible double murder on two former prison inmates whom Dr. Coletti dealt with Ciro Ruiz, Jon Huentas, and Ed Brinkman, Sean Patrick Flanery. The two not only were given parole because Dr. Coletti positive evaluation of them before the prison review board but because they both seemed to have become very infatuated with her. To the point of willing, like Ciro told her, to commit murder in her behalf. As for Lila's part she turns out to be secretly in love with the police detective that's been put on her husbands and his girlfriends murder case Det. Macy Kobacek, Michael Biehn.The movie leaves a number of baffling clues to both the police and audience that has to do with Lila's mental condition. Not just over her loss, to her husband Paul, of her two daughters but her own childhood where both she and her mom were abused by her deranged father. This childhood experience left Lila feeling that somehow he was killed by her or someone else in the family to put an end to their suffering. Ed Baikman whom we soon find out had the same kind of abusive childhood as Lila was put away for some twenty years after murdering both his parents. That's what seemed to have bonded him with Lila who was responsible for his overcoming his anger and inability to function in a free society.Being a suspect in Paul & Jenny's murder becomes more evident when the recently released convict Ciro Ruiz who was seen with Lila, who lied about it to the police, the night of the murders is found dead of an overdose from shooting himself up with drugs that come from the prison pharmacy. Only Lila had access to to the drugs that killed Ruiz! Arrested for murder and put behind bars Lila is in the same prison where she worked at as the prison psychiatrist.It's when Lila is arrested and put in prison when the movie gets really convoluted. First Lila isn't able to make bail, this for a double-murder?, and later is let out to find who really murdered Paul & Jenny! Were then lead to believe that their killer non-other then the weirdo Ed Baikman who seemed to worship the very ground that Lila walks on.Ed mad at Lila because she turned down his advances goes to another psychiatrist Dr. Karen Kendler, Louise Barnes. This causes Lila to storm into Dr. Kendler's office and let her know in no uncertain terms what a mad and dangerous person her new patient is thus having her drop Ed from treatment.The movie goes to it's totally unbelievable and mind twisting conclusion with Lila and Ed's unusual connection to Paul and Jenny's murders that takes us, the audience, into this never never land of madness and insanity. We have Lila's confused and by now flabbergasted boyfriend Det. Kobecek , who suddenly and unexpectedly pops up out of nowhere, only get it in the neck as Lila & Ed have it out with each other. This gives you the impression that both of them must have been cut with the same cookie cutter, out of the same dough, in how crazy and off-the-wall they both act.The ending****MAJOR SPOILERS**** is a real shocker, if you can somehow figure it out. Lila & Ed, had this whole scenario planned right from the start and sucked the love-sick and clueless Det. Kobecek into it making him the fall guy to take the blame, posthumously, for the twin murders! Were also lead to believe that their, Lila & Ed, in some way also related in a photo that we see as the movie draws to a close."
tt0068646,"The movie was based on a very bad book with a horrible language and style. It's no secret that the movie is better than the book, but it doesn't make it good.The story that turns violent ruthless criminals into men of honor and the horrible world of crime into something beautiful and almost royal.It's unnecessarily violent and why did Brando put paper towel in his mouth? I mean I like him as an actor, but this character is absolutely ridiculous.I don't understand how anyone could give an Oscar for that film! It's just stupid!"
tt1853728,"Okay, okay, of course, at first, me too, I thought that this was going to be a movie where Schultz and Django set out to find the three brothers that they go huntin' at the beginning, but no, within ten minutes they find them and that's that, so, soon I find out that the real plot is to get Brunhilde back, and to make this movie a flick that the adjective artsy-fartsy is worthy of bestowing upon, Brunhilde is of course an allusion to the great German myth, but let's face it, a gossamer-thin plot like this doesn't deserve to run on for what seems an endless three hours of shootouts, shootouts and more shootouts, and as for for Schultz, it must have been a real cinch for Waltz to play this character because he is more than just reminiscent of the character he played in Inglorieus Basterds, it's more like THE EXACT SAME ROLE, just take away the clothes and you've got Hans Landa, okay, he is less evil and weird, but the sophisticated language had me thinking, Can Waltz do more than just learn elaborate monologues filled with words nobody uses in everyday language by heart and recite them as he wishes, boooring, boring, could we please have the old Tarantino back, where dialogs were actually witty and humorous (Pulp Fiction) and were violence was still gratuitous but at least lent itself well to the characters that were shown, come on, this flick doesn't deserve the praise that it gets, it's more like Tarantino is developing into this one-trick pony and because of pure idolatry you don't want to see that Tarantino has done his contribution to cinema and won't create anything new."
tt1345836,"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a mainstream accomplishment, a skillfully crafted, ambitious superhero movie that adds more dimension to the superhero genre. Here is the epic (2 and 3/4 hours!) conclusion to a most beloved trilogy that forever changed the genre that it was type-casted in.I really have to admire Christian Bale's dedication to the role. At times he is weak, lacking confidence, and shrouded in gloom. At other times (in later scenes involving a prison) his eyes show the painful return to his self-determination and perseverance. Yes his Batman no doubt is still the best interpretation of the character, but here he is more human, less growly and more prone to weakness than ever before. Here, we first see Bruce Wayne as a single, rich hermit with a limp in one leg, aided only by his loyal butler Alfred (Michael Caine in his most emotional performance of the trilogy). Caine may get a supporting actor nomination for this movie.It's been eight years since he took the rep for Harvey Dent's crimes - but Wayne/Batman soon faces a new threat - the towering, ominous terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy in a remarkably gripping performance and an empowering presence) who threatens to destroy Gotham city. Hardy is ruthlessly terrific as Bane, true to the spirit of the comics, as he manages to instill fear in all of Gotham. It would be unfair to compare him to Heath Ledger's pitch perfect portrayal of the Joker, but these are two completely different characters. Whereas the Joker aims for a battle of psychological wits between Batman, Bane aspires just to destroy Bruce Wayne and Gotham.There is a pervasive sense of haunting dread and gloom throughout the movie, especially throughout the first 2 hours and scenes with Bane, this is achieved not just by Nolan's writing/directing but also to cinematographer Wally Pfister who shoots the film in a gloomy hue throughout, and composer Hans Zimmer's great, dark orchestral score. Zimmer probably has outdone himself in the trilogy so far, especially with Bane's ominous one-chord theme.But the last 30 minutes contains nothing but great, sometimes spectacular action sequences and stunts which segues in with the story (a rarity) and which all leads to an emotionally satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. The stunts are so well done, they clearly show they were all done using practical effects instead of CGI (with the probable exception of the stadium scene and scenes involving ""the Bat"" and the ""Bat-cycle""... which still look great). Lee Smith's crisp editing and Pfister's cinematography cuts the action at a perfect clip while making the somber moments absorbing.Two love interests are introduced - Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway, looking mesmerizingly beautiful while giving a devilishly cunning performance), a specialized thief/con-woman who is not what she seems, and Miranda Tate (Marion Cottilard) who provides a more gentler shade for the lonely, love-lorn Bruce to rely on, or does he? Young cop John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) serves as a somewhat younger shadow of Bruce, and he also shows the same selfless courage at the climax of the movie where he tries to save some kids from an orphanage. Scenes involving Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) are not particularly notable, but at the very least every one of these characters are still very active in the film's climax.Its the screen writing which suffers slightly. While clearly ambitious and detailed, the screenplay lacks some depth from which the previous film succeeded, and seems to return to the roots of ""Batman Begins"", focusing more on comic book origins - combining with the sombre, ultra- realistic tone of ""The Dark Knight"". For the most part, it gels nicely. There's also some nice character development for Bruce and Alfred, where they're relationship gets strained to the fullest. Some twists at the end that would arouse comic-book fans too. However, Bane's full character should have been expanded upon - yes, even though the film is nearly 3 hours long, it's not really long enough. Bane's and Selina's characters lack in development and they come across as near-two dimensional. It's clear Nolan bit off a bit more than he can chew here, since he was trying his best to outdo his previous effort. No faulting the actors though.For all of its screen writing flaws though, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a mainstream triumph, putting new levels of fear and dread in a superhero movie not seen before its own predecessor. Nolan's vision for the character shines through completely and makes this trilogy rightfully stand out as ""The Godfather"" of superhero films. This entry may not be as brilliant as its predecessor, but it is still nevertheless great, sort of excellent really, and hats off to Nolan, Bale, Hardy and the rest of the cast and crew, past and present, for delivering the truest interpretation of the Batman character that has never been, and very likely in the future, never will be seen again. Kudos to you, Christopher Nolan.Overall rating: 86%P.S.: My review for ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) four years ago is basically a teenage me kissing the behind of the film, with me calling it a masterpiece and editing the review on IMDb so much until they won't allow me to edit/review it anymore. Looking back, I probably shouldn't have been so enthusiastic and made myself look like a rabid fanboy; it isn't a masterpiece, but nonetheless still an excellent film and the pinnacle of the superhero film genre.EDIT: My sincere condolences to the victims and their family and friends of the Aurora shooting tragedy. This was a real random, cruel and senseless act of violence."
tt7286456,"Arthur Fleck's a guy with lofty aspirations, wants to make you laugh and disturb your foundations, although, he's not really that funny, he ain't going to make much money, so before you start, curtail your expectations; unlike Arthur, you won't be having laughing fits, as he aspires to get some television glitz, dispatches tormentors with glee, it's a substantial, hefty fee, but I guarantee, it won't leave you in bits; although, if schadenfreude's your thing you might just chuckle, but if it's not, the story may just make you buckle, as those on, the lower rungs, tend to not have, that much fun, and quite often, from the day they learned to suckle."
tt0120737,"Due to popular demand, some of the reasons why Lord of the Rings is a poor film :This movie is so stifled by nonsense and Hollywood tricks that it's hard to discern, beneath it, the work of a purportedly intelligent, talented, and celebrated author beneath it.To begin with: there are way too many closeups in this movie. Why couldn't Peter Jackson simply let us stand back and watch the characters behave? Why does the camera have to keep poking into the characters' faces, looking for subtle clues? Maybe Jackson's been spending too much time watching the moronic trash of Spielberg, the most overrated director of all time who still hasn't learned how to let go of the audience's hand.The melodramatic soundtrack, far from sustaining or assisting the story, cheapens it and, as Spielberg is so adept at doing, leads me to believe that the intended audience is probably those people who don't like to think too hard. This film would've been far improved if Jackson had simply left out the lousy soundtrack.The special effects generally do not add anything to the story.And there is plenty of plain illogical nonsense in here. For one example, i think we can all agree that it's physically impossible for a human being to outrun an absolutely normal, healthy horse. If a person is being followed at full gallop by a horse, the horse will always catch up. Also, i always have trouble swallowing scenes wherein one or two people capably defeat an army of assailants counting ten, twenty, or more, unless these one or two heroes or heroines happen to have superhuman traits or at least an extraordinarily exceptional degree of training. I'm not aware of whether or not this sort of occurrence is consistent with the actual text, but as i watch the film, i can't help feeling lost in all of Jackson's nonsense.And so much swooping! Why so much swooping? More Spielberg influence. I admit there's also swooping in Heavenly Creatures, but by now his swooping has become quite distracting. Why can't we just watch the characters? Isn't Jackson supposed to be telling us a story?I like Jackson's earlier films, and Heavenly Creatures is a brilliant and compelling one, and clearly his best. But now he's off remaking King Kong... maybe he's gotten lost in Hollywood. Someone please help him find his way out!Peter Jackson had the potential of making a great film which could've lasted many decades as a classic, but instead he made a sloppy moneymaker. What a loss.But then again, perhaps this movie was made for children.On the plus side, the pretty New Zealand landscapes are nice to look at."
tt1853728,"Interesting plot, story and events. Above average soundtrack and good actors who are really amiable and suitable. Excellent photography and directing of the movie. Holds excellent messages though many things need to be clearer. Just enough comedy to be mixed with drama. Sequence of events is good to very good but could've been much better. The movie was very good and had just the perfect amount of western style inclusion but for most people I think they expected more in addition to the amount of drama. The movie showed how crucial the slavery of black people was but didn't show how crucial it was for the other blacks (other than him and his wife and couple of others) and this was very disappointing taking into consideration how long the movie was. I think the movie should've been also count as a drama and an action. Overall, the movie was very good and fun to watch and sophisticated in a way, plus it was just enough western and drama that will not make you depressed.

tt0468569,"1) A general comment...This movie typifies why I would like to see IMDb have a system that deletes user ratings every year for ten years after a movie is released (maybe keep the last years ratings and delete the years before that one's user ratings until ten years is up, if you catch my drift). If ""Twister"" 1996 came out now a days there would be 300k people voting in 3 days and giving it an 8.6 rating (still to high at 6.0, but the movie wasn't very old when IMDb started up).2) Review...I couldn't finish watching ""The Dark Knight"". I tried earlier this year and then again the other night. It was horrible..... Let's start with the actors shall we...Ken dolls trying to act; a ""cough-cough"" not very attractive leading lady; and, of course, the highly overrated, yet not all that terrible, performance from Heath Ledger. Let's face it, anyone who saw ""Batman"" 1989 could see the rip off with Ledger's Joker. Michael Caine as Alfred???? Could you take him seriously as Alfred after seeing him in Austin Powers. The Chinese bad guy was the best actor in the movie...Are you starting to understand how bad this is yet?!I just can't go into how poor the story elements are too much. I'll get a migraine. Example: The prosecutor punches the witness and then takes a gun off someone, pulls it apart and then leaves it in front of the defendant. No, I didn't oversimplify it. I didn't leave something out. It's really that stupid. The rest of the movie (at least as far as I got) is also that bad. I think that's all I need to say. There's just no point in going on. I'll just add the one positive aspect...The effects are top notch.3) Summary...Money, hype, dead actor hype, special effects, blah blah blah. You know the drill. You only get one pair of eyes, so take care of them. Stay away!!!"
tt0422272,"Surfin through, trying to find a good scary movie. I came across this one. I literally went to this app, read the reviews and decided to give it a chance, BOY! Was it worth it! This movie kept me on the edge of my seat! Very well done."
tt0114369,"Now I'm no hater of violence in films and I rather enjoy a good horror.The two leads are both actors I usually enjoy and they both give good performances is this.The film making and camera work in this film are very, very good.It's well acted and I think the director and script writers got the film they wanted.So what is the reason I have scored this a ""2""?Well it's ""torture porn"", it may even be the first of the current seemingly never ending proliferation of titles and I just can't see the attraction on on-ending suffering and pain as the subject of a film. The only reason for such films seems to me to show increasingly nasty ways of maiming and killing people. If that kind of film is what you enjoy then watch this as it is certainly better made and acted than most of the genre, but it's not for me."
tt0167261,"Here are my point by point thoughts on Two Towers.--Right from the start, this film opens with a sequence more cartoonish than anything in Fellowship. It later provides a shoddy rationalization to bring Gandalf back from the dead. I feel that this trivializes his death in Fellowship, which was one of the more effectively dramatic moments in that film. I guess an apparent death results in one's return as a ""whiter"" version of oneself. Gandalf struts around like nothing happened. Also, when someone says that they were ""sent back"" from heaven ""until my task is completed"", I get the impression that they are borderline invincible. This diminishes any sense of danger in the storyline for this character, and also diminishes the theme of death in the film overall.--Another problem I have is with Gollum, who is annoying as soon as he appears. I suppose that's a personal gripe, but his mannerisms are rather obnoxious and hammy. He's practically unwatchable. His character is also a substandard attempt at writing a character with fake complexity. Gollum shifts between evil jerk and loyal nutcase. That's about it. One understands the character completely the moment his split personalities present themselves. Unfortunately, this shift in personality is repeatedly hammered into the viewer's brain. Yes, we got it the first time it was shown. Simply shifting between two thin personalities dozens of times does not create character depth or complexity. Also, was there ever a question that his evil jerk personality would ultimately emerge as the dominant one? At no point during these films did I think that he would choose NOT to steal the ring (even for a second), and I didn't even read the books. His inner conflict feels meaningless and superfluous to me.--The drab visuals make for some tedious viewing. Everything is gray. The environments are gray. The skies are gray. The bad guys are gray. Gollum is gray. The orcs are gray. The weapons are gray. The buildings are gray. The color scheme is way too monotonous and repetitive.--The stifling effects of the ring were already established by the end of Fellowship. We saw the effects of the ring on a variety of characters, so it's certainly frustrating that Two Towers continues to harp on this subject without further elaboration or complexity. Frodo, Sam, and Gollum basically just walk through gray environments for 3 hours while complaining about the ring's effects. We already spent 3 hours in Fellowship explaining this issue, and Two Towers brings nothing new to the table.--It's rarely mentioned, but this movie has one-dimensional, boring antagonists. We get very little time with any of them, and none of them are memorable. They're just generic caricatures to be ""fought against"" as necessary. There are standard bad guys that show up all over the place, like those big cartoon hyenas near the midpoint and the giant army near the end. A few memorable bad guys and some development would have made things a lot more engaging.--That leads us to the action, which has some uninspired choreography. The flaw of generic bad guys can be partially mitigated when the protagonists break out some awesome maneuvers or strategies. Very little of this appears in this movie. We mostly get basic sword swipes, arrow shots, and riding horses directly into swarms of baddies. You'd think that Helm's Deep would have some traps and attack strategies for whittling the enemy down as they approach the fortress, but such is not the case - thereby wasting an opportunity for some creative attacks. At one point it seemingly points to Aragorn and Gimli having some kind of plan, but Aragorn just throws Gimli into a swarm of hundreds of baddies. To be fair, there are a few good moments to be had near the end (e.g., the bomb, the giant ladders, etc.), but that's not saying much when one realizes that the battle lasts over 30 minutes.--The CGI is exposed more here than in Fellowship, with some particularly cartoonish moments (like the opening sequence, the big hyenas, etc.).--What is it, exactly, that the characters accomplish during the first two hours of this movie? Aragorn helps Gandalf cure a king, then he sits around and talks. It's also ironic that Gandalf is brought back from the dead, then given almost nothing to do. He spends much of the film off screen as he rides his horse to find reinforcements, a task that almost any other character could have completed. Meanwhile, the elves sit around and talk, mostly about stuff we already know. The humans sit around and talk, mostly about fighting but there's no discussion regarding battle strategy other than where they want to fight. They also walk around and put on armor. Merry and Pippin talk to a tree that takes forever to form sentences. I tell you, this movie is very difficult to sit through.--This movie also introduces one of the more unconvincing love triangles in cinematic history. Aragorn, Arwen, and that other chick. Why even bother having romance in this movie at all if you're not going to spend time on it, develop it, or make it important? Aragorn and Arwen have a brief discussion or two, then make-out. That's it. Also, Liv Tyler can't act.--One point that is related to Galdalf's contrived resurrection is this: there are various fake deaths of characters in this movie. Pippin and Aragorn are given ""possible deaths"", but the filmmakers (and/or original novelist) obviously don't want to kill off a main character. Of course, they do kill a random elf dude in an unwarranted moment of overdramatism. I'm not sure why I'm supposed to feel sorry for a guy that had a grand total of 30 seconds of screen time before his death.--Also, the wizardry in this film is not creative. There's not much in terms of spellcasting."
tt1345836,"In order that this review doesn't sound like it came from the Department of Redundancy Department, I will try not to cover the same ground as my predecessors in declaring that the Emperor has no clothes. Rather, I will try and discuss the little things that made this a big, bad film.Let me also say I am not a worshipper of Mr. Nolan, nor am I a staunch detractor of his. The Prestige is one of the best and most original films I have ever seen. I enjoyed Memento, and also Batman Begins.I was not a fan of Inception, and my feelings on The Dark Knight are mixed. I very much enjoyed Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, and the way the Joker's character was written. I thought the Joker's monologue in the hospital when he explained to Harvey Dent that the hokey pokey IS what it's all about was nothing short of brilliant.I did not come to The Dark Knight Rises ready to hate it, or love it. I watched the film, objectively, and I saw it a second time from a better seat in a different theater, just to make sure I wasn't being unfair.Nope.Sorry Mr. Nolan, sir.Your movie sucks.Why? Because, as the Joker might remind us, the Devil is in the details.Details, details, details, it is the little things that the mind notices. Some of us laugh and call ""BS"" when John Wayne gets eleven shots out of a six-shooter, but we believe it when Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis never have to reload, because they swear and they have dirt and blood on their costumes and faces.For example, the matter of Bruce Wayne's fingerprints.Mr. Wayne is not only Batman, he is also a billionaire businessman. Surely, he would be a bit more, oh, perturbed that his fingerprints have been stolen. Let's be serious. If you found out that your fingerprints, or something else intimately connected to you, like your SSN or your signature had been stolen, wouldn't you be thinking about the possibility of identity theft? Wouldn't you be in a cold sweat that someone was going to use those fingerprints to perform a total cashectomy on you? Well, Bruce Wayne isn't. He's pretty cavalier about the whole thing. Ah, well, so somebody wants to steal my identity. Or my money. It's not like I'm a billionaire or I have a secret identity or anything.Wait.ALFRED! Ah, yes, but Alfred's not coming, Master Bruce. You see, he's so worried about you being completely unhinged, and unready to get back in the Bat-tights, and the possibility that you might be killed that he's just going to take it on his toes and leave you to your own devices when you're at your weakest point and you need him the most.Hurm.And then we have the matter of Miranda/Talia. Here I am thinking Tony Stark's the superhero who'll screw just about any interesting chick who's willing and available, but, well, Bruce has been having a bad month, we'll cut him some slack.Except Tony has staff members who do background checks on his playmates, and staff who dismiss them when he's through playing.With a few bucks and a non-disclosure statement, most likely.You would think that before Bruce Wayne wagered HALF his assets on a business partnership with Miranda, he would have used his state-of-the-art, info-the-KGB-CIA-MI5-doesn't have supercomputer to do a thorough background check.He is the goddamn Batman, after all.Well, he didn't. Not did he do any research on her before they got involved, kind of out of the clear blue sky.But he didn't find her sudden romantic interest fishy, and hey, she seemed like a nice girl, why not pass up Alfred, or Lucius Fox and just let her have the whole shebang.And then, after we discover How Bruce Got His Groove Back, he decides to buy some pastel shirts and abscond to the continent, leaving Gotham, and the Batman legacy in the hands of some cop named Robin (groan) with another very nice girl who has shown him that she's a liar and a thief who probably doesn't have his best interests at heart.Here's to you, Alfred. Sorry you're broke. Good luck with all those orphans and none of my money, relying on the city to keep you funded.Burn the furniture in the rooms you're not using for heat if they cut you off for a few years. Get the boys some paper routes.Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go return some videotapes.Hurm, I say again, because this person doesn't sound like any Bruce Wayne I've ever encountered, in any of his many incarnations.I mean, Adam West was a lot more on the ball in the old TV show. And if this is Bruce Wayne as an, ahem, realistic character? Realistically, this self-pitying, egocentric, blundering half-wit wouldn't have ever made it out of that Asian prison in the first movie.Riddle me this? When is Bruce Wayne not Batman? In this film. Because there is no Devil in these details, indeed, if you are looking for The Dark Knight in Bruce Wayne as portrayed in this film, there is no-one there at all."

tt0816692,"Look this is still a good film and my rating system has no actual weight here. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant film maker but lately you start noticing that he is not without his shortcomings.His films are laden with the same tropes especially the massive plot holes. And that was the reason I wanted to see this film, to see what plot hole he had this time and yes they are a plenty.I will still give credit to where it's due. He really wanted to make a head scratcher and this time with the laws of general relativity which the film does closely follow. Basically the emotional device here is that Matthew Mahogany traveling at a fraction of the speed of light through space makes him age slower than his kids and basically its a race against time.However the Nolan-isms come full circle with not-so-subtle foreshadowing, overly pretentious unnatural dialogue, heavy-handed symbolism, a really ear-ringing Hans Zimmer score which make the Inception horns sound like and an unnecessarily long run time.I can see that this is a script he didn't really have time to think through but you can see he tried and its still pretty entertaining. However it's no 2001 A Space Odyssey. He should stick to thrillers. Sorry."
tt0120737,"I'd first like to state that I've been a fan of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy since 1978 when I first read the series. I've since re-read it an estimated 30 times because of the story's essence and the uniqueness and relationship of its characters. Unfortunately, this was lost with the making of this movie. Somehow, the writer(s) and director(s) missed the boat entirely. Where the movie went wrong: 1) Frodo keeps offering/showing the ring to everyone he meets, 2) Merry and Pippin are immature idiots, 3) Arwen saves Frodo??  4) lame ""stair-collapsing"" scene that eats time, 5) lame ""Wringwraith chasing Arwen on horses"" scene also eats time, 6) lame orcs (climbing down from the ceiling??), 7) lame Elrond, Gimli, and elves, to name just a few. Good points of the movie: Digital movie graphics, excellent Balrog (unfortunately scene too short), and Legolas character.I have littel doubt the Tolkien clan would agree that the true nature of the characters and their quest has been poorly portrayed. Granted, the movie can't be exactly like the book, however, the story is what makes ""Lord of the Rings"" a classic and, again, they completed missed it in this movie. I hope the second and third movies improve, but I wouldn't be surprised if Arwen ends up slaying all the fowl beasts that Frodo encounters. Perhaps I'll live long enough to see the remaking of the movie(s) that show the characters experiencing their quest(s) as J.R.R. Tolkien presented them in his books. P.S. Recommendation for the Director:  At the battle of Minas Tirith when the Riders of Rohan enter the scene, show it in slow motion while playing Led Zepplin's ""Battle of Evermore."" If so, I might have a more positive comment about this effort."

tt0102926,"Ever since I was a little kid, I was obsessed with reading pulp horror. I've read more from the genre than anyone I personally know. Being a soon-to-be-published author myself, I've learned more about the genre by constantly reading than by any writing seminar I've ever been to. For those who don't read, by simple definition, pulp horror is: a story that is genuinely terrifying and thrilling, but purposely lacks any forced literary moral. Stephen King is pretty much the poster-child of this style of writing. With all of that said, when The Silence of the Lambs, the novel, was released and received mass critical acclaim for being the ""perfect"" horror-thriller, even being the major genre-whore that I am, I could really care less. Why? Simple because I'd read so many books EXACTLY like it, I had no interest. A few years later, when the movie was released, I felt the exact same way. This is why I've waited so long to view this ""impossible-to-miss!"" film. Because I knew it was just more of the same. When I finally decided to force myself to watch it, I found my gut instinct was underestimating. The Silence of the Lambs is not only just more of the same unoriginal story that we've all heard so many times that it's second nature to us, it's also cheesy, immature, over-glamorized, and, in the end, completely laughable. And here is why . . .First and foremost: The Silence of the Lambs is, unarguably, 100% unoriginal. There is not a single original‚Äîor even creative‚Äîconcept in the entire runtime of the film. This paragraph of my review is not my opinion. The way I view the world has no bearing on what has or hasn't been done in storytelling before. Saying that it's my opinion that The Silence of the Lambs is unoriginal is equivalent to saying that it's my opinion that the sky is blue. And just as childish. With that said, I can literally point you, scene-by-scene, to where every single idea in The Silence of the Lambs has been written and filmed in the past. Dressed to Kill, for a major example. From the formula, to the characters, to the situations, to the set-up: it's all, unarguably, one giant genre clich√©. And, as I said, I can point to every movie, every book that has used the EXACT scenes in the past. This isn't just a coincidence; it's an unabashed lack of creativity and intelligence from the writer. Just more of the same clich√© Hollywood and pulp fiction conventions we've seen all our lives. All the standard clich√©s are here, folks: romantic subplot, tension at the agency, troubled childhoods, etc., etc., etc.Hannibal Lector himself is, admittedly by the author, nothing but a mash-up of various fictional and real-life serial killers. The two most obvious fictional killers he unabashedly rips-off are Leatherface (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, 1974) and Mark Lewis (Peeping Tom, 1960). Leatherface's actions (cannibal, wears victim's faces) + Lewis's mind (pretentious, psychiatrist, study's human behavior, kills people to study reactions, gives long speeches about serial killers, has a supposed vast knowledge of the human mind) = Hannibal Lector. There is not a single character trait that Lector has that wasn't done nearly 40 years before he was written. Again, a kindergarten lack of creativity. I honestly don't even know how his character got past copyright laws.Not to mention Hannibal's cheesy persona. He pronounces ""liver"" with slurping sounds at the end. So did 3-year-olds, but I don't cower in fear of them. He never actually DOES anything on-screen, except talk. And talk. And when he does talk, he talks with the pseudo-intelligence of a high-school dropout who took a semester of psychology. Why? Because his psychological knowledge is laughably limited, and sometimes incorrect all together. He's supposed to be this oh-so-evil genius, but all he ever does is quote clich√© phrases from dumbed-down Freud. He knows NOTHING about psychology. The pathetic writers just wrote enough clich√© psychobabble between his laugh-out-loud cheesy slurping sounds to make it seem like he knew at least as much about the human mind as the average middle-school student. And then, just like all over-glamorized Hollywood, every time Hannibal is on the screen they point the camera up at his face with light shining behind his head as he stares at the ceiling without blinking. That's not good acting. That's made-for-TV directing they use in low-budget Jesus movies. Hannibal Lector is nothing but an awkward middle-aged man who is obsessed with talking and breaking copyright laws. How is that unnerving? If I met him, I'd laugh in his face and tell him to grow up.So, at root value, I'm just trying to ask: What is so great about this movie? It's a generic crime thriller. It opens up with a generic cop-meets-killer scene, and ends with a generic cheesy-killer-in-the-house scene. Everything in between is exactly what you'd expect from an over-glamorized generic Hollywood thriller. It has NO significance whatsoever when it comes to originality. And as far as entertainment value goes, I don't see what's so entertaining in watching a middle-age man talk for an hour on end. If that entertains you, I pity you.Oh my God! This movie TERRIFIED me! Why? Because an awkward middle-aged man pronounced ""liver"" like a 3-year-old.I'll say the same thing to those of you who gave this movie a high score as I'd say to Hannibal Lector: GROW UP.2/10"
tt0108052,"Schindler's List is an awful movie: unstintingly sentimental and heavy-handedly manipulative. The only reason it's so loved is because of the subject matter. As presented in the book, Oskar Schindler was a complicated, not entirely admirable man. Too complex, in other words, to be the central character in one of Steven Spielberg's simple-minded morality tales. Practically the only good thing in it (apart from its intentions) is the acting."
tt1130884,One of the best movies of the century! Loved every little plot twist!
tt1375666,"I had the privilege of seeing this movie before it came out, and, like most of DiCaprio's films, it blew me away.Inception is a well-made movie, filmed in about 6 locations all over the world. The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult).The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It's great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you're thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show, it is worth every penny you pay.Truly unique, like nothing i've ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn't afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending."
tt1345836,"i cant believe that some people are giving 10 rating for this pretentious,boring film.some are blinded by the hype and mass hysteria.even though they feel the movie boring,they are not willing to accept it.the guy who sat beside us in the theatre fell asleep halfway through the film and after the completion of film,he woke up and clapped.lol.all they want is part of batman patron and feel cool about it.coming to the film,its a rip-off of Bond film 'The World is not Enough'. In both films, the innocent woman is ultimately revealed to be the true mastermind/villain and the ""monstrous villain"" works for her out of devotion. Both are also willing to sacrifice themselves for love. Not to mention Bane was very much like Renard (villain from TWINE): a single named, intelligent anarchist terrorist with super strength due to a disorder, and we are led to believe throughout the bulk of both films that Bane and Renard are the masterminds behind the plot. Then there's Miranda Tate and Elektra King; beautiful,foreign businesswomen who deal in global energy.Both earn the trust of the hero (Bond/Wayne) while becoming romantically involved with them, though it's all a part of their plan to use the hero's company (MI6 and Wayne Enterprises) to her own ends. The plans are basically the same as well: steal reactor- nuclear material with the goal of nuking an entire city (Gotham and Istanbul). Another leading lady who is foxy at first and helps the hero later.character Q - Lucius fox with gadgets,M - alfred.Just added the holy drama stuff like depressed,burdened,not so-heroic Batman and hope for the city blah..blah.the icy post-apocalyptic,anarchy episodes are boring.there are many plot-holes and logicless scenes like taking a big city as hostage for months"

tt0114369,"Brad Pitt is not likable, completely uninteresting. Want him to die as quickly as possible so Morgan Freeman can get more screen time. Saw the ending coming miles away. And then the film just dragged along at 10 mph wanting to involve me in a drama about Pitts characters final decision regarding whet ever to kill in anger or control himself. Oh-ho! Guess what happens!This movie should have been done from the serial killers pov - with him as the hero and Freeman as the real anti-hero. And a different actor than Pitt- Has he ever played something that goes beyond 2D?It is a pseudo-artsy film with no real depth. A postulate. A mental exercise without any real drama. Bad script and bad script directing. Fincher don't know how to tell his story. He only got it right in Fight Club."
tt0372784,"Hit director, Christopher Nolan, brings us another action packed picture filled with special effects. Amazing actors enhance the action within the frames as feelings never felt before are released as you are pulled into the action. All the film needs now is an audience to surround with wonder.The Storyline twists and confuses but also captures and enchants as you follow the life of Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) and how the tragic death of his parents, affects his opinion on Gotham City. He realises though his experiences how he can make this town a better place. Until his only friend becomes his only enemy, and he feels like the whole world is against him.Gotham City is like no other; with crime ridden streets and dark alleyways, (put there with an intention) it's the perfect setting for Batman's home town. Underground caves surround the grounds of Wayne Towers (Bruce's Fathers business) so secret plans can be laid down to save the city. In these chamber-like rooms with miles a space scientific projects have been stored- never to see the light of day again. Or will they? Michael Cane plays a naturally calm and convincing Alfred. The butler, who serves the Wayne family, adds humour with witty one-liners and a down to earth character, which brings the whole picture into reality. His soft nature is what keeps Bruce from doing what he shouldn't.Christian Bale is extremely talented actor with the skill to comfortably present his character to the audience. Watch his change in character when he is in different situations. This is how the secret of his identity is kept.Heart pacing music creates an astonishing atmosphere to match the high detail and quick moving scenes. Blink and you're bound to miss something! Emotions run riot as you follow with your ears, the intense mood changes and roller coaster story. The clever changes in music tell you what's going to happen before you see it. There is a surprise round every street corner, so be careful you go.Using crystal clear camera tricks and long fast shots, Batman begins is shown in all its glory. Nolan has cleverly followed all the flight, agility and sweeping actions the creature's movement and has captured it on a screen. Quick cuts emphasis the speed of the film and how the story happens in such a small section of history.Overall the techniques used in the film bring it to life and generates a feeling that you are really there, in the one and only Gotham City. Actors' maximise the other features to bring the feature up to and outstanding quality. So much is packed into 134 minutes; every second is worth the attention. You'll be crazy to miss the film of year and probably the film of the decade!"
tt0110912,"Perhaps before I start talking about why I think Pulp Fiction works on so many levels, I should mention briefly how I came to watch the film. Pulp Fiction was a film I had heard of at a very young age, and I'm not quite sure why. I had also wanted to see it for a very long time- again, I'm not quite sure why. Maybe the mere fact that it was R-rated and notorious for its violence perked the interest of my 14-year-old self. Nevertheless, I got round to watching it about a month before my 15th birthday- incredibly late at night on an occasion where I found myself home alone. I recall being blown away by the film, but also somewhat overwhelmed and confused. I had never seen anything like it before, and walked away from it being kinda sure I'd enjoyed it. I couldn't say for sure though.Still feeling curious about the film, and the many mysteries relating to it that I'd failed to determine on my first viewing, I re-watched the film just a couple of months later. And something just clicked for me- I fell in love with the film. Everything about the movie suddenly worked for me, and I found the second viewing to be perhaps the shortest two and a half hours of my life I've ever experienced. My own sense of time was warped and bended to the extent that it was in the film itself. That very night it somehow became one of the greatest things I had ever watched; one of the only films I'd seen that I barely hesitated to call a masterpiece.Since then I've watched it another six or seven times- almost once a year- and I continue to feel motivated to watch it because I honestly feel like I get something new out of it each time I watch it.Spoilers ahead, by the way. I plan to get fairly in-depth with my review of this movie, so just a warning for those that haven't seen it.One of the great things about Pulp Fiction is its refusal to fall under any particular genre or category of movies. It feels like a comedy when Jules and Vince discuss fast food and foot massages for nearly ten minutes It feels like a thriller during several segments, notably the scene where Mia overdoses on heroin and the climactic Mexican stand-off in the restaurant- two sequences that would have even Alfred Hitchcock on the edge of his seat. The crime genre is represented through the character's actions- most of the cast are criminals in one way or another, whether they murder, steal, or take generous helpings of class-A drugs. The infamous gimp scene feels straight out of a horror movie.This collage of various movie genres is one of the things that makes the movie stand out- by themselves, certain scenes may feel familiar, but when they're all blended together so well like they are in Pulp Fiction, the end product ends up feeling unique. This is true for most of Quentin Tarantino's films- he borrows elements from different genres, and homages/ references dozens of older movies in order to create something that feels unique, even if most of the individual elements themselves aren't too original. I can see why some people may not be a fan of the fact Tarantino essentially steals from the lesser known works of those who came before him, but for me, I love it- I think he just makes it work due to the fact that his encyclopaedic knowledge of film allows him to borrow from so many sources. If he simply referenced about a half dozen or less films for each one of his movies, then I think that would start to feel like plagiarism.Now, I could go on about the acting, the screenplay, the direction, and the glorious soundtrack, but really, what's there to say about these elements of the film that haven't already been said? Tarantino's screenplay is one of the most acclaimed and quoted from the past couple of decades, and deservedly won him his first Oscar. His direction has been similarly praised, and the soundtrack has become iconic- most impressive of all is that Tarantino chose music that goes so well with the images they accompany. And yes, the acting is phenomenal- the film features what is almost certainly Samuel L. Jackson's best performance, one of Bruce Willis' most interesting performances of his long and successful career, and some great work from Uma Thurman. Even the supporting actors are memorable, including Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace (who's arguably the film's main character- think about it; without him, none of the three main stories would exist- Butch ripped off Marsellus Wallace, Vince took out Wallace's girlfriend on a date that eventually went horribly wrong, and Vince and Jules were assigned to retrieve the mysterious briefcase for Wallace). And of course, who can forget that Pulp Fiction single-handedly made John Travolta cool again- an absolutely monumental achievement. Of course Travolta did eventually succeed in making himself a joke again a few years later when he made Battlefield Earth, but that's another story (or perhaps better left for another review)?As I said, I could indulge in commenting on these areas of the film, but if you've seen the movie you probably already know how good they are. Pulp Fiction is also one of the most discussed film's of the past 20 years, so you've likely already come across reviews or rabid Tarantino fans who've gushed about why the film works so well, and how fantastic all the various components of the film are.So instead, I'm going to backtrack back to my point about seeing something new in the film upon every new viewing, and explain what I took away from the movie on my most recent viewing.Pulp Fiction was always controversial for its violence, with some criticising its depiction of assaults, shootings, beatings, and exploding heads. But for me, I found the film to have an almost anti-violence message of sorts, and I only realised this on my most recent viewing. Now bear with me, because I know that sounds like a somewhat ridiculous claim, but I have my reasons. Pulp Fiction may be violent, but it doesn't promote violence. Sure, the violence may be somewhat stylised and at times over the top, but that doesn't mean the film is saying that violence is something trivial. Violent acts in the film are often shown to have consequences for those that commit them. Vince's carelessness with his gun- an instrument of violence- causes Marvin's head to be blown off in the backseat of Jules' car, which leads to a near twenty minute detour in which they must take the car to Jimmy's house and consult ""The Wolf"" to assist them in cleaning the car and disposing of the gory evidence. Marsellus' desire to get revenge on Butch by presumably killing him leads them both to the basement of the rednecks- indeed, they are both fighting each other in the redneck's store when they are taken captive.But in the climax of the film, where guns are being pointed at several characters in the middle of a tense Mexican stand-off, not a single bullet is fired. One would expect the tension to be eventually broken and the bullets to start flying, especially if one has seen some of Taratino's other movies that end in explosive and violent climaxes (see Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds, Death Proof, Django Unchained, and Kill Bill Volume 1). But instead, Jules, who we've seen to be ruthless and unafraid to kill earlier in the movie, believes himself to be a changed man after miraculously surviving a hail-storm of bullets from a criminal that looks a little like Jerry Seinfeld and so instead decides to defuse the situation peacefully. He talks down Pumpkin and Honey-Bunny from killing or robbing anyone, and insists that his dim-witted associate Vince refrain from hurting anyone too. He delivers an absolutely stunning monologue where he ponders the bible reading he quoted so confidently earlier in the movie, and it's damn-near poetic. It sends a shiver up my spine every time I watch that scene, and indeed, Jules' speech works. The two robbers get up after Jules gives them some money from his famous wallet, and then leave. Jules and Vince do the same a few moments later.Not a shot is fired. No one is killed. It's an absolutely beautiful scene.It may have been tempting for Tarantino to give the film a ""Wild Bunch-esque"" ending, but instead he refrained, and I'm glad he did so. The climax to Pulp Fiction is absolutely stunning- fifteen minutes of tension, almost poetic dialogue, and brilliant acting, especially from Samuel L. Jackson. And it took me seven viewings just to notice how beautifully peaceful the ending of the film was. And that's why it's my favourite film of all time- I get new meaning from it, or appreciate different areas of it every-time I watch it.If you've never seen Pulp Fiction before, I implore you to go watch it.
And if you have seen Pulp Fiction before, I implore you to go watch it again."
tt1375666,"All that stuff about sharing dreams makes zero scientific or philosophical sense. And no-one can have dreams with that amount of detail, that many actors, that much lightning fast action, etc, etc. Read Daniel Dennett.There were plenty of stunning special effects and stunts certainly, but I had the feeling throughout that the plot was just a peg to hang these on. If you want to see how to do dreams in cinema, look elsewhere, for example the dream sequence in Wild Strawberries, the Soldier's dreams in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, the whole of Un Chien Andalou. Even Buster Keaton did better than this in Sherlock Junior 80-odd years ago.If you're going to make a film about dreaming, first figure out how to film dreams."

tt0848228,"This movie is the definition of being over-hyped: Hardly any aspect of it has escaped being hailed as among the best of recent years, be it acting, special effects, fighting scenes or plot. In my opinion, it falls far, far short of that benchmark. The visual effects are very good, sure, but then so are the effects in Battleship.The acting isn't bad, but it's hardly impressive either. The few impressive performances are completely overshadowed by the very average writing. Platitudes, one-liners, soundbites and trailer lines are constant. Much of it makes no sense at all: Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is cautious about ""the other one"" and seems to dislike people knowing about it, yet he constantly references this. It's as if the writers thought ""We haven't shown Banner as the Hulk yet; better make him allude to that in his every line so people don't forget.""The largest problem with the movie, without a doubt, is the plot. The bad guy never feels threatening, his plan is extremely inefficient and frankly stupid in many ways, and the plot holes are too many to count. For instance, in one scene we see the Hulk being a mindless beast, destroying everything in his path, but later we see him taking orders. Add to that that the superhero who apparently has the power of super-aim misses whenever the script calls for it making his on-screen superpower ""is really good with a bow and arrow"". In one scene he misses half a dozen shots from a distance of 12 feet.On a related note, what is Captain Americas superpower compared to the others? Patriotism? Other Avengers are superiour in every single way. Ranged combat, close combat, mobility, intelligence, strength... Even his weapon is a worse version of Thors hammer. Not that Black Widow is any better, but at least she has some use in the plot.This movie is like The Expendables, only it takes itself seriously and has better acting. It is thoroughly unimpressive and how it currently has a rank of #57 of all time movies is truly baffling."
tt0468569,"Well I wanted a Frank Miller style movie and I got one. Just got back from the Montpelier VT hosted premiere, presented by Senator Leahy and WB CEO Barry Meyer....Heath's haunting portrayal as the Joker was captivating; this is the wild, anarchist, and truly disturbed loon we've been waiting for. I'm glad they kept any concrete origin out and instead opted for explaining Joker's existence as a necessity to Gotham's order and control. From the Killing Joke' ""Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"" He wails on Bats in one scene with cane and knife, using the strength of a madman, contrasting sharply with Batman showing restraint just when you really think he might lose it.The development of Two-Face played out well, showing his transition from strong public leader Dent to the duality driven, obsessive Two-Face, raging against free will. I'm proud to report he didn't rob the 2nd Gotham Bank at 2pm on the 2nd of February.Batman/Bruce give us what we expect from where Batman Begins leaves him; as a very very busy vigilante. It is nice how little change he goes through as Bruce, against how detached he must become, and how far he must fall as the Batman.Other than that, cool gadgetry from Wayne R&D of course, almost all of it believable. Sonic suit, cell phone hacking- a glimpse of ORACLE? wait till you see the bat-bike show up --- (eruption of cheers)Hardly any confusing effects, stunts or fights. Well choreographed and executed."
tt0361748,"Inglorious Basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy, gloriously so. Built on the framework of The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds ditches the elongated training sequences of The Dirty Dozen to plunge into the action right away. In the process, Tarantino fixes one of The Dirty Dozen's major flaws by giving the bad guys screen time to remind us just how bad the Nazis were. The Nazis with the most screen time end up becoming the most completely human characters in the film, which ironically makes them even worse monsters.Bu ditching the training sequences, Tarantino is also able to give us a picture of the entire war, showing us not only British, American and German soldiers, but also giving us glimpses into the world of French and German civilians, both collaborators and Resistance.It goes without saying that any Tarantino film is going to have fantastic dialogue, but when Tarantino made the decision to have the French characters speak French and the Germans speak German, beyond adding a level of authenticity, Tarantino also somehow ensured that his dialogue in French was as sharp and funny and clever as his English dialogue.Case in point, during the opening sequence the Nazi ""Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christian Waltz) is interrogating French dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Landa suspects that LaPadite is hiding a family of Jews. While subtly pressuring LaPadite, Landa asks for a glass of milk. After greedily gulping it down, Landa compliments LaPadite on his daughters and his cows, ""√† votre famille et √† vos vaches, je dis bravo."" The thing of it is, in French ""vache"" means cow, but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina. If reprimanded for this vulgar pun, Landa could quite convincingly claim not to understand French well enough to have meant it that way, but Landa does mean it that way and he means it as a threat. And LaPadite understands his meaning all too well.That is a really subtle piece of acting and word-play that many audiences would never catch, or at least they might understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat. The film is rich with that kind of detail. All of the French and English dialogue is chosen with that same attention to detail and while I can't swear to the German, I would suspect that it shows a similar level of craft.Inglorious Basterds opens with the phrase, ""Once Upon a Time... in Nazi-Occupied France."" Personally, this reminds me of the opening of every Asterix book and movie, another comic fantasy in a war-torn occupied France. Like Asterix, Inglorious Basterds is howlingly funny in places, although the film also turns darkly serious.In its more serious moments, Inglorious Basterds reminds us that the first casualties of war are compassion and the ability to relax, as in almost every elongated sequence of the film, Tarantino finds a new way to build cruel tension to almost unbearable levels.Tarantino also reminds us that film is dangerous, even inflammable and that its power deserves respect.If you can see this film as I did in a packed theatre filled with knowledgeable fans who get every joke, that you will see this masterful film the way that it was meant to be seen. If you are not that lucky, all that you will see is a great, great film that delivers a darkly funny punch."
tt0108052,"Probably the most powerful and important film one can watch in this or any lifetime. The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family, only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation, such will to survival.Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - ""I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word"".""Schindler's List"" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time, it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'."
tt0137523,"The Fight Club movie, like its more successful but equally troubled cousin The Matrix, has some philosophical themes, originality in presentation, and is also strong on satire. Another movie that it is similar in some ways is vastly superior and more intelligent and fun American Psycho. The plot is adapted from the eponymous book, which ""borrows"" ideas from Dostoevsky's ""The Double"" and puts some ""Thus spoke Zarathustra"" along a way. It is derivative and not very good, certainly not as good as its cult followers would suggest. In any case, given the hype, I was expecting more. There are some good points along the way - especially its anticipation of terrorism, and some good transformational scenes, like when confronting a boss, but overall, it comes across as much more shallow than its reputation would suggest. It is high on style and influence, has lot of ideas crammed in and it might have been even revolutionary in some respects for its time (like the Matrix, which I also find a bit missing), so perhaps its worth a watch, but it is not a perfect masterpiece some assume it is. It may seem so to perhaps teens, incels and millenials, but this is not the most successful nor sophisticated rendering of such ideas. Tone your expectations down, give it a try, this is a movie that can work in bits and pieces, has originality, but is sometimes given WAY too much credit."
tt1130884,"This is my first film directed by Martin Scorsese. And I am amazed at the script, the actors play, storyline. Undoubtedly, this is one of the best movies I have ever watched. Why I was interested in?Firstly, it is the atmosphere of the film. 1954. Many people watch films like this because they want to plunge into the atmosphere of antiquity. So, the spirit of antiquity is shown dynamically. Since the beginning of the film the contrast between the island and the outside world emphasize very clearly. And when the story starts to develop in a bad condition for Marshall, you begin to understand the hopelessness of the situation - and this ending seems really confusing and intriguing.Secondly, it is an actor's game. DiCaprio. And that's all. Wonderful play, emotions, story comprehension. Mark Ruffalo is able to create a perfect image of partner. I especially want to mention the scene in the room when Rachel called her husband Marshall.Thirdly, it is a plot. In my opinion, the further the film, the more puzzles which keep us in the entire movie screen. And all of the solution - at the end, though all at once. The plot is the most important. That's why you must to see the movie. You never know what it will end.Fourth, this is the place. The island with all its old buildings is perfectly suited to the scenario. Weather, fortress, mysterious hundreds of rats, ominous cliff ferry with shackles and horror picture, lighthouse are created for the brilliant creations Scorsese. I was surprised by the memories of the main hero. Camp Dachau, wind, dead bodies, burning by hate DiCaprio or the burning house with his wife. Everything is shown to stop the viewer's heart. I recommend this film."
tt0172495,"This was an interesting story, but historically was a little bit mixed up. It combines figures from different points in Roman History.  The real General Maximus was declared emperor after conquering Britain, by his troops and some locals. He then went to  Germany entered an alliance with the Emperor of the Eastern Empire.   He then attacked the Western empire and emperor Gratian and Gratian was killed in battle. Maximus ruled some of the northern and western provinces for a few years and then decided to invade Italy and took over the whole Western Empire for a year or so, then got into a war with the Eastern empire, and lost, and was executed. Marcus Aurelius was an interesting emperor, but he lived 200 years earlier.  His chief general in Germany was Avidius Cassius, who usurped him a couple of years before he died, and the conflict forced him to appoint Commodus as joint emperor several years before he died. Commodus went insane, (possibly due to lead poisoning), and was eventually strangled by a gladiator as part of an assassination plot by his sister and his own cabinet. Enjoy the movie, but try to keep it in historical perspective."
tt0114369,"David Fincher has been one of most thoughtful directors in Hollywood for many years, and his ingenious filmmaking all started in the mid- 1990s with this grim, but intelligently crafted psychological thriller. This film follows David Mills (played by Brad Pitt), a newly transferred police detective in an unnamed crime-ridden metropolitan city, who is partner with an old veteran detective William Somerset (played by Morgan Freeman) who is on the verge of retirement, to investigate a string of gruesome murders all around the city. These murders happen to correlate with the seven deadly sins which include: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy, and wrath. Mills and Somerset take in matters in their own hands to hunt down the sadistic serial killer (played by an actor who I'm gonna keep a secret) responsible for the grisly murders, only to be faced with a scarring truth about his intentions.This David Fincher masterpiece is not a horror film, but it certainly sits directly at the borderline of one. Complete with eerie visuals and near non-stop suspense from start to finish, this film pulls audience into an unflinchingly grim atmosphere that leaves shivers down their spine and rarely lightens up. To add more to the dark tone, it rain in nearly every scene taking place outside to give them a more somber look. As the plot progresses, the audience are treated with nauseating afterviews of the serial killer's murder. But instead of having the camera linger over the gory details of the victims, we are giving heavy implications of how they particularly occurred. These scenes do just enough without the suspenseful music score to leave viewers at the edge of their seats. Then there is the serial killer himself who is portrayed as very sadistic, almost Lecter Hannibul-like, and creepy in appearance. His way of outwitting the main characters are quite shocking. The actor who plays him does an incredible job on his portrayal. As the story continues on, it builds up to one of the most haunting conclusions ever put to film, an ending that really pushes the boundaries. Ultimately, it works pretty well.Se7en is one of the well-crafted and twisted thrillers I've ever seen and one of the spine-chilling films Hollywood has to offer, thanks to the incredible camera-work, brilliant direction by David Fincher and fantastic script by Andrew Kevin Walker. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman who play the main characters show amazing chemistry on screen together and their performances work pretty well. While the film is really great, it is definitely not recommended for the faint of heart."
tt0108052,"Oh wow, it's a Spielberg film, we can't say anything bad about that.  Oh wow, it's a movie about the Holocaust, we can't say anything about that.Oh wow, isn't this rampant conformity just sickening?  To me it is.  First off, yes I have seen Schindler's List.  I don't care if it did win Best Picture (I don't really give a damn about the Oscars in general), and I don't care if it did rank #9 on the AFI 100 list.  For me, it's too recent to be rated number nine when there are many films better than it and more deserving to be placed higher than it, such as Raging Bull and Dr. Strangelove.Schindler's List did not create any new styles in film making that I have seen, or have any real memorable moments in it the way other movies do. It was just Spielberg making something that he knew people wouldn't degrade because of fear.  Fear of standing outside the crowd and speaking what is on their mind.  Fear of being attacked for their beliefs, which is ironic considering what the movie is about.I have had to hear about the Holocaust almost every year I was in school, watching the same documentaries and reading the same books.  It gets very boring very fast when you have the same thing crammed down your throat year after year.  How can you expect one to remain shocked and appalled when you desensitize them by showing it to them all the time?Overrated to say the least.  Contrary to what someone else said, it is not better than On the Waterfront and Casablanca.  Those are classics."

tt0120815,"Perhaps having viewed this film at the cinema a couple of weeks after its debut tainted my expectations about 'Saving Private Ryan'. Perhaps the immense amount of hype precluding and following its release built the movie up just a little too much. Whatever the reason, I must admit that I found 'Saving Private Ryan' just a little tedious and pretentious. Don't get me wrong here, there's no genre of movie that I enjoy more than the good old [anti]war. 'Platoon', 'Apocalypse Now', 'Full Metal Jacket', 'All Quiet on the Western Front', '1918: Westfront', 'Stalingrad' and 'Das Boot' (all German productions) are among my all time favorite movies. I like a good, harsh, realistic war movie. And being a product of the electronic generation I can even sit through 'A Clockwork Orange' without even flinching, so the 'realistic' first 25 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' was just like water off a ducks back, to use the cliche.What really got to me about this movie was the element of compromise that marred 'Saving Private Ryan'. The introductory shot displaying that oh so wonderful 'stars and stripes' waving in the breeze. Perhaps it was national pride that caused the Second World War? Unforgivable. The return of this shot at the as yet far away conclusion of the film did little to appease my growing sense of ridicule at the film.However, on a positive note that famous first 25 minutes was a fairly fine piece of cinema. Fast, well coordinated, well coloured (not that I really know what I'm talking about here). But after such a fine beginning Speilburg simply cannot stop the movie slipping downhill from here. I got the impression that 'Saving Private Ryan' was two hours of relative nothing buffered by 20 minutes of pro-Yankee violence at each end. And, I'm sad to say, that is how the war came across. The Germans were still faceless, nameless enemies. Nazi's. The German film 'Stalingrad' (which I believe does the whole war thing far better than this effort) gives an excellent insight into the German side of things.So, in brief:* Far too patriotic for a modern day war film* Emptiness in between introduction and conclusion (totaling 2 hours)Still was above average though. But 'Saving Private Ryan' is by no means the greatest war film ever. There are many films which do the whole war thing much more sensitively, poetically, chaotically, brutally, realistically, bluntly, subtly. The greatest criticism I have for 'Saving Private Ryan' is that I didn't leave the cinema hating humanity for what it put all those involved in the war through, and showing what humanity was capable of. Which other movies do. It would appear that Spielberg decided against this perhaps for fear of diminishing his American audience, who might not have flocked to his movie in mainstream numbers if it were to put forward any message that suggested that ALL involved in wars are victims, not just the Americans."
tt0468569,"So this is the movie that created one box-office record after the other. I really expected quite something, but was left disappointed. It's definitely not a bad movie. There are many things that are good entertainment and worth watching and definitely one of the better movies this year, but come on it has so many flaws. If you think that a movie like matrix which is more original, more intelligent, better from its action-sequences and so on and so on just didn't earned that much at the box-office.The most disturbing thing is probably the amount of realism they tried to put in a comic book story. Which always confused me as a viewer. That doesn't work for me. I think there was a hype created in America that pleased the hardcore comic book fans but i think the main reason why it was so extremely successful in America is it's dealing with Americas 9/11 Trauma.The whole movie was kind of a propaganda movie for the government and its actual foreign policy.When you see Batman standing in the ruins of an exploded building together with the firemen it evokes images of 9/11. And America's desperate yearning for a hero. Someone who will clean up with this scum. But what made ""it"" a scum isn't really told. A super-villain like the joker is just mad in a comic book. But in real life who is mad and who is not is often just a matter of the point of view.The prisoners in the one boat evoke images of Guantanamo. And it justifies their illegal and often unjustified imprisonment of innocents with the words of the people of ""other boat"" . Why shall we have mercy with them. They blew their chance. But still we give them much more than they deserve. It still was a nice gesture giving them some kind of redemption by letting tiny lister throwing the detonator outside.In the end Batman stand for me as a symbol for ""W"", because he is blamed by the people even though he is doing it seemingly just for them and sometimes they don't appreciate it or even understand it.Next thing was how often and illogically they let the joker get away. I mean come on. The just cut to another scene and he is free. Thats so cheezy.Batman hits him up like nothing and the man doesn't even bleed a bit. Other real people he just hits once and they are K.O. I thought the Joker had no superpowers but here he seems invincible.Then you wonder how quick he has everything planned without ever getting a touch of an recruited army behind him , even though he seems to have tons and tons of toy soldiers. I a comic book it works but in a movie where they try to put a lot of realism in it it feels weird. First he is in prison but he is so foreseeing everything. Maybe i need to see it again. But it felt weird.The action sequences felt not really thought trough. The whole chase tunnel sequence was so unrealistic. i mean first the police somehow never hits back. And joker just shoots and shoots and shoots. And it felt unreal.Maggie Gyllenhall felt miscast. She maybe a favorite in art-house productions but here you need someone with obviously more sex-appeal. I never bought it that they fell for her.The the totally unrealistic wounds of Harvey dent turning into ""two-face"". Come on. No one would have such an open wound. Isn't ""Two-Face"" a mad scicophrenic in the books. Here he never feels mad, just like a guy trying to get his revenge. Thats what I mean, with the amount of realism. Here a mad character from the books is explained in his madness, but the main character the joker which is a synonym for any terrorist threatening America isn't explained a bit. Yeah better that way. One might get scarred that one self turned that man into a terrorist. So they better leave that explanation out.Then the much hyped about heath ledger (r.i.p.) performance. It was good but not that great. For me it was just an update of the Nicholson joker. He even talked much like him and his facial expressions also resembled Nicholson's expressions. So whats all the hype about. He is still performing very good but not legendary. I have seen better villains.Then it seemed like there were many points in the movie that resembled of ""L.A. Cofidential"" One scene in the end where they let Harvey dent die as a hero is one of them but there were others too which i forgot.So after all. Worth watching. Good movie. But too overrated. And i still don't understand the enormous box-office-records."
tt0068646,Definitely the most overrated movie ever. It's not bad but it's pretty slow. I've tried and failed to make it all the through it many times but I always fall asleep. Perfect example of a classic that's surviving on nostalgia. I'm sure for it's time it was revolutionary. Reminds me of when older folks talk about their favorite athletes from the past. Sure some of them are all time greats but let's be honest most of them just can't keep up with modern times. I'm 34 years old for reference in case I come off sounding like a child.
tt0397103,"My friend is visiting Shanghai and giving lectures to pharmacists in one of the hospitals. Her partner wrote me how shocked they were to learn that in China, an ostensibly Communist-governed country, the health care system is privately operated. And yet, to view this picture, you would never guess that the whole health system was not hunky-dory and just bursting to help deformed children. You could call this omission naive, or you could call it misleading---even dishonest. Smile is an advertisement for a regime that holds millions of dissenters in a gulag of slave factories and conducts a huge number of public executions per year. Furthermore, the perpetrators of the Tianenmen Square massacre have never been brought to justice, which goes fundamentally against human rights and human nature. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see Shanghai looking so comely, and Mika's super figure is waved around in almost every shot. The picture is a courageous attempt to sell Volunteering Overseas and for that it deserves brownie points, but can charity ever be divorced from politics? What price in oppression is this picture paying for its sanitised portrait of Communist China?"
tt0109842,"This film has one of the true great unsung performances in all  of cinema, in Sean Nelson as Fresh.

If y'all have seen the film, you know what I'm talking about."
tt0914805,"This is, without a doubt, a true masterpiece. The ending leaves you guessing and wanting for more, but not unsatisfied. The cinematography is beautifully done, it gives you a up-close and personal look at the characters. During the murder scenes you feel as though you are right there experiencing it with the Montgomerys. Paul McCloskey, and Barbara Lessin create a disgustingly casual feeling to the film that makes you want to hide under your blankets. Spadaccini truly captured the feeling of the Montgomery family and their sick passion. If you're squeamish I do not recommend this movie, as it is not for the faint of heart. Nonetheless this film will forever go down in my books as a classic. Job well done Mr. Spadaccini!"
tt0108052,"A very well crafted piece of art. A sheer example of how to Describe a story with perfect direction. This movie will always remain close to my heart.

Great work Liam Neeson."
tt1375666,"Films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird. ""Inception"" is no exception to that rule, but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion (i.e. ""The Matrix"" (1999), ""The Cell"" (2000), ""Abre Los Ojos"" (1997) & its American remake ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001)), you really can't look away, nor should you.""Inception"" is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype. It is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll. The less you know about this movie going in, the more you will be entranced by seeing it.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a world class criminal who, with the help of a team of sleep experts, works his way into people's subconscious and steals what people value most: ideas directly from their minds. In his last assignment to possibly clear his name, he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone, but to plant one inside that person's mind. The difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being taken.That plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story, but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe. DiCaprio is good in his role, but unlike many other films he has starred in, this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other co-star. Instead, this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work, just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy are especially good in their roles.The special effects in this film were also very good, which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the ""Matrix"" movies. There are slow-motion shots, but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences. It's especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams, and impossible sequences are filmed in a way I've never seen other than in drawings.However, the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasn't good. For this reason, even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film. The credit here can be given to writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has not made a bad film yet. There are many twists and turns in this film, but Nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story. If Nolan does not get nominated for Best Director and/or Best Original Screenplay next Oscar season, there is something terribly wrong with the Academy.That being said, there was still a lot about this film I still don't get, and may require multiple viewings to better understand. However, some of the best films I've seen are confusing at first. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) is a film I've seen a couple of times, and still don't understand completely. It still has a major following, though, as I'm positive this movie will. It's an incredibly entertaining movie, but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater."
tt0111161,Good stuff shawshank very emotional watch like a look
tt1130884,"From the look of the trailer, Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" looks more like a horror film¬Ö This is a dangerous place where isolation rules under fascist control. A U.S Marshall is sent to an asylum to investigate a missing patient but discovers so much more. A demon? A ghost? Something more? Is this going to be as disappointing as I think it is?I was skeptical walking into the theater, wondering if this twist could hold water. The film starts with Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck, standing on a ferry. They talk about their assignment. What's suspect here is that there is no additional development. We are bam, smack right into the story without so much as an opening montage. All that we see is the men smoking a couple cigarettes. Though this is what begins as momentous development. As our hero smokes we that this isn't the glorified top lit smoking of a beauty or that of a sophisticated and confident gangster. We see that this is a harsher character with poor posture, someone who doesn't sleep well, someone with a deep pastThey are greeted at the gate by guards whose attitudes' seem immediately suspect. Soon we meet Dr Crawley, a seemingly complex and modern man who runs the asylum. However, he soon turns uncooperative with the investigation. Inmates and staff are hiding something but what? Everyone here seems off. Evidence and clues begin to appear but not before our hero seems riddled by psychosis himself. ""You act like all this madness is contagious."" Daniels says to the guard. Is it? Soon we begin to wonder, too, but not before he uncovers the tip of the iceberg and it's not only painfully intimate with his own past but also a mass conspiracy. The Nazis had concentration camps and the Americans have Shutter Island.Though, it doesn't stop here, but to say anything else would do the story injustice¬Ö Kingsley is in his finest role in years. Similarly, DiCaprio reaches new levels. Amongst others Elias Koteas, Ted Levine, Michelle Williams, all play small but wonderful roles. Robert Richardson captures a world all of its own.While Scorsese is a master of film I'd say that his specialty has been more character than story. This is a fresh balance of both. It's a mix of noir and thriller. It's only sort of a horror movie and could be compared to ""The Shining"" but it makes it look like it's a one trick pony.All this praise being said it's not for everyone. The story is complex. It takes some attention. At times it's a bit bleak and dire. Of course it all makes a little less sense when you actually think about it but then again that's film. There are a couple of moments where the story gets lost within itself. Things become a bit too complicated. At this point you might begin to lose faith in its viscosity, but don't worry because the story has you right where its put you."
tt0381429,"This drama about a teen runaway rarely moves beyond clich√©s. Cornish is good if somewhat bland as the runaway who desperately seeks a man who'll take of her. Worthington is disappointing as a man Cornish meets. Not only does it seem like he's simply reading his lines, but his delivery is so rapid that it's hard to understand him, given his Australian accent. His character here is confusing. Although he's cool to Cornish's overtures, he gets angry when she shacks up with other guys. He's also confused about his sexual orientation. This is the first feature film of writer-director Shortland, and she seems unsure of herself."

tt1345836,"What the hell is wrong with people these days? Why does every impersonal, clich√©, unremarkable movie instantly gets in the top 250? Let alone the top 10? I was rather entertained with the two previous movies, mainly thanks to Liam Nesson and Heath Ledger who are fantastic actors. Overrated movies in my opinion, but good enough movies. But there's nothing to save this movie from Nolan's lack of talent this timeHere are the flaws already present in the previous movie that have not been corrected, or got even worse:-Batman's grunting, worse than ever. Jesus Christ you would think after all the mockery that's been done about it, he would at least try to improve that part a bit, but no it's actually more ridiculous than ever. - The music is omnipresent during the whole movie. It goes basically ""tchac boum tchac"" for all the movie, including the dialogue scenes. horrible artistic choice. - The action scenes, dull as hell. How can anyone fin this 'spectacular' is beyond me: there's no tension, intensity or drama in all of them. Nolan had too big a budget and decided to blow stuff up just for the hell of it.But there are new flaws as well! - The villain's motivations, which was what made the previous film interesting, are just completely incoherent! I won't say much more not to spoil anything, but believe me you just spend the whole movie asking yourself: why? why do this? - The villain himself. Without spoiling anything, let's just say all his back-story and charisma is destroyed by one silly, silly twist. - The villains' deaths have to be the most underwhelming I've ever seen. - The references about the current economic crisis: awwww look at these evil traders getting pointed a gun at, didn't they totally deserve it? Yawn. - The love interest. Wayne just randomly has sex with a woman he's barely met. Why? no idea.Overall this movie is dull as hell, and while I can see why people would like the first two movies, there really is nothing to save in that one."
tt0172495,"The denizens of the Roman Empire were a particularly bloodthirsty lot, and apparently not that far off in mentality from our own culture. The vox populi, bored to the heavens with the multitudinous burdens inflicted on them by their government, seek escape in the mind-numbingly bland entertainment provided within the Colosseum. Gladiators fend for their lives against a series of uniquely dressed foes and beasts, all in the hope of winning their freedom. Everything about this testosterone-toned epic is meant to cater to a population who likes their filmed landscapes served to them WWF-style.Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a top army general in the army of Marcus Auerlius (Richard Harris), a dying patriarch who (in predictable fashion) unwittingly causes trouble within the family ranks by offering his throne to Maximus instead of to his son Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix). Auerlius' son is the kind of whinny, pussy-whipped boy that your audience likes to hate because the character's moral fiber makes the character so easily expendable. Commodus' temper tantrums lead to patricide and the film turns into an interminably messy three-hour affair simply centering on the standard theme of revenge.Maximus is sent to die in the woods but manages to get the upper hand and kill Commodus' henchmen. He returns to his homestead only to find his wife and son lynched from trees. Poor Maximus is denied the throne of Rome and is now being fueled to wage a one-man war against the sissy who wiped away his entire family. As Maximus works his way back to Rome, unbeknownst to the new king Commodus, our foppish king swishes around the kingdom ridiculously hitting on his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielson) and hovering inappropriately over his nephew Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark).In the first hour Ridley Scott has expertly painted his archetypal figures, forcing us to love the brave Maximus, wifeless and sonless, and hate the creepy teenager with the thirst for forbidden fruit. Maximus, once back in Rome, manages to enter a gladiator troop manned by one Proximo, the late Oliver Reed. This little group of circus freaks will provide Maximus with the proper cover through which he can maneuver himself into the hearts of Rome's people. Not only is the man driven by revenge but he is also cocky enough to believe that he has what it takes to accomplish the sort of feats no other gladiator has been able to accomplish. By his side is Juba (Djimon Hounsou), the proverbial Black voice of wisdom. If not for Will Smith's more unfortunately stereotypical role in Legend of Bagger Vance, this would have been the kind of role that would have garnered the deserved scorn of people like Spike Lee.For two hours, Scott inundates us with endless arena fireworks that would serve the acrobatics of the Rock and Hulk Hogan to a much better effect. The characterization of Crowe's character amounts to nothing more than a cocksure man, full of false bravado, whose only apparent skill is to raise his arm into the air and scream for his men to surge into battle. He is the kind of screen character who wages war against hundreds of foes within the course of a movie and manages to dispose of all of them with relative ease. He is also the kind of superhero archetype that garners the admiration of young boys like Lucius, something which causes our dear Commodus to go even further over the edge.Scott is to be admired in the end for at least not being a hypocrite, as he practices what he preaches. Since the citizens of Rome seem only to live for bloodlust, Scott manages to paint Gladiator as nothing else than that: entertainment geared for audiences whose sole interest is seeing men and tigers beat the s**t out of each other for three hours. But if this is all there was to the film then one would see little complaints from my person but Scott makes the mistake of filling his film with arty flourishes.The film opens with Maximus walking across a field, his hands slowly caressing tall blades of grass. These flashbacks, along with various cutaways to fast-moving skyscapes, amount to nothing more than pretentious attempts to add artistic credibility to an otherwise sophomoric film. Its as if he is aware of the fact that his film is devoid of any three-dimensional resonance that he tries to quickly interject soft touches of humanity into the proceedings. The end result is nothing less than visual illiteracy, ringing completely false and cowardly.When it comes to epics none come better than Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev or Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, two masterworks from Russia's greatest directors that fully captured the three-dimensional scope of war. The bad guys in these films, unlike the one played by Phoenix in Gladiator, are the kinds of foes whose selfishly malicious journeys are never cartoonishly drawn. The landscapes created by the Russian masters were poetic and grand, full of visual and emotional urgency. Scott's film is amounts to nothing more than being beat over the head by a club for three hours."
tt0120815,"Spielberg has claimed in interviews that one of his purposes in making Saving Private Ryan was to specifically honor the soldiers who fought that war; a noble sentiment. But being a film buff, you'd think Spielberg would be familiar with the constant stream of films from the 40's through the 50's into the 60's and beyond including TV shows that did just that. It makes me wonder if he had another purpose in making Saving Private Ryan.He does. In the excellent series of interview DVD's put out by the American Film Institute titled The Directors, in the episode devoted to Spielberg he claims that he wanted to make Saving Private Ryan with a documentary style eschewing the Chapman Cranes and Steadicam approach to big budget film-making. He wanted the film to look exactly like a war photographer would have shot it had he been at Omaha Beach.Clearly, one look at the opening beach sequence shows he succeeded in that desire. But if Chapman cranes and Steadicams are not realistic, is artificially slowing down the film OK? How about de-saturating the color out of the film to make it almost seem black and white? What about heavily manipulating the soundtrack? Does war really exist in Dolby 5.1 Sound? I mean, what are we REALLY watching here? What has Spielberg done with Saving Private Ryan other than simply add an element of ""Chainsaw Massacre Movie"" gore to the war film, a genre that is surprisingly non-gory. But the thing that annoys me most about Saving Private Ryan is something that is no real fault of the film. It's the way so many people fatuously praise the film as being ""realistic"". A bunch of different critics even stated that this film ""avoids all the clich√©s"" usually associated with WWII films.Avoids clich√©s? Have any of you seen it? Well, lets just start with the squad who goes after Private Ryan in the film, do we have the tough, but decent guy from the Midwest? Check, Tom Hanks! Do we have a vaguely ethnic type? Check, Vin Diesel as Caparzo. How about the young coward who later on shows courage? Check with Jeremy Davies character. What about the wise guy from New York? Check with Ed Burns. Did we forget the country boy sharpshooter? No, we have Barry Pepper as a cross kissing sniper. You may just as well have cast Anthony Quinn, Wally Cassel, William Bendix, Lloyd Nolan and Richard Jaeckel. Certainly, John Wayne would have been perfect for the Tom Hanks role.Staying with realism, does Spielberg even get the facts of Omaha Beach right? The real plan was for the men to secure the beach and then have bulldozers knock down the sea wall. Tanks would then blast through German fortifications and then the men would follow the tanks. What really happened was that the water and tides were unexpectedly strong and the men were washed completely off course. That's why they landed directly in front of German machine gun nests; they certainly weren't heading there on purpose. After suffering terrible human losses and with the water being too deep for the tanks, (only 2 of the 29 tanks ever made it), the surviving men waited at the sea wall for five or six hours until German fire had died down and then they climbed up the sides of the bluffs, double-backed and attacked the Germans from behind, eventually over running them. That's what really happened. I found that out by simply looking this battle up in the Encyclopedia Britannica. Apparently, that is something no one at Paramount Pictures did because that is not what happens in the ""realistic"" Saving Private Ryan.Spielberg presents the Omaha Beach slaughter as if this is what happened all over on D-Day. Again, not true, in fact, troop casualties were much less than expected. Yes, more than 2000 soldiers died at Omaha Beach, which saw the fiercest fighting and was a terrible slaughter, but a fifteen miles down the coastline at Utah Beach, they suffered less than 200 casualties and even less to the north at Juno and Gold beaches. I'm not trying to be disingenuous here. I know Saving Private Ryan was about this specific group going into this particular battle, but overall, what was presented in Saving Private Ryan is not what most soldiers faced that day.But what is really unforgivable to me, if you watch Saving Private Ryan, is you will get no sense that anybody other than Americans were involved in this action. Remember, it was called The Allied Invasion, not The American Invasion, which might explain why Saving Private Ryan is hailed as being accurate over here, but in other countries, notably Britain and Canada, who also lost soldiers that day, they find this film laughable.Nobody minds that Spielberg fudged things historical in order to make a dramatic movie. But pretending you didn't is wrong. And yes, just because Paramount Pictures says this is the way it happened, don't make it so. Saving Private Ryan is clearly a well-intentioned film and was made with skill and care. But, ultimately it is nothing more than a feel good picture, full of flag waving banalities and video game style violence. It is World War II: The Ride. Steven Spielberg has made a gripping and entertaining film with Saving Private Ryan. But that's all. Let's save our Medals of Honor for those who show bravery in an actual war."

He goes after all the idiots running our country and points them out for what they really are.Yes he is biased, he has his opinion and speaks it loud and clear, but perhaps that's what makes him so good. Unlike a lot of other news groups which just spout off the latest talking points from Karl Rove, or what the Neo Cons would have them say, unlike the lame, democrat biased reporters who are too weak to stand up to our failed government policies and speak the truth. Keith is NOT afraid to tell it like it is. He and unlike those who try to defend the republicans, Keith actually shows proof and makes sense with what he says. Go to Rush, or Bill O'Reilly's show and you will find nothing but baseless claims, aimed at destroying freedom of speech, freedom of though and the American Way. This is Free America, NOT Natzi America! It's time we had more reporters like Keith Olbermann"
tt0429078,"Well, what to say what has not been said yet, saying that it's a magnificent masterpiece is just an understatement.Beautiful, barbarian, sublime, lyrical, except for its cinematic scope it has nothing in common with profit-driven, highly flawed swordplay film ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" that has brought nothing interesting and fresh to the genre except for the obvious commercialization.This movie was excellent, and really I cannot see how anyone who doesn't have ADD or any humanity cannot sit down and watch this movie.A nice example of another re-invention of the Chinese swordplay movies. Seven Swords is also one of the bigger films of this genre since The Blade and the films of the Shaw Brothers.The only thing I disliked was Donnie Yen (the only flaw on this film was the casting of his character)I saw this film with a couple of friends, and let me tell you that it was vividly seen on their eyes that every single one was totally mesmerized by this, later we were talking mostly just about this film the whole week.As for comparisons to Seven Samurai, while I must say I love that movie as well, I think this one has much more depth and raw humanity. It's much more emotional and inspirational to life... at least to me certainly.This is out of question the cinematic accomplishment of the highest proportions."
tt1375666,"OK here goes. I'll prepare myself for an ass kicking.I finish watching this film thinking are you guys really watching the same film as me!!?? Does this film really deserve 9.1 out of 10??? (1st sept 2010).I found this film incredibly frustrating. So I guess at the start you learn what a cool concept the film is based on. Nice idea. Very interesting. So why take over 2hrs to get to the point!!?? I fell asleep twice whilst watching it and still managed to catch the end - not feeling that i'd missed anything important.I didn't really like the characters. In these films you tend to connect with as least ONE character but I didn't feel it here at all.So some of you like the FX?? Yeah that ONE scene they used in the trailer. The one they sold the film on.Oh yeah. The last rant....i cant stand films where they introduce rules and details that only apply in the next few scenes. It so annoying and predictable. They do that a lot in this film.So anyway. I left asking myself and the other people I saw this with why this film is so overrated and there are a lack of bad reviews about it. We concluded its one of these trendy films that are meant to be clever and intelligent. I think people will be afraid of saying bad points about this just in case it suggests that they don't understand the concept. I for one did understand it, I just didn't like it. I certainly don't think it deserves 9.1 out of 10.My suggestion....just go and rent Matrix or Minority Report or something like that. Clever, visually brilliant AND enjoyable."
tt0993846,"Not for an instant can I recommend going to this movie. It has a few hilarious moments and for that it gets a non-zero rating, but it is really too much to stomach 3 (three!) hours of dumb jackasses behaving like wild reckless dumb jackasses, like the world only exists to serve and reward them. And time and time again, confronted with the truth that some actions eventually have their harsh consequences, they fail to react rationally and don't ever get out when things get hot until their actions take them to the critical point of no return where they can't keep escaping the inevitable and everything falls apart. The story seems to me just as an excuse to depict all that stupidity. I don't know if many people will bear it, I really didn't. It was a relief to see the movie end."
tt1375666,"Why are people going mental over this Matrix/Paprika wannabe? It's undeservingly credited for way to many things. Maybe I'm being too harsh since it's the best blockbuster in the last two years, but lets be honest. The first half of the movie is drowning in clich√©s and the rule 'show, don't tell' is not being utilized at all. Am I the only one who finds those tedious dialogues when they explain the whole plot (as if we were ten year olds) - really annoying? The real people in those situations would talk and react completely differently. That makes the character interactions and conversations barely believable and just empty.Also, actors who play Saito and Mal are really destroying any credibility of the drama and tension movie has. Saito (besides being a Morpheus wannabe) always talks as if he was simply happy he remembered the lines. And why, oh why do they have such unnatural, bad and forced accents? Ellen Page was a bad choice too (another clich√© - younger student learns everything sensei has to say in 2 min and then teaches HIM a lesson). DiCaprio wasted his talent here, his powerful acting was ruined by the forced tension of the movie and a lousy soundtrack (which apparently never stops).The second half of the movie was better and combined with the end gave a certain satisfaction in terms of mental food. Nolan really is a master of plot and king of moments - unfortunately this is obviously becoming his biggest weakness. The overall impression is: it could have been a LOT better. It's not awful, but giving it a 10 and calling it a benchmark is just ridiculous."
tt0137523,"This is one of the most Unpleasant Films you are likely to see. Making you Squirm is perhaps one of its 'Charms"" and part of what makes it a Teen Favorite.This is an Ugly Thing, both in Tone and the way it Looks. It starts out with a lot of Unsightly Stuff. Like the Victim Self-Help Meetings where we have to look at a Homely Woman, about to Die, looking to ""just get laid one more time before it ends"" and Meat Loaf with Huge Man-Breasts drooping to his waste being hugged by Ed Norton while exchanging Affection and Sweat.That's just the beginning. It gets a lot more Repulsive as things go along their Merry Way. We have the Central Conceit and Title of the Movie, that Place where Lonely Guys meet to Beat and Bond. Then things really get out of hand with a Zombie Squad and a lot of Speechifying about the Evils of Capitalism, Consumerism, and Zen Stuff like ""when you own your possessions they own you"" and other Well Worn Witicisims that might have been Insightful a Thousand Years Ago.If you are a Fan of those Bare Knuckle Cage Matches, Guy Ritchie Movies, Neo-Nazis, or Anarchists Anonymous, this may be Entertaining. But it can also be a Pseudo-Intellectual, Inane, Disturbing Diatribe that is not Cathartic, just a Vile, Witless Waste, Pretending to be an Ultra-Cool, Post-Modern Philosophical Guidepost for the New Millennium.The Film is Objectionable, Hideous, Unsightly, Overrated, Trashy, Dumbed-Down, Unforgivable, and Absolutely Awful. The Stylish, Talented Director can not be Forgiven for this Wildly out of Control Poisonous Picture."
tt0110912,"When I was finally going to see this movie for the first time, I was really excited because of all the good things that I had heard about it. When I got halfway through it, I found myself staring at the ceiling, wondering why it is so important to listen to people discuss pot bellies and the french way to say quarter pounder. I think there were some good scenes and some great one-liners, but the movie could have been at least 45 minutes shorter and had a story line that at least made a little bit of sense before you have to sit through it again just to piece together story. Overall, the idea for the story is OK, but the execution was off. I can see why a lot of people like it, but I think those people have too much time on their hands and need to start thinking about things like why we have a moron president instead of the relevance of a foot massage to shooting Marvin in the face."
tt0137523,"Last night was the very first time I have ever watched this movie. One of my Facebook friends bought me a copy because I had never seen it. I knew this movie had a cult following and after finally watching, I'm trying to understand why. Maybe if I watched it several more times, it'll grow on me, but I have a feeling I won't for quite a while. It wasn't all bad. It did have some decent and funny moments. I liked Helena Bonham Carter's character. The middle half of the movie was probably the best, but it went down-hill for me when the 'fight club' basically turned into a cult and the weird twist involving Brad Pitt's character.Edward Norton stars as a traveling automobile company employee who suffers from insomnia. He's known as The Narrator because he visits support groups to see how other people suffer. He eventually meets a woman a lot more miserable than him named Marla Singer. After his apartment explodes, he calls up Tyler Durden, a man who he befriended on a plane. They slowly start a 'Fight Club' where guys meet up and just beat each other up. If you like movies that are supposed to be considered 'great' you might enjoy FIGHT CLUB!!!"
tt0108052,"I found this movie to be very boring. Not sure what people could possibly see in it. I went with some friends who wanted to see it the 1st day it was released in the theaters. The whole first hour was just about this guy setting up a pots and pans factory. I was ready to just walk out at that point, but my friends wanted to stay so I was stuck there watching the rest of this.I've seen many documentaries on A&E, History Channel, etc on the holocaust and I guess I just presumed that everyone else had too. Apparently a lot of people never have, never read about it in school or anything either. After it was over, these people in the theater were all sitting there like they were stunned or something. Like they just had no idea that stuff like that happened during WWII. I was thinking to myself ""lets just get the heck out of here"".If you never get drawn into a movie at the beginning, it can sometimes be too late - no matter if it gets better later on you can just lose any interest in it."
tt0137523,"Knowing little of it just from the look, I didn't think I was going to like this film but it turned out to be a gem. The way the story unfolded was cleverly done to reveal a great twist in the end.It's an extraordinary story with some profound messages and interesting points about society that's definitely food for thought to take away.I cannot fault the casting, the actors were brilliant... including Meatloaf."
tt0993846,"Excessive sex and scenes like the part were Donny was giving his money to the dude from Walking Dead, yea that dude Shane. The sex scenes made me uneasy in the theaters but the old dudes three rows below me loved it. I think to me the main focus was on the drug and sex scenes. The last time Jordan(Leonardo) had sex with his soon to be ex wife made me think of his wife in the movie as Bar Refaeli. I'm like damn! Leo you lucky bastard! Right now I feel like a song coming up. Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens Brown paper packages tied up with strings These are a few of my favorite thingsCream colored ponies and crisp apple streudels Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings These are a few of my favorite thingsGirls in white dresses with blue satin sashes Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes Silver white winters that melt into springs These are a few of my favorite thingsWhen the dog bites When the bee stings When I'm feeling sad I simply remember my favorite things And then I don't feel so bad.I'm giving this movie three stars because I like Leo, I became a fan after his movie with his best buds Toby and Jerry Maguire."
tt0167260,"Sure, the burning guy has all the time to travel from the burial chambers to the front of the large balcony. Convienently placed there is a gap so that he can jump without having to climb a fence or wall first. Whom are they kidding?What happened to Tolkiens precious prosa? The dialogue reminded me of a better B movie. What happened to Tolkiens story at all? Distorted. Raped. Stomped into the ground. It's a shame that one of the best books in the world ends up this way, hollywoodized to the max (though it's not from hollywood, but it would like to be).I think one of the problems stems from the fact that the first two parts - which I did like a lot - omitted so much of the storyline that the third pic had to be just what it is: an empty shell. An action movie. ugh.Brilliant visuals though. Made it at least bearable.I'll give the extended DVD release a try, and I hope it makes more sense."
tt0111161,"Shawshank Redemption is overrated. It's a decent, above average film, but by no means a great film.The inmates are pretty much likeable, while the warden and his pet guard are monsters. Also as Freeman's character says: ""You know that everybody in here's innocent?"" As the story develops you feel like he is right, the only criminals are the ones guarding the prisoners.This is a sentimental piece made to stir the emotions, but not to stir them too much. Just enough to make the viewer feel there is injustice in the world but that in the end everything ends well and justice surely comes to he who waits 20 years or so for it.The Shawshank Redemption is, as I said, a decent film, possibly among the top five films of 1994. IMO the best films of 1994 are Pulp Fiction and L√©on."
tt0848228,"I walked in the cinema when there was about 1/2 hour left of the movie. I thought I had entered the wrong hall in the complex and had walked into the Transformers 3 performance.Same snake type cgi, same scenes of cars flying around, same type of buildings being wrecked and in the same manner.The only apparent difference was the main characters which made me realise I was not watching Transformers 3 but something strangely similar. I had seen enough and did not stay in the hall to watch the film from the start.I can't understand why this film got a 8.6 note. Perhaps everyone who participated logged in and gave it 10?I gave it 2 instead of 1 only because Jenny Agutter is in it."
tt0361748,"Quentin Terintino latest action film takes place in a Nazi occupied France. Brad Pitt stars as a American Jew- rebelling against the Nazi's. I thought this movie was alright. I actually almost disliked, the movie except for the amazing last scene in the film. (not going to give any spoilers away).The beginning of the Film was fantastic the opening act was superb keeping me interested and wanting more and more of the film,then by the close to middle of the film, it all went downhill. From the appearance to actors who did not have to be in this movie to a bar fight that had no purpose the movie just got plane boring. The action scene's from the beginning of the movie disappeared and i felt like the movie was going no were. Quentin has lost his touch in my option but thats a hole different issue.Although, the middle of the film bored me (almost to sleep) the end of the film was absolutely spectacular. Showed me that Quentin could still create one of the greatest acts of violence and death i have ever seen in cinema. This final act of hate, anger, revenge and a huge pool of other emotions allowed me to see the real potential that this movie had, just like it did in the beginning scene's of the film.Overall, i give this film 5 stars out of 10, although it had one of the greatest action endings i have ever seen, the entire middle of the film, (which is a while because this film is around 2 hours and 30 minutes) was horrid and there was no action and nothing interesting at all. People may disagree and say Quentin is back and better but i say this movie was a interesting idea and well acted by Brad Pitt, and had an amazing final act but it just lacked the interest factor and the suspense and intrigue that Quentin's other movies such as Pulp Fiction, And Kill Bill both had."
tt0816692,"""Interstellar"" directed by Christopher Nolan was released in 2014. This film is about astronauts and scientists who went to another galaxy to find a new planet for human life. The soundtrack in the film keeps us focused and tense throughout the film. The plot is complex, fascinating and attention-grabbing from the beginning to the very end. Starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine and many others. Scientists go into space where they have discussions, disagreements, disputes. The main breakthrough in this film was the image of a black hole. As for me, this is the best film in Nolan's filmography. Soundtracks, special effects, characters, plot."
tt0328671,Fully Entertaining MovieRishi kapoor Salman Kader and all others acted really well.Very fine made drama.Pure family movie.
tt0459135,"I saw this fine short after watching Utopia Parkway, and while this shares a lot of the same forms, colors, and style as Joanna's other work, this one is dazzling in anything as much as complication. There's a lot of stuff going on with sculptures, clay models, paintings, drawings, mirrors, magnifying glasses, water, and so on that it's impossible to keep up with in just one viewing.Honestly I wouldn't know where to start making this, though it's not anything that I would say, ""I wouldn't know where to start figuring this out."" This isn't the figure-out type of art, this is the sit back and enjoy, sit for a while and enjoy again, and seriously sit down and enjoy this kind of art. It's really quite... fun! But complicated... very fascinatingly complicated.--PolarisDiB"
tt0137523,"Everything about Fight Club is simply amazing. The acting, the directing, and the story is simply superb. However, going into this film I had already had had some of the major twists spoiled for me, and this is a movie that relies so heavily on those twists that knowing them will detract from the experience significantly. Because of that, the film is really only worth seeing of you have no prior knowledge of it whatsoever."
tt0120737,"A great film makes you wonder, at the end, where all the time went. Sadly, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is not a great film. In this regard, it is barely a good film. I was not engrossed in the story, and I left feeling like I knew nothing more about Middle Earth than I did before it started. I sat through it simply waiting for it to END. (With a nearly-three-hour running time, the film feels interminable.) The mythology did not come alive for me, someone who hasn't read a word of Tolkien, and that should have been the film's goal. The production is huge, the special effects are flashy, and the same could be said of a dud like ""Pearl Harbor."" Tolkien fans may be going wild, but I was simply bored."
tt0120737,"In twenty years, everybody will more or less agree that this was just a fairly unimaginative and clumsy b-movie, despite all the fuss and all the special effects that looked so nice back then.Tolkien's book is not flawless, but whether you happen to be a fan of the original or not, Jackson's movie fails as a based-on-a-book work: it is neither faithful enough or independent enough to justify itself. Even worse, it tries so hard to be something grand that it also fails to be a simple but entertaining adventure film.If there's one thing this movie should be remembered for in the history of cinema, it is the strong influence it had on the emerging tradition of using loud noises and spook visuals to build tension instead of resorting to decent scriptwriting, acting and directing."
tt1853728,"I barely made it through this movie, I was so bored, it barely kept my interest from start to end and I found myself checking my watch more and more around the 2hour mark. I've seen the original and I loved it, I seen it many many years ago back when it was re-certified and re-released.I don't like Tarantino but on the request of a friend I decided to see it. I went in hoping, much like The Dark Knight Rises, hoping the movie would be good, I gave it a chance and I did not enjoy it, sure people will like it, I knew nothing going in other then it was a re-make or a homage to it, but I found it drawn out and so slowly paced that when the action finally did come I was to bored to enjoy it.The action, when it happens, is good, thats why I'm not saying this is an awful movie, as it was interesting.The filler between main plot points is drawn out to, it artificially extends the life of the movie by at least an hour and adds very little to the pacing other then to slow it down.I'll probably get grief over saying it but its my opinion. If you loved it then you loved it but if you like redone ideas, 100 things you've seen before and Tarantinos usual over the top blood effects then this movie is for you. You'd be far better watching the original, a far better story and superior pacing."
tt0109830,"Forrest Gump, I think is a beautiful film. Never too schmaltzy, but there are some genuine tearjerkers like Forrest at Jenny's grave. The cinematography is stunning, the costumes are lovely and the scenery is gorgeous. The music is also very calm and relaxing, perhaps adding to the tone of this film. The screenplay is well crafted, and the story is simple. But what made this movie was its simplicity; it never tries to be too complex and is consequently moving. The acting is just as impressive; whilst Tom Hanks's accent is a little awkward in places, my only real criticism of this movie, he gives a truly remarkable performance, though I do think Morgan Freeman deserved the Oscar more for Shawshank. Robin Wright gives possibly the best performance of her career, and Sally Field is very dignified as Forrest's mother. The scene stealer though is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, a very moving and insightful performance. Overall, an extremely good movie, I will admit I wasn't sure whether I would like it, but the simple answer is this, I do. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
tt1345836,"It's not easy to make a good film. Thats why people can be so passionate about film that evoke real emotion when they are gripped by plots which enthral them, characters who touch them and themes that are instantly absorbing and recognisable. Not many individuals can attain par excellence in story telling, as it is a finely balanced art that little understand yet alone can duplicate frivolously. If any such individual today can create masterpieces of entertainment, then Christopher Nolan should surely be high up on the list.I had high expectations of a movie that would be well sculpted, like an old master who delicately forms his creation with a finesse that only years of experience and an absolute love of their work can produce, but not so.Here's why...The movie seemed hurried, despite me willing it to end during the last half hour and it being almost three hours long! It felt overly scripted and complex like the script writers were tying too much almost. There was no real enticing flow to the narrative and there were far too many side plots happening simultaneously which was tiresome and frustrating to follow in a 'blink and you've missed it' way. The fight scenes were poorly choreographed and lacking substance at times with no real emotion in them. The plot twist did surprise me, however, I felt it lacked creativeness and credibility due to the poor character development. Character development was a weakness which plagued the movie. Some characters seemed underdeveloped and unconvincing and whats more I felt the actors thought this too, as proved exceptional acting talent seemed unable to deliver the gritty realism that they are renowned for with more than one lacklustre performance.So what's good about the movie?Visually it ticks all the boxes, dazzling your senses with big bold cinematic cityscapes, pyrotechnic frenzies of explosions and an atmospheric melancholy that visually captures Waynes persona perfectly and harks back to the previous movies, establishing the new film as being cut from the same cloth. A credit to the camera/production crew. The special effects also showed the skill of some of Hollywood's best graphic talent, not cheap. Amongst the humdrum of acting lethargy there were some Sterling performances, mainly in the form of Bale who's inspired acting manages to not get dragged down by the wooden staleness surrounding him at times.To sum up...It felt like a poor effort and a typical Hollywood 'money in the bank' job. (Commercial exploitation of previous greatness which is to be expected and frankly, who wouldn't? The film industry is a business after-all) You'll still watch it though. I hope Nolan's next work is not pressured from the money men and his creativity is given the unfettered freedom it deserves. Ultimately this movie should make you realise what an extraordinary talent Heath Ledger truly was.Thanks for reading!"
tt0422272,"Picking this up in the video shop, I wasn't too sure whether it would be as good as it seemed. Thinking it to be one of those badly written thrillers then I reluctantly decided to give it a go. Why Not? I had free movie rental vouchers, so I may as well! On watching it, I was impressed by the writing and the direction of the film. It wasn't just another bad shot at shocking the audience, It as actually a good film. Filmed with tense scenes and pretty surprising twists, it had you on the edge of your seat. I managed to work out what was going to happen just has Flockharts character did. The scary looking nurse who was clinging to the children in the hospital and causing them injuries so they were prevented from leaving. It was tense and exciting from the start. Calista played a good role, one which was miles away from her Abby Mcbeal days, showing just how well she can perform."
tt0848228,"I was lucky enough to score tickets to a prescreening of The Avengers in my city. I'd loved all the other Marvel movies leading up to it, so I was really stoked.The Avengers is the superhero movie we've been waiting for. Don't get me wrong, I love the darkness of other superhero movies, like The Dark Knight, but as Nick Fury aptly puts it: ""maybe we need a little old-fashioned"". And this movie is exactly that. Joss Whedon gives us precisely what superheroes used to be - extraordinary people fighting their flaws to become the saviors of the human race.In all fairness, The Avengers is not a film that requires much thought. It's a beautiful spectacle, but it definitely does not possess Oscar-worthy performances. It's slightly campy and tongue-in-cheek, which is oddly refreshing. The Avengers never takes itself too seriously, which I think a lot of people aren't getting (hence some extremely scathing reviews on here!)With the exception of Mark Ruffalo, every actor has gotten a chance to explore their characters in a previous movie, which adds to the ""easy-breezy feel"" of the movie. That being said, I thought Mark Ruffalo was a wonderful Bruce Banner -- I'd love to see him in his own movie.The action is non-stop and the CGI is phenomenal. However, this is another case of unnecessary 3D. It's didn't add anything to the effects, except muddle them up on occasion when there was a lot going on. This movie could be shown normally and it would almost be better.Believe the hype. This is an awesome movie. Joss Whedon did an fantastic job with the movie. I can't wait for The Avengers 2."
tt0848228,"The movie was shouting so loud to catch attention and it certainly did. Too bad it was so disappointing and shallow afterwards... 3D did not entertain or maybe dragged the whole movie down even more than the sad plot.From the beginning it was clear to me that the movie won't jump high enough and come up to my expectations, all I had to do was watch the trailer and it told me how the whole movie will be - explosions, dorky costumes, pointless dialogs and lame jokes that recently have flooded Hollywood.Surely when the Avengers came out and I saw the rating (8.8 ?!), I assumed that I was wrong. Such great score! I just had to see this magnificent, most brilliant movie ever.Time in the theater passed and my little sparkle died rather quickly. Not only did some parts could have been cut out to shorten the torture, but they could have added a little bit of originality too. No matter how I look at it, some scenes and ideas resemble Transformers 3.This was not brilliant at all. Perhaps when overjoyed comic lovers settles down the Avengers will reach its true rating and be remembered as another common Hollywood's trash.As for now I can only weep for my money."
tt0111161,"It bugs me that this movie is rated so high- not because it's a ""bad"" movie, but because it's a mediocre one. Apparently, mediocre people reward mediocre cinema. This movie tanked big-time when it was initially released, and with good reason. It wasn't until pseudo-intellectuals across the country started hyping it as defacto ""favorite movie"" for Lowbrows world-wide that it started dominating the IMDb ""best movie"" list. In reality, ""Shawshank"" is like a sewage pump for every idiotic Prison Movie clich√© ever made. Every guard is a monster. The warden is religious, therefore Evil. Not a single prisoner is actually guilty, or if they are, they're so obviously redeemed that we're supposed to feel sorry for their unfair imprisonment. Murderers and sex offenders sit around in beatific awe as Opera plays over the loudspeakers. Right. The whole movie is so fake, so smarmy, and so condescending that it's no wonder that so many Americans, (with their odd addiction to fake, smarmy, condescending things) consider it their ""favorite movie"". I guess thinking for yourself is a burden to great for some of us to bear."
tt0120737,"Of course, by now, everyone knows about ""Lord of the Rings"". What I say will probably be nothing new.For those of you claiming that LOTR (any installment) is the ""best movie ever"", I will have to say that I disagree. LOTR is a very impressive achievement in modern cinema. It actually managed to tone down the stifling testosterone index of a SFX orgy into a respectable epic. The movie does justice to the scale of the books, even though there is still a lot of material from the books that was omitted from the films. This is understandable; the incorporation of Tom Bombadil into ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" would have made it impractical as a mainstream release.Jackson deserves applause for simply staying on top of such a massive production. His directing style is one that is well-received by today's audiences, hence the popularity of the series. Personally, I find the films to be overly emotional and melodramatic at times, but I will admit that this is because of my personality.My only real complaint concerning LOTR is not with the films themselves, but with the niche that they have carved into our culture. I object very strongly to those who assert that they are the ""best ever"". LOTR should be appreciated as a progressive step in the history and science of film media, not as the focal point or culminating moment of a nearly century-old industry. Personally, I would rather watch ""Star Wars"" (the original trilogy, that is), ""Lawrence of Arabia"", or even ""Casablanca"" on any given day than LOTR. LOTR should be acknowledged for what it is, not for what the mainstream audience wants it to be. Maintain some variety, as well as respect for previous, time-honored works. After ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"", LOTR is definitely the best movie I've seen in theaters in recent years. This is what modern cinema is creating today. LOTR can't truly be compared to vintage great films (such as those I mentioned), because it's in a different league.I suppose I am addressing the younger generations, for the most part, and of which I myself am a part. I understand, also, that there are young people who do appreciate other films besides LOTR, ""The Matrix"", and ""Napoleon Dynamite"". For those who I just mentioned, your judgment of entertainment is refreshing. For those others, keep in mind that 40 yrs. before LOTR came out, movies were still entertaining. Of all the movies ever made, really, what are the chances that LOTR is the ""best ever""? It doesn't have to be the ""best ever"" as long as it continues to be good enough.By the way, if you liked the movies, check out the books."
tt0172495,"I'm not going to talk about the historical truth - one should not expect this from epic movies anyway. The problem is - I cannot understand where is this meaningful 'plot' in this movie. A Roman prince cannot dispose of a slave? (recipe: kill him silently, then kill at the Arena someone who looks similar). One cannot kill a sleeping man (s)he wants to be dead? (this man IS reachable and how about a poison instead of sleeping pills?). A new emperor suffers from a lack of female attention?(does word 'hetaera' ring a bell?).But the above is not the worst. The worst is the characters. They are flat and lifeless. Chess pieces have more personality. In the real life if a homo sapiens does something, this means  he has some reason to do it (this reason may be an emotional one but it does exist). Not so in this movie. If Commodus does something, it serves only one of the purposes: to show how evil he is, or to advance the 'plot'. Don't try to find a reason or to understand why he does something - the story-writer wants him to do it and that's enough here. Maximus - see above but replace 'evil' with 'good or suffering'. Lucilla exists to build schemes , to be the weakest point of these schemes and to be a woman (almost the only one in the movie). That's all. Behind almost every scene I see a shadow of the story-writer who wants this scene to be that way - no matter does it make any sense or not, no matter if such scene is even slightly possible. Frustrating.Don't get me wrong - the movie is beautiful and visually detailed. But I expect of a movie significantly more than to be a set of beautiful pictures.2 for the story and 10 for everything else."
tt0167261,"This movie presented me with a dilemma. I read and loved the book, and I sure did like the first one. I realize that to make a movie you can¬¥t just follow the book (that would take at least a 20 hour movie) but why waste time in details shown in the book while discarding some important effects the book causes? For example, Frodo¬¥s journey becomes unbearable in the book, here it only seems like a long walk, only uncomfortable. And the story, honestly, becomes to slow and long for a movie. It¬¥s ok for the book to be slow because it gives us time to enjoy the details of Tolkien¬¥s work, but in the movie is just a waste of time. Besides all it¬¥s downsides, it has most of what people should expect: Absolutely AMAZING special effects, Gollum is as real as it gets and the battle scene it¬¥s marvellous, but it comes too late. My girlfriend didn¬¥t read the book and thought the movie was allright, not as surprising as the first one, but good. So, to sum it up, for me it can barely make it. It has a 10 in special effects, but a 2 in the plot."
tt0361748,"The first half of this movie was quite good. It was interesting and suspenseful. The second half was pretty bad. The comic book revenge story came full circle and we see lots of comic Nazi characters and some badly acted ""good guys"" blowing them away. There's a lot of violence in this movie. I'm not squeamish about violence but I think it should at least have some purpose in a movie. There was little purpose to the violence here except to create a genre film where we see lots of people getting mowed down with rifles. We're somehow supposed to be amused by this.I watched Reservoir Dogs recently. There was a movie where violence was employed effectively. It was realistic within the world the movie created. There were never any over-the-top sound effect. It was a crime movie which played it straight. Inglorious Basterds should have played it straight but didn't. I was rolling my eyes at how the violence was exaggerated with sound effects and extra bullets to the head and face.None of the back-story of any of the Basterds is really explained either, they're simply Nazi hunters. We don't really get to like any of them either because they're too busy cutting scalps off and shooting people in the face. It's all about ""revenge"" and very little else.There was 2 1/2 hours to work with here but few of the Basterds were really examined in depth. This seems like it was simply a revenge flick pure and simple. We saw that in Tarantino's last flick, ""Death Proof"" which I didn't care for either. It suffered the same problems. The characters were almost interchangeable.The first half again, was pretty good. I wanted to see the exploits of the Inglorious Basterds across Europe. I was presented with a much lamer movie about the resistance movement plotting revenge against some comic book Nazis when they all go to one movie premiere in France."
tt0068646,"G: i personally would say 8 out of 10 but the movie does drag on which is why i have to rate it a bit lower
C: Heard too much about movie so expectations were set too high, disappointed seemed over-hyped. 7 out of 10."
tt0172495,"Okay maybe a 2 out of 10 is a bit harsh but it can make up for the ridiculous ratings of 10 out of 10. This movie was nothing new. It wasn't gripping, or interesting, or factual, it was just boring, I was waiting for it to get kicking all the time. I decided to watch it because of the high ratings and I remember quite enjoying Ben Herr and Spartacus but all this filmed seemed to be was lots of long beautifully filmed shots of the scenery. The fight scenes were good but didn't help make the film any more interesting. The acting was good, but didn't help make the plot any better. And overall I was just board and disappointed that i had wasted an evening watching that film."
tt0167260,"Moves even further from the source material, more so than The Two Towers by Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh. Too many elements are changed from the heart of Tolkien's work. Sam would never have been turned away, and by the way, just how did he find that sword and the light of Elendil in Shelob's lair with no light source? Also, Shelob is spider like, but not a spider. There were no webs in her lair. Even worse is the acting of John Noble as Denethor. Yes, Denethor has despaired, but in the book, his madness is related to his use of a palantir and competing against Sauron. Sauron's will was stronger, and he bent Denethor, left him bereft of hope. This movie, he is a caricature, a cheap, poorly rendered, badly overacted caricature. Faramir's character was assassinated in the second movie, but it is his father who is torn asunder even worse in this one. Aragorn had the sword Anduril after he left Elrond and Rivendell, and says so in the The Two Towers before entering the hall to meet with Wormtongue and Theoden(book). Here, it is given to him by Elrond who never came to visit Aragorn. It was Elrond's sons and the remaining rangers(who allude to no longer protecting the borders of the shire, foreshadowing the scouring) who came to him. And they brought the banner of the king, not the sword. Aragorn acts like a haughty king in the Paths of the Dead, where in the book the scenario is much more dramatic with his humility and doubts. Also, the dead were released after helping them capture the ships with black sails so were not present at the battle at Pellenor Fields. That scene looked like The Frighteners Part 2. Absolutely ridiculous. It is a pretty to look at movie with no substance when compared to the source material. Tolkien loved the Scouring of the Shire, and felt it was the true climax of the entire work. Yet Peter Jackson called it a ""simple denouement"" and said he hated it. The better story isn't in these movies, and I hope that people can read with a finer eye than they watch these movies with. They aren't that good, and each slips further down. The first adaptation was the best of the three, and this was the worst hands down, yet this one received an Oscar for best adaptation."
tt0108052,"When I was in high school our history teacher showed us this movie. Later, as a young adult, I rewatched it while rediscovering the filmography of Steven Spielberg. More time passed, I became a history teacher myself and showed it to my students.If I have kids, I will show them this masterpiece someday.It is more than just entertainment based upon historical events. It is a lesson. And a big one for ourselves and later generations."
tt0109830,"Entertaining comedy/drama/fantasy has a lot to keep you busy (and excellent special effects), but doesn't measure up to its epic pretensions. It would've benefited from sticking to comedy and eschewing sentiment. Instead it pushes every button imaginable to jerk a reaction out of the viewer, and tries to dictate your emotions with a pushy music score. The movie lapses into silliness at times, and is self-indulgent for the last hour. Director Robert Zemeckis attempts to evoke each era by illustrating its clich√©s and by scoring it to a procession of over-familiar songs that serve as lazy, embarrassingly obvious signifiers of their times (Sweet Home Alabama, Hound Dog, Blowin' in the Wind, California Dreamin', For What it's Worth, On the Road Again, Mrs. Robinson, etc.). I love a lot of those songs, but they've become clich√©s themselves by now. Tom Hanks is funny and convincing in the title role, but Forrest is too much of an invincible saint to be very interesting."
tt1853728,"Another disappointment from Tarantino. A juvenile, self-indulgent and boring movie from a video rental clerk that repeats the same gimmicks as all the previous movies since Jackie Brown, his masterpiece. Pointless music, pointless violence, pointless humor and a pointless story. A western blood-fest with a hip-hop soundtrack made to look like a black power movie, please.Still hoping that Tarantino would group up and become the great film maker that he was becoming with his first three movies. Now he just makes pointless and violent genre bending movies with no ambition. The movies have become his persona playground with no artistic vision or ambition."
tt0167260,"I can't believe this movie won so many Oscars. Sure it was technically sound and all but damn was it boring. This is one of the few movies I have been tempted to walk out of. The last movie I walked out of was Spawn if that gives you any idea how little I enjoyed this movie. Its not that I don't have the attention span, some of my favorite movies are ""7 Samurai"" and ""The Great Escape"". I think we have all been brainwashed or maybe just starved for a good fantasy movie to come along.Anyways, for all the technical achievements and production value I give it 6/10.Please don't make ""The Hobbit""."
tt1853728,"After all the hype, all the articles and reviews, after all the controversy over the 'n' word, after all is said and done, Tarantino kicks butt again and comes up with a terrifically entertaining movie. Notice I said entertaining and not necessarily enjoyable. There are a number of scenes that are clearly not enjoyable, in fact, downright troubling like the dog attack of the black slave D'Artagnan (Ato Essandoh) and the hot box scene involving Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). But over all, Tarantino has fashioned a well told revenge tale modeled on the Spaghetti Western genre of the Seventies. And it begins immediately with a classy credit for the 'friendly participation of Franco Nero', the original coffin dragging gunslinger from the 1966 film who's name is resurrected here because frankly, it just sounds really cool.Now here's the problem I have with folks who find racism around every corner - when a movie depicts events or themes that have racism at it's core, it doesn't mean that the picture or the film maker is racist or is making a racist statement. The entire controversy in the media surrounding the use of the 'n' word here is a prime example of critiquing the movie as a racist film. Personally, whenever I heard it used in the picture, it sounded to me like part of the era's vernacular and not as a pretext for sensationalism. So here's a question I have for the critics - when will you put Jamie Foxx and Samuel L. Jackson on the spot for their participation in the project? Are they being racist, or are they artists? Or is it only Quentin who has to answer for the film's language and subject matter?What I didn't expect from the movie was the amount of humor and comedic dialog that came along with it. The bag head scene was surreally comic and just mind blowingly funny, but you really have to listen to the dialog to get it. The guy who was upset over the critique of his wife's working on the hoods was something one could easily relate to, and yet it sounded completely ludicrous even in context. I guess you have to be a little warped to come up with something like that, but warped seems to be right up Tarantino's alley. He proves it once and for all when he has Django blow himself sky high with the bag of dynamite. Priceless.As for the violence, well it's red meat bloody and about as visceral as it gets, so if you're on the squeamish side, there are a few scenes that may give you the heaves. It's one area where the director explicitly goes over the top and much of it is quite unbelievable. I have to admit though, the 'say goodbye' scene with Miss Lara Lee (Laura Cayouette) was the best, and it wasn't bloody at all. That was one of the times the picture entered 'Kill Bill' territory.As for a recommendation, you'll just have to guage your own preferences. I'm a Western movie and Tarantino fan and there was no way I was going to miss this. Casual movie goers with a low tolerance for gore and gratuitous shoot 'em up scenes should most likely stay away. Finally, for those hung up about the media's fascination with the 'n' word, I tried keeping up with the count as the picture progressed. I've read accounts that placed the number at well over a hundred, but I came up with seventy seven myself, realizing that I probably missed a few because it's easy to have your attention diverted by other elements in the story. No reason we can't get a recount with captioning on the DVD when it comes out."
tt0137523,"If you find anything at all edifying in this film then you must be incredibly gullible--even for a filmgoer.  Never got past the idea that we were being sold this supposed critique of our consumerist, soulless society by none other than News Corporation (Rupert Murdoch).  These people are just toying with you--they're in it for the money and have no conviction whatsoever (as is born out by the ending--the film goes...NOWHERE).  Avoid this nonsense."
tt0848228,"I was not prepared to sit and watch past the first five minutes with all the jerky shakycam going on... Gave me a headache trying to watch it.
It seems all you need these days to make a movie, just shake the camera for a couple of hours... Not."
tt0993846,"First, the good: DiCaprio does a very good job of portraying a sleazy sociopath. It was truly a great performance.However, the main problem of this movie was lack of editing. There were way too many scenes in which a point was being made or a mood created-- and this took place in about 20 seconds--a nod to good film making......However, these same scenes then droned on and on for, in some cases, over 5 minutes! We get it--he's making a pep-talk speech to his staff-- we got that in the first 15 seconds. But why continue the same rah-rah pep-talk for a full 5 minutes without adding *anything* new??This was just one example of many scenes that got so stale and I kept thinking--where was the editor? Why didn't he shave a few minutes off these scenes and keep the pace going?So all in all--I felt what could have been a decent movie was just a long, boring slog."
tt0110912,"After watching it am rather underwhelmed with the outcome. This film has zero substance, just a few gangsters talk nonsensically and a few edgy scenes. As I reached the end I thought to myself, what was this film about, it didn't have a satisfying resolution.Wtf was Bruce Willis' storyline, take him out man, he didn't need to be there. It would've just been better to expand on Vincent and Jules' storyline and make their story complete.That being said, I was never bored throughout the film and I couldn't stop watching it, each scene was entertaining even if it I did want to look away at certain points!"
tt0120737,"I guess I just don't get the facination with this movie.  I found it to be far to long, goofy, and boring to stay awake.  I actually dozed off for a bit after struggling to stay awake for the middle hour.  I haven't fallen asleep during a movie since the Robin William's disaster 'Toys.'I was told before the movie that this was one of the greatest movies ever made.  The Academy Award nominations further prompted my belief that this movie would be exceptional.  I must have been expecting much more than I got. What I expected was to be drawn into this magical, legendary J.R.R. Tolkien universe for 3 plus hours.  I had heard of the great special effects, scenery, and characters.  I prepared myself to be amazed.What a dissapointment.  The characters, with the exception of Bilbo Baggins, were all one dimensional and boring.  I found myself unaffected when they were in peril, since I could care less if one of them were to get offed by an inept Ork.  The Orks were scary looking, but when you consider that there were probably 300 of them and they couldn't defeat the 9 in the fellowship, their bark is obviously worse than their bite.  They are as inept as a Star Wars Stormtrooper. The scenery did live up to the hype, but I think it is pretty bad when you consider the surroundings and not the story as the high point of the movie. Special effects?  Maybe I'm a spoiled 'Star Wars' junkie used to the Industrial Light and Magic standard that has been set.  I saw nothing special in the special effects but the fireworks at the beginning of the movie.While it may sound like I hated this movie, I didn't at all.  It was an entertaining film, but I expected much more.  I held this film to a very high standard based on the reviews and feedback from my peers.  I don't know how this film cracked the IMDB's top 10 let alone the top 250.  This wasn't even close to the best movie I've seen this month.  But I will end up with the DVD as my wife loved the film.  I will watch it when I need help falling asleep."
tt0167260,"Man, and you thought Titanic was cheesy?! When I first saw this film on the big screen, the multiple endings bothered me only a little. Now that I saw it for the second time, they simply outraged me. Best adapted screenplay, best director and best picture of the year all went this way. This time: not deserved. The Return of the King ends five times. FIVE TIMES!! I don't give a good goddamn if it was that way in the books too. I never read them. And that gives me a good position to rate this as a film and not a screen adaptation.Every single time Elijah Wood laughs in this movie (in the entire trilogy actually), I almost throw up. Couldn't they make it any more cheesier?! Especially stomach turning is the scene at the end of the RotK, where they all laugh and hug by Frodo's bed. OF COURSE in slow motion to add a little more sappiness. Plus the scene where their journey has ended and they all sit in the pub and sk√•l their pints together.. check out the expression on Wood's face. So cheesy I laughed my a** off.The most worrying thing about all of this is that without the cheesiness and the multiple endings, this would've really been a great movie. I don't love them, but I do like these films. And it was such a tasteless display of drama from the academy to pretty much dismiss the two previous movies and award the last and most tasteless one in spades. It made the whole thing feel like the ""Russell Crowe-syndrome"", as I like to call it. They didn't award him the statue for The Insider, but instead for Gladiator the next year, because they probably felt so guilty. Maximus after all was clearly a more easier role than Wigand and didn't deserve the award as much.I can see why so many love this film and embrace it, but people, eleven Oscars? No.** / *****"
tt0172495,"I came into this movie hearing rave reviews about it, but afterwards, I must say I was rather disappointed. To be fair, the CGI shots of the crowds at The Colluseum were gorgeous, and the fight scenes were top notch. However Gladiator was missing something that other historical epics had, and that was emotion. In Spartacus, we see the horrible conditions that Spartacus and the slaves lived in, and we rooted for them to fight for their freedom. In Braveheart, the film spends a great deal of time developing the romance between Wallace and his wife, and when she's killed by the English, there is a greater emotional response when Wallace fights the English. There was none of that in Gladiator. Although, we see Maximus' wife and son murdered, I felt nothing, since practically no time time was spent fleshing out their relationship. And also Maximus' goal is to overthrow Commodus as emperor and bring control of the Roman Empire to the Senate. I don't know about you, but government restructuring pales in comparison to trying to topple a kingdom. By the time the movie ended, I really didn't care who won or lost. I give Gladiator a 5/10 (5 is for the special effects.)"
tt0137523,"""Fight Club"" an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece. Taking the ""Choose life,"" anti-consumerism rant at the beginning of ""Trainspotting,"" and carrying it to its logical -- albeit extreme -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film that takes a lot of risks by biting the hand that feeds it. The film's narrator (Edward Norton) is an insignificant cog in the drab, corporate machine, dutifully doing his job and what he's told without question. He's an insomniac slave to his IKEA possessions and only finds joy in going to as many self-help/dealing with terminal diseases sessions as he can. It provides him with an escape from his sleepless nights. That is, until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a trashy chain-smoking poser, enters his life and upsets his routine. The narrator also meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic soap salesman whose straightforward honesty, candor and sleazy lounge-lizard outfits are a breath of fresh air. One night, after the two men have bonded over beers, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. At first, it seems like an absurd request but after they pound on each other for a bit, a strange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind of release and satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. In a world where people are desensitized to everything around them, the physical contact of fighting wakes them up and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in and pretty soon Fight Club becomes an underground sensation. However, it becomes readily apparent that Tyler has more elaborate plans than just organizing brawls at the local bar. David Fincher has taken the dark, pessimistic worldview of ""Seven"" and married it with the clever plot twists and turns of ""The Game"" and assembled his strongest effort to date. ""Fight Club"" is a $50+ million studio film that remains true to its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message -- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes ""Fight Club"" a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that completely works. Yet Norton's deadpanned narration holds everything together and allows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening. This is the way films should be made. Why must we always have to go through the A+B+C formula? ""Fight Club"" openly rejects this tired, clearly outdated structure in favour of a stylized frenzy of jump cuts, freeze frames, slow motion and every other film technique in the book that only reinforces its anarchistic message. A film like this would have never been greenlighted by a major studio if Brad Pitt had not been attached to the project. Once you see the film, it becomes obvious that he was the only choice for Tyler Durden. Like he did with ""Kalifornia"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"", Pitt grunges himself down and disappears completely into his role to a frighteningly convincing degree. During many of the brutal fight scenes, he is transformed into a bloody, pulpy mess that'll surely have the ""Legends of the Fall"" fans running for the exits. It is an incredible performance -- probably his best -- for the simple fact that he becomes the character so completely. If Pitt has the flashy, gonzo role, Edward Norton is his perfect foil as the seemingly meek yet sardonic narrator. It's a deceptively understated performance as the last third of the film reveals but Norton nails it perfectly. He is clearly our surrogate, our introduction into this strange world and his wry observations on our consumer-obsessed culture are right on the money. They are the perfect setup for Tyler's introduction and his view on the world which is clearly a call to arms of sorts, a manifesto that rejects the notion that we are what we own. And ultimately, that is what ""Fight Club"" tries to do. The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, ""win."" I think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that down, reject corporate monsters like Starbucks and Blockbuster, and try to figure out what we really want out of life. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation through self-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas that makes ""Fight Club"" a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens."
tt1853728,"""Django"" is part of a story that starts out as a journey, that is both storyline heavy and cinematically appealing and but at the 2/3 mark of the film, ""Unchained"" plays out and the crash and burn effect takes over. That is also the point in the film where Christopher Waltz goes out of character. Coincidence? I think not, but despite my lack of adoration here, there are scenes that can't missed. The pre-KKK attack is a rewrite short of Blazing Saddles and every Waltz soliloquy or explanation of action bears witnessing at least twice. A Tarentino adventure always merits attention, but expectations here are planned resentments of either unfulfilled promise or, more likely, excessive non-sense. Over exposed violence served its purpose in ""Kill Bill"" and ""Inglorious Basterds"" but anti-slavery points were well made and preserved well before the blood sport took over."
tt0139414,"Not to take seriously. Sit back and have fun. A thirty foot alligator is raising havoc in a lake in Maine. Bill Pullman is a park ranger and Bridget Fonda is a museum curator, who try to help the local sheriff contain or kill the gator. Seeing a man bit in half is nothing compared to seeing a grizzly bear and a cow consumed by the toothy menace. Pullman plays his part by the numbers. Fonda plays a very irritating character. Betty White is funny and comes up with a few foul mouthed comments that lightens the movie. The best acting and best lines went to Oliver Platt, playing Hector, who is a rich snob that goes around the world just to swim with alligators. Adam Arkin also has a very small role. The few special effects were too few to make a real scary show. Stay calm and laugh at will."
tt7286456,"This movie shows the true origin of the joker that has never seen before in cinema. I went in expecting non-stop action. But I was wrong, it is more subtle and takes important aspects from the source material. JP's acting is incredible and the trans-formation from Arthur to the Joker is portrayed remarkably well. The laugh he makes added with a great selection of sound and style of the movie makes it that much creepier. You sort of feel sympathy for Arthur and what he's been through even though, he is committing terrible acts of violence. There is elements of dark comedy which blends well with his character. The plot is strong and the director has done a very good job. This stand-alone movie pays great tribute to previous installents and will be go down as one of the best DC movies ever made."
tt0644163,"I loved this show, I liked houston's much better than magnum. He was also more sexier, and I think horsey did a lot of his own stunts. He was also good in Nero Wolfe."
tt0139414,"For a horror movie, surprisingly few fatalities and hardly any gore.  Filled out by a lukewarm cast, led by a bland Bill Pullman.  Only 2 semi-redeemable factors:1.  The sight of a former Golden Girl cursing out some disrespectful youngins; and2.  Fonda is cute."
tt1130884,"Picture the scene. A packed cinema audience in silence waiting for the telling moment when all this makes sense. Then the screen goes black, the credits roll and the house lights come on. The audience sits there for a full 10 seconds (a long time if you try it) while looking around at each other saying ""is that it?"" Now I may not have worked hard enough to understand the film and that may be a failing on my part having been brought up on Die Hardesque action films that don't require much thought, but Shutter Island had me scratching my head for a good few hours after the end. The film starts well. The first 40 minutes or so set the scene tremendously well, introduce the characters, draw you into the despair of a mental hospital and prepare you for a Hitchcock type nerve jangler for the remaining hour and a half or so....But I'm afraid that nerve jangling didn't quite appear. There was nothing in the rest of the film that made me sit up and go ""ooh!"" or ""yikes!"" or even ""gosh"". There were no explosive scares. When you suspected there was going to be one, the character on screen started talking just before the 'moment' so it damped it down a bit. Actually, the lady behind me dropped her bottle of juice at one point which scared the bejeezuz out of the whole audience more than this film! There are too many unanswered questions in this film. Too many key moments that never get answered when you get to the end and not enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. Critics loved it, movie execs too. But really, the film industry is about getting guys like me and my mates to spend a few hours and ten quid once a week to come and watch your work. If this is anything to go by then Mr Scorcese won't be getting my tenner again. If you love getting your pants scared off and throwing your popcorn about in panic then don't bother, if you like an adrenaline fuelled ride through the city streets with copters and rockets keep away, but if you love analytical thrillers and making up your own theories to explain film endings you'll love it. just don't try and explain it to me if we meet."
tt0468569,"""The Dark Knight"" is a movie that honors its title. Dark, twisted and complex, Christopher Nolan's latest wonder concerning Batman is a movie that sets a before and after in its genre and joins its perfect companion; its predecessor ""Batman Begins"". It had been a long time since I had seen so much adrenaline on a screen, but then again Nolan's Batman is what it is because it isn't just about the adrenaline.It's still daylight in Gotham when a masterful opening sequence (supported by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer-again-magical score) gives way for a robbery to take place; organized by a man who calls himself The Joker (Heath Ledger), someone we would instantly take as a villain. If normally villains don't call themselves villains in superhero movies, this one says a lot of things about himself. He loves to talk and share his life philosophy with everyone he meets; he likes to joke, of course; he likes to watch people suffer with or without him watching; he dislikes rules and he likes Batman.This last statement maybe more understood once you've watched the film, but there's one of Bruce Wayne (yes, Christian Bale IS Batman) many interesting conversations with Alfred (Michael Caine) in which they discuss the nature of The Joker, and the old man points out that maybe Bruce doesn't understand this villain in particular. There will be a moment of confrontation later in which the villain will tell the superhero: ""You complete me"". That phrase reminded me of the great movie ""Unbreakable"" is.But, actually, what is a hero and what is a villain? In Nolan's brilliant screenplay (written with his brother Jonathan, a usual collaborator), full of psychological insight, this is one of the issues that floats over our head as we get lost in the ever exciting action sequences, fights and things blowing up in Nathan Crowley's spectacular production design.""It's not what underlies you, but what you do that defines you"", a Rachel Dawes now played truthfully by Maggie Gyllenhaal told Bruce in ""Batman Begins"". Her words resonate, as Batman continues to fight evil with her, Gordon (Gary Oldman) and a new ally, the D.A. Harvey Dent (a superb Aaron Eckhart).Let's not forget that Batman is more human than any of the other superheroes of the comic books. In this film, he's never able to call himself a hero and he thinks of quitting; without knowing if he's the guardian the city needs or deserves. But in all this realness, to continue watching him fall, to see him using his gadgets and his vehicles as a pro, to see that intelligence may surpass a gun to win a little fight or to generate fire without the need of any explosive; is one of ""The Dark Knight's"" treats to the viewer.Another major treat for the viewer is the presence of a villain (or criminal, if you prefer, as The Joker refers to himself when he says the town ""deserves a better kind of criminal""-again the issue of deserving someone or not; a villain or a hero-) that equals Batman in human qualities. I don't mean that The Joker has principles we may admire (although many people will find inspiring things in his weirdness), I'm simply referring to the fact that he doesn't fly through the air or owns magic powers and he just uses what he has in hand to serve some kind of purpose.Heath Ledger steals the film (and will get an Oscar nomination, because dreaming has no cost) and makes a wonderful Joker, mainly, because he embraces this human aspect of the character Christian Bale understood so well in ""Batman Begins"". Without overacting, Ledger creates an individual that we can call a freak, because it's the first thing that crosses our mind when we meet him. He has all this makeup in his face and two scars; he has a lot of stories to explain the origin of these scars. Ledger tells every story convincingly, and leaves no room for the viewer to fully understand him. His character has no name, nor he possesses the background story we see many times with heroes and villains; however we get to perceive an amount of grimness in his look and we want to know exactly where it comes from. It's Heath Ledger's great acting what generates all this.The rest of the ensemble, as in ""Batman Begins"", is top-notch. Michael Caine is given more screen time and makes the best of it; so does the great Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman. There are surely many other perspectives in which the film can be viewed and discussed, and that reflects the very good piece Nolan has created; a movie that's profound in the best sense of the word¬ÖA word we don't use so much for comic book movies.Anyway¬ÖBatman may not know if he's the protector Gotham needs or deserves, but ""The Dark Knight"" is undoubtedly the superhero movie the film-goer deserves and has been waiting for since its predecessor; a film that even someone who knows nothing about comics, like me, celebrates with a big smile¬ÖWhy so serious?"
tt0110912,"It resonated so deeply on a level I couldn't explain at the time. Possibly it was the non-linear timeline of the plot, maybe it was the less-than-desirable content of the plot told in such an approachable way, maybe it was the easily memorable phrases and script or maybe it was the meticulously selected soundtrack that sourced from a host of decades and genresI think this was the first time I watched a movie that was so non linear. I think everything I had watched before this went from A to B with possibly a flashback explaining something. This changed everything!! After this we had great movies like The Usual Suspects and Monento. But it is not just the structure to Pulp Fiction that makes it great, it does not put a foot wrong."
tt1130884,"Like any fan of Scorsese, I was very excited to see this film, but left disappointed. The build up of the story was fantastic: Hurricane season. Deary and moody. Epic shots of this huge, foreboding island. Haunting score that puts your senses on alert. Ominous mental asylum. Everything hinted at an instant classic thriller; another Scorsese masterpiece. With the 1950s setting, the U.S. Marshals/detectives, missing person case and the bleak tone the film was establishing, there was even a noir feel to it.As the story progresses, the protagonist (DiCaprio) starts having these off-kilter flashbacks, and among one of them, a story that tells of his time in the Second World War. This is where I think the film hits its highest note. How all these different flashbacks fit into this puzzle that is this mental asylum, Shutter Island, is the mystery you're anxiously waiting to be unraveled. If your history is up to par then you'll know how fitting the WWII plot element is to the overall story of the film, which is also ultimately where I think the movie left me underwhelmed. I understand this film is based off of a novel, a set script, but I wish Scorsese would've explored more of the aforementioned plot element and done away with the tired, clich√© story that eventually unfolds.To the film's credit, the cinematography, score, set design, wardrobe and the often forgotten, lighting (very creepy and effective at times), were all marvelously done. DiCaprio, who I'm not a big fan of, was actually quite enjoyable and solid. Often times he doesn't seem to really fit the bill of the role, but in Shutter Island I was a believer. DiCaprio's character was very ""alive"" to me. The acting by the rest of the supporting cast were top notch as well. Mark Ruffalo, who I think is a very underrated actor, was a nice surprise as I didn't know he was going to be in this film.Overall, 6 stars or a B-. Worth the watch but not something I would eventually buy on DVD."
tt0108052,"There are a lot of negative reviews on here... Most of those focus on the fact that Nazis weren't as bad as how they depict them. I suppose that's a matter of opinion. And, as we know, opinions are like assholes, everyone's got one. Honestly, the fact that they exterminated so many people (and not just Jews) because they felt them to be ""inferior"" doesn't make Nazis all sunshine and rainbows. Were they an efficient society? Yes. Did that make them superior to people of other faiths or races? No. No matter how you look at it, everyone has their own definition of good and evil and levels thereof. It all depends on your point of view. And how Spielberg views exactly how evil he felt the Nazis were should not be the sole basis of a movie review. My apologies to those who think otherwise. Now, as for the movie itself, it is a bit dark and depressing. But then again, the real life events weren't like a Club Med vacation. If you know anything about this particular period of time, you shouldn't expect cheerful. If that's what you want, go watch something else. My son watched this in history class in high school (I had to sign a permission slip because of the nudity and content). When he saw it was on one of the movie channels a year later, he told me I should watch it, that it was such a good movie. Now... my kid loves video games and Pokemon. That's pretty much it. He hates to read and hates historical anything. So when he said it was good and I should watch it, I knew I had to see it. I must admit, I was engrossed from the beginning. I had never heard of Oskar Schindler before this movie (when I was in high school, they didn't delve much into WWII) and I found his story fascinating. He risked a lot to save the lives of a lot of people. Whether or not he profited from this financially or not is kind of irrelevant. What's most important is that he wanted to save lives when the rest of the Nazis wanted to kill them all off. And the very fact that these people, who are shown at the end honoring his grave, shows me they held him in high regard, which I found moving. And I'm not easily moved. From an artist aspect, I think this was very well done. The use of black and white was quite appropriate for the content and also allowed for the few splashes of color to help the viewer focus on something important you may not have noticed otherwise, like the little girl in the red coat. As for people who complained about Spielberg... You may not think this his best movie or some sappy piece of fluff he cranked out. For those who felt that way, I'd like to ask that you go read some of the trivia items. He doesn't get a dime from this movie. He wants everything he could get donated. Mind you, he could have just donated a chunk of money, but this was obviously something he felt strongly about. I consider that to be more than admirable."
tt0993846,"People for whom money matters please don't watch this in theatre. Please read the negative reviews by others. They are writing the truth.Movie is extremely brash, audacious and full of ......Some urinating scenes, number of times Di Caprio or some others use the expletives like M***** F****** or any other equally horrible expletives is unbelievable. And number of times he keeps shouting is equally horrible and disgusting. Is shouting justified as acting? Di Caprio's last best film is Inception.I hope people who didn't watch will take the negative reviews seriously. Some might have a good laugh and enjoy the movie but please ask yourself. Do you really want to pay for this kind of movie? Remember you are paying your hard earned money not like they earn in the movie. I spent my time on this movie but not my money. Please make a wise decision. Watch it on TV/computer/other device. Please don't get fooled."
tt0361748,So I balanced it out. This review is too short but its too the point. Watch it. Judge it yourself.
tt0120815,This film is an absolute masterpiece. It shows that war isn't always glamorous. Steven Spielberg won a Best Directing Oscar for his work on this film and the film went on to win four others. It is gritty and bloody and it shows that wars aren't won by weapons but by soldiers. The cast shine as the group of soldiers tasked with finding Private Ryan. Along the way they encounter the harsh truth and real meaning of war. It boasts impressive battle sequences and the stylish cinematography makes the film truly beautiful. The opening beach sequence is possibly the greatest opening scenes in movies. Tom Hanks is spell binding as the commander who has no idea about the harsh truth of war. Overall a truly amazing film.
tt0102926,Story is very bad ....the story has no sense there are very boring and very dull moments in film lack of character development
tt0068646,"I'm not a fan of this type of movies, but since I like Al Pacino and I've heard so much about this so-called ""legendary"" Godfather, I decided to give it a try. I must say this is the most inexplicably overrated piece of trash I've ever seen. The characters are all ridiculous, unsympathetic and under developed, the story drags and lacks any real conflict and dynamicsBut the most disgusting aspect is the movie's intent to glorify a bunch of low-life criminals and turn them into larger-than-life figures, into some kind of royalty. This whole ""family"" tradition is just ludicrous. We're supposed to ""care"" about these characters, to think that they are ""cool"". The major problem here is that there's no real conflict. There's no redeeming value whatsoever, they're all despicable and one-dimensional, so why the hell would I care.The violence (which is particularly sickening) is another issue, but I guess audiences have come to appreciate it, and it's now a ""hallmark"" of the genre. Imagine, the Godfather's pregnant daughter gets beaten with a belt. But guess what: she's not likable either! She's hysterical, obnoxious and, even worse, she keeps defending her abusive husband. In another scene, James Caan beats the hell out of someone in front of children. Marvelous! That's just great, not to mention cool and ""culturally relevant"".Marlon Brando speaking with a husky voice and cotton in his mouth is incredibly ridiculous. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone suddenly turns, from a principled man who doesn't want to have anything to do with murder, into a ruthless criminal. What? This character has no depth, no consistency whatsoever. His relationships with women are so poorly portrayed, they add nothing to his development. It's Pacino's worst, I can't imagine why anyone would think this is a great performance. If you want to see a good gangster movie, go watch ""Donnie Brasco"" instead."
tt0108052,"Why are people behaving rude when writing reviews? I'm not a jew or from Poland but i lived in Poland few years and it's the totally same what i saw in there and in this movie. in my opinion you people should be bit more humble!
They made an effort to make this movie and it's a nice movie !!"
tt1130884,"I had seen parts of a trailer for this film and was in two minds about seeing it but I like psychological thrillers with unpredictable plot twists so I went to see it.Unfortunately it was very predictable, approximately 10-20 minutes into the film anyone with average or greater intelligence will in all probability immediately spot what the plot twist is going to be. I only watched the rest of the film in the hope that I was wrong and that it was a double bluff and I was going to cheer in amazement but sadly I was disappointed, the movie played out as expected, waste of 2 hours.I can't say the film was truly awful but it didn't make the grade as a psych thriller, I found the music as they entered the island to be very jarring as well, but thats just a personal preference. Also I found the overuse of ""certain imagery"" to be unnecessary.I would wait for DVD if at all, but there are much better psych thrillers out there."
tt0120815,"I went to see this film back in 1998 with my father, who is a WWII veteran who happened to serve in the Pacific Theatre, on Iwo Jima. While on line, he struck up a conversation with another veteran who did happen to serve in the European Theatre, and they discussed old times. But near the end of the conversation, my dad said, ""For what? For what?"" Something that still resonates with many WWII vets who are still alive, and saw that war was not the prettified heroics pumped out of the Hollywood studios, but a very real, bloody and bewildering hell, fought by the young and vital, male and female alike.The premise of the film being a young man who has already lost several brothers in the service, being saved by a platoon unknown to him has its basis in fact. During the Second World War, many families had several sons who either enlisted, or were drafted, and went into different military units. The five Sullivan brothers, all of whom were lost during the sinking of the USS Juneau, were the most famously representative of this tragedy, and after the war, the practice of multiple draft recipients from one family was eliminated. Does anyone remember the scene where Private Ryan's mother sees an Army car pulling up to her porch? The serviceman and her local clergyman approach her, and she sinks down, struck by the horrible reality they are about to convey. The terrible simplicity of this is deeply moving.There is also a brief scene in the beginning showing a secretarial pool for the Armed Services, where letters for medals, both posthumous and for the living, were typed and sent to families around the country. My mother worked in one of those pools, and it was not an easy job to deal with day by day.Some have asked - why no British soldiers here? This is an American platoon on the Omaha beachhead, not one of Montgomery's units. The daily dangers and horrors of war are vividly portrayed. The deaths aren't pretty, and some of the characters aren't pretty, but that's the way war is (and was). You were in a unit with all types, from different states, and your common goal was to survive - kill, or be killed. There were gloryboys and cowards, and some are shown here.The only maudlin note (and Spielberg can't seem to resist injecting some sentimentality here) is when the mature Ryan, visiting the military cemetery with his family, stops at the grave of his commanding officer John Miller, and asks in tears, ""Am I a good man?"" In other words - why them, and not me? Why am I here, outliving everyone? It doesn't seem justified to him.There are some terrific performances to take in : Tom Hanks as John Miller, Matt Damon as Pvt. Ryan, Tom Sizemore, and Vin Diesel, to name just a few.The sacrifices of our fathers, uncles, and grandfathers' generation were exemplary. They were the lucky ones who came back to lend their voices to history, and without them, many of us, including myself, would not be here. At the end of the film, I sat there, next to my dad, who was also in tears. I would say, ""God bless them, one and all."""
tt0372784,"Batman Begins isn't another superhero movie in the line of Spider- Man, the X- Men or the Hulk. In fact, even if you don't care for Batman or any of his costumed colleagues, you can still enjoy this film as a good action- thriller. It doesn't thrive on special effects and big action scenes but offers a decent story with lots of attention to character development. The movie is fairly low tech and because it doesn't rely on computer technology in the way other recent superhero movies do, it has an old school feel to it, kind of like an early 80s fantastic film or even Superman: The Movie. Of course, Batman Begins is much darker than Richard Donner's beauty, but the evolution of both main characters from youths, coming to terms with who they are, to caped crusaders is depicted in a similar way. As far as the actual crime fighting goes, this movie puts right everything that was done wrong in Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Our hero's weapons are not covered with blinking lights, but sober and practical: no computer controlled Batarangs, but ninja stars shaped as a bat. No design costume, but military armor, decorated with a cape and mask. The Batmobile is no skyscraper climbing super car, but a rejected army vehicle put to new use that befits the general atmosphere of this movie. Batman doesn't fight villains in shiny outfits who fly around on supersonic gliders or have tentacles as arms. The bad guys in this film are real people: gangsters, a corrupt warden of a psychiatric ward, a martial arts specialist and lots of crooked cops. If you take into consideration that Batman Begins is based on the Year One comics, written by Sin City's Frank Miller, one cannot help noticing the similarity between Robert Rodriguez' newly created world and the one depicted in this movie. In fact, Sin City could just as well be Gotham City without Batman. So forget Joel Schumacher's monstrosities. In fact, Christopher Nolan has even gone one better than Tim Burton and created a credible movie with a good story, realistic characters and the filthiest setting the world's Darkest Knight has ever called home."
tt0102926,"I've always wanted to see Silence of the Lambs and finally got to today. I thought that Hannibal Lector sounded like a really cool character and of course I anticipated excellent film-making with the sort of praise it has received.I saw it, and I would say that as far as movies like this go, it is excellent. But for cinema in general, Silence is unremarkable and, really, given the hype and awards, ultimately disappointing.Jodie Foster was good, but she is haunted by the slaughter of a lamb from her childhood? Ridiculous. Anthony Hopkins was great. I think he deserved his award, though his performance is overrated. Not exactly a very complex or hard to portray character...The story was not particularly exciting. It was fairly clumsy and failed to capture my attention. I was repelled by Buffalo Bill but not interested in his character whatsoever. I watched the movie for the rare encounters with Hannibal Lector, and the search for Buffalo Bill was an uninteresting but necessary backdrop. Also, how on Earth would the FBI bring a SWAT team to a house that is a false tip, that is hundreds of miles away from the killings...? It makes no sense - they completely ignored the evidence and conclusions they had already made. And so, when the so-called thrilling doorbell scene took place, I was not surprised. Of course he's not in Chicago. Ridiculous.I can honestly say I enjoyed Lector's escape. It was clever and suspenseful (if a bit illogical) and to some degree makes the movie.And is this movie scary, as has been said? No. Definitely not. The serial killer is creepy, not terrifying. Hannibal is intriguing, but not too scary. I've heard of people not sleeping for days, others having horrific nightmares... I don't understand it.This movie is worth watching if you like thrillers/serial killer/ kind of movies, but if you go into this film expecting a great piece of cinema, some groundbreaking technique or idea, or a thrilling scene or two as I did, you will be disappointed. A good movie, yes. 23rd on IMDb Top 250? Absolutely not. An 8.7 on IMDb? No."
tt0167261,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Starring: Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, Viggo Mortensen, Brad Dourif, Sean Astin Rating: PG-13 Runtime: 2:59There are two types of people who will watch this movie: Those who read the books and wand to see the visions brought to life, and those who saw the first movie in the trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring) but haven't read the books (and perhaps don't plan to do so).The latter group will be more receptive to The Two Towers than the former, because director Peter Jackson takes some major liberties with the plot. As most people are aware, there are three books (The Return of the King is the final in the trilogy). There are scenes in the second book that will appear in the third movie, and vice versa. This is perfectly reasonable, in my opinion, as it would be difficult - and perhaps not nearly as entertaining - to present the movies in exactly the same order as the books.That said, there are some major plot deviations in The Two Towers, scenes and situations that appear in none of the books. If one has read the books, this can be quite disconcerting, as one might be expecting the movie to follow the basic plot of either The Two Towers book or The Return of the King book. If one hasn't read the books (but did see the first film in the trilogy), this might not be so disconcerting - one might not even notice a problem. So this isn't a complaint, exactly, as much as it's an observation.The movie picks up right where the last one left off. Now, I'm going to assume here that people reading this have seen The Fellowship of the Ring. When that movie concluded, the original Fellowship had lost two (Boromir was slain by orcs after attempting to gain The One Ring, and Gandalf fell into the abyss beneath the mines of Moria), and the remaining seven were separated. Frodo, the Ringbearer, and his servant Sam have decided to continue their quest alone and are making their way to Mordor. Their fellow Hobbits Merry and Pippin have been kidnapped by those orcs that had slain Boromir; the orcs are under orders to capture alive any Halfling, since they don't know which one has The One Ring. Aragorn the Ranger, Gimli the Dwarf, and Leglolas the Elf are now tracking the horde of orcs, hoping to rescue Merry and Pippin.The first movie clearly belonged to Frodo, who unlike most of his companions is slight, timid but fun-loving, hardly the hardy adventurer. He alone is entrusted to carry the eminently corrupting Ring to its demise in Mount Doom. But the second movie shifts focus to another character, one who was seen only very briefly in the first movie: Gollum. Gollum has a long history with the Ring, and he's now a complete slave to it. He wants it, his Precious, back in his possession. He joins up with Frodo and Sam to lead them to the Black Gate, the terrible entrance to Mordor itself, home of Sauron, the maker of the Ring (who desperately wants it back). Gollum likes Frodo, but he's plagued by split personalities; one side of him wants to help the Hobbits, the other side wants to kill them and eat them - and regain The Ring. It's interesting to note that Gollum, unlike the other major characters, is completely computer generated. This isn't all that new in and of itself, but it's Gollum's emotional expressions that make you think he's as real as the actors playing Frodo and Sam. In fact, director Jackson had Andy Serkis (who voices Gollum) act in the scenes with Sam and Frodo, then had him digitally removed and replaced with a computer-generated Gollum. The result is much more seamless than your run-of-the-mill computerized character.But the story's not just about Frodo and his quest. Sauron knows the Ring's out there, and that a Halfling has it, but he has other matters to attend to. His goal is to wipe out mankind forever. That might be tough in today's world, but in Middle-Earth man was just gaining a foothold; elves and the like had ruled for eons. Saruman, as seen in the last movie, has been breeding legions and legions of superfighters, mutant orcs called Uruk-hai. The Uruk-hai are sent to attack the kingdom of Rohan, which has already been attacked from the inside through a silver-tongued advisor to the king, a Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). By casting a spell on the king, Theoden, Wormtongue is able to render him invalid; his kingdom is shortly weakened. Wormtongue is working for Saruman, who's working for Sauron (even though he thinks he's working for himself). In addition, the kingdom of Rohan has been set against that of Gondor, the other remaining Man kingdom. Together, they might be trouble for the Enemy; separate, they can be picked apart.One of the most prolonged scenes in the movie is the battle at Helm's Deep. After being removed from his spell, Theoden takes his people there for shelter and safety, determined to fight, aided by Aragorn, Leglolas, and Gimli. The Uruk-hai, some ten thousand strong, attack. There have been many excellently staged epic battle scenes in cinematic history, but they all seem to pale to the extravagance and sheer power of this one. It's an awe-inspiring scene, guaranteed to make one cheer.Now, as I said, there are some differences between the books and this movie. I don't mind if certain scenes or sequences are left out, because you can only cram so much into a three-hour movie. But when scenes appear in the movie that never appeared in any of the books, I have a problem. These books have been around for a long time, and it just seems foolhardy to add plot that doesn't need to be added, while at the same time omitting plot that seems necessary. I won't go into details here about what ""new"" scenes are in the movie that aren't in the books, but I was scratching my head after a few of them (and I had just reread The Two Towers a month or so ago).There's even less attention paid to female characters this time around. Arwen, the Elvish beauty who had a thing for Aragorn in the first movie, is seen in dream sequences only - although this is indeed an important plot point, as it explains Aragorn's motivations a bit more lucidly. There's a new female character as well: Eowyn, the daughter of the Rohan king, who (surprise, surprise) also has a thing for Aragorn.There are some funny moments as well, most of them involving Gimli the Dwarf, who appears to be along for comic relief - even more so than in Fellowship. This can, however, have the unintended consequence of marginalizing Gimli's character; after all, he's a strong, steadfast, and tough Dwarf, yet he's pigeonholed into a ""comic"" character. The chemistry between him and Leglolas the Elf is excellent, however.One thing that we must all be thankful for is that the movie does shift away from Frodo himself. Elijah Wood continues to prove he's a terrible actor, incapable of expressing emotion adequately. As the story wears on, Frodo is supposed to get weaker and more beaten - although at times he can rouse himself to complete his quest. But Wood always has that scared look, that deer-caught-in-headlights look, the look that says, ""Why am I here with these actors?"" The performance is flat and ineffectual. And although the focus of the movie as a whole does shift away from Frodo, because his scenes basically involve just him, Sam, and Gollum, Wood's inadequacies are that much more accentuated. Luckily, these scenes are dwarfed (pardon the pun) by the battle scenes.It's never easy to make the middle movie in a trilogy - you want to build on the first movie and lead to the third. Remember Back to the Future II? Wasn't quite as charming as the first one or as action-packed as the third one. It was just kind of there. The Two Towers suffers this indignity, to an extent. Unlike the first one, there's no opening narration that gets everyone up to speed, and like the first one, this one just sort of .... ends. And not necessarily in the same manner as the second book did, either.This movie isn't as good as The Fellowsip of the Ring, but it's still very, very good. I'm giving it three-and-a-half stars out of four, but bear in mind it was a tough three and a half to get. It's not as bad as a three-star movie, but it's not quite the masterpiece of the first movie, either."
tt0167260,"The problem with this movie is that there's nothing new going on, its more of the same from the previous 2 movies. This is by far the weakest of the series, the ending was just so corny and predictable. Same old battles, same old Frodo, same old clich√©s, same old everything, this movie had nothing.This whole series could've been 1 movie, instead they just milked it for all that it was worth, and by the time this one came around i'd had more than enough.I don't understand how this movie ranks at number 4 on the top 250 list of all time, it shouldn't be in the top 1000 let alone the top 250. The only words to describe this movie are bloated and self-indulgent."
tt0697783,I like the bit where Elaine buys all the sponges but won't waste one on a dud root
tt0848228,"This movie is the definition of being over-hyped: Hardly any aspect of it has escaped being hailed as among the best of recent years, be it acting, special effects, fighting scenes or plot. In my opinion, it falls far, far short of that benchmark. The visual effects are very good, sure, but then so are the effects in Battleship.The acting isn't bad, but it's hardly impressive either. The few impressive performances are completely overshadowed by the very average writing. Platitudes, one-liners, soundbites and trailer lines are constant. Much of it makes no sense at all: Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is cautious about ""the other one"" and seems to dislike people knowing about it, yet he constantly references this. It's as if the writers thought ""We haven't shown Banner as the Hulk yet; better make him allude to that in his every line so people don't forget.""The largest problem with the movie, without a doubt, is the plot. The bad guy never feels threatening, his plan is extremely inefficient and frankly stupid in many ways, and the plot holes are too many to count. For instance, in one scene we see the Hulk being a mindless beast, destroying everything in his path, but later we see him taking orders. Add to that that the superhero who apparently has the power of super-aim misses whenever the script calls for it making his on-screen superpower ""is really good with a bow and arrow"". In one scene he misses half a dozen shots from a distance of 12 feet.On a related note, what is Captain Americas superpower compared to the others? Patriotism? Other Avengers are superiour in every single way. Ranged combat, close combat, mobility, intelligence, strength... Even his weapon is a worse version of Thors hammer. Not that Black Widow is any better, but at least she has some use in the plot.This movie is like The Expendables, only it takes itself seriously and has better acting. It is thoroughly unimpressive and how it currently has a rank of #57 of all time movies is truly baffling."
tt0167261,"I just watched the DVD wondering if my impressions would change.  They did. What I thought was bad in the theater is now terrible.  This film is dull and choppy, with horrible dialogue and weak acting from the ""regular"" cast. The plot is nonexistant, most of the fighting CGI average at best, and except for the breakthrough of the Gollum character, there is absolutely nothing worthwhile in this mediocre film.  The high rating here is baffling...until you see that there are millions of people who also think ""Attack of the Clones"" is a good film.  Fans will accept the worst if it has the name Lord of the Rings or Star Wars attached to it.  I thought the first film was weak--but the extended edition on DVD was truly beautiful.  I am holding out hope, but I can't imagine that there is going to be a similar ""extended edition"" save here...because this film is truly awful."
tt0133093,"There are few words that describe ""The Matrix,"" but derivative, loud, painful, and disappointing would be a good start. From a plot straight out of a Dick or Gibson novel, to the agony of watching Laurence Fishburne recite pages of truly awful exposition, this is a film that tries really hard, but often misses the mark. To be fair, the film is aiming high and the middle third works really well. The sets, costumes and effects are terrific and the stunts and fight scenes are pretty wild. There are also some nice metaphors playing out, and there is a serious parable being told here. The dialogue during the middle is also sharp and witty, and makes me wonder who wrote the rest of it, particularly all the scenes where Fishburne and Keanu Reeves play Obi Wan and Luke Skywalker. (""The matrix surrounds us, it penetrates us...."" And I thought the next Star Wars movie wasn't coming out until May.) The film can't decide if it wants to be Aliens, Johnny Mnemonic, a Borg episode, a John Woo film, or a Gap ad, so it borrows lots from all of them and ends up being too little of each. Like a lot of sf films lately, there was a really good movie in here struggling to get out. But it never makes it."
tt0110912,"Film is not entertaining at all, just a flop crab. Not sure, what they were trying to show in almost 3 hours wasted watching it. No story line at all, scenes are unnecessarily lengthen just to add time. Unnecessary dialogs and unrelatrd sequences. Unrelated plots. Only reason I watched it was high IMDB rating but I highly regretted my decision. Extremely bad language has been used throughout the film without having additional impact. Contrary to many reviews, comedy and humor including is also very low graded. Actings are just normal.Highly recommended to avoid it and save your precious time."
tt1345836,"Honestly, I don't understand why this movie has so many fantastic reviews. I absolutely loved the 1st two batman movies. But the 3rd one was a complete disappointment. And for my review I am assuming that the first two batman movies were never made. Almost nothing in the movie makes sense. Some people like Ann Hathaway's acting but there's nothing special about it, honestly. It feels like Chis Nolan has paid many of the reviewers here. Tom Hardy is a great actor but doesn't quite fit the character of bane. They should have picked up someone like Undertaker from wwe for Bane (someone at least 7 ft tall). Bane was very difficult to understand. (and I live in an English speaking country). even my wife couldn't understand him but was too embarrassed to admit until I mentioned it lol. The story is just weak. At one point it seems the movie is shot in 2012 but the flashback looks like its going back to 1700's. Miranda's story was just rubbish. At one point she sleeps with batman and 30 mins later she stabs him. Really? Mr Nolan? really? oh did I tell you Bane was killed by Celina Kyle (i.e ann Hathaway) and she did it quite easily with that Bat-bike (or whatever you call it). why didn't they just do it before. Guys please stop giving positive reviews just because this is batman. the movie is rubbish, in every way. I didn't review the dark knight(I,e batman 2) on IMDb but I have to say it was brilliant. oh the joker - that was top class acting by Heath Ledger."
tt0167260,"This is the final movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and certainly doesn't disappoint like some other trilogies *coughMatrixcough*. The three films had their principal shooting all done at the same time, which lowers their overall costs and keeps a good sense of continuity for the films.The special effects, first of all, are excellent. While there's a few little things (a reversed shot with smoke flowing back into chimneys and occasional lighting that's a bit off), by and large they're excellent. The most impressive thing about them is the sheer scale. This isn't a small or simple scene; it often includes thousands of digital characters combined with filmed actors and action, sweeping landscapes, and dozens of things happening at once. This is a good reason to see it in theatres; even on DVD, there's little details that you can only catch when it's on a massive screen.The filming is good, although there are a few evidences of digital smoothing and cutting that can nag at the mind and eyes of a picky movie-goer. There are a few interesting shots, but most are fairly plain and straight on, getting the point across without being dazzling. New Zealand's landscapes provide a great backdrop for everything going on, and there really are some beautiful places, especially up in the mountains. I hear land prices are quite good, what with the orcs warring and everything, so you may want to look into real estate purchases now.Sound has been said to make 75% of the emotional impact of any production. This is a loud 75%. All the sound effects are very well pulled off, sound appropriate, and are generally loud. The Nazgul screeching was bordering on painful, but in a good way. Most everything has a distinct sound, and it's rare that anything feels out of place. In some of the battles, the roof of the theatre was shaking. The soundtrack fits the movie well, and Howard Shore has done an excellent job, as with the last two films in the series.Performances all around were good, but Sean Astin as Sam and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn really dominated the film. They performed their roles perfectly, and came away giving a good picture of the characters. Elijah Wood seemed to be stuck with the same terrified expression on his face through most of the movie, almost Max Payne-style, and it grew old quickly. Ian McKellen, the ever-wise white wizard, had a fair bit of dialogue which he delivered well; my only complaint is he had too much in the way of wistful sayings leading to scene changes. Orlando Bloom, favorite of young teenage girls everywhere, had a few more action sequences (which got cheers from the aforementioned girls) which were quite well pulled off, but his acting wasn't much tested by this film. John Rhys-Davies continued with Gimli's joking performance; he's really too amusing to take seriously, but does a good job at it.For the old Tolkien fans, this movie stays quite close to the book, although they did have to omit some portions, most notably the taking and retaking of the Shire and the time spent in the Halls of Healing in Minas Tirith. Hopefully some of this will show up in the Extended Edition on DVD. Shelob's attack was left until this film, and much of the time spent in Mordor was shortened for the sake of pacing, and it was a good decision.My favorite scene would have to be the battle at Minas Tirith. The incredible scope of the battle, with the special effects, sounds, and many close-ups of pieces of the action, make for an exciting scene. The visual effects especially are stunning; the 'oliphaunts' play a big part in the action, and they're entirely created by computer. There's also some wide shots with tens of thousands of digital characters marching on the field of battle, and even the individual actions have the masses warring as a backdrop. It's worth your movie-going dollar simply to watch this on a large screen. It was also intermingled with some smaller events inside Minas Tirith, so it's not pure battle for the whole of the scene, and it keeps it from being dreary or heavy-handed.Overall, this is a movie well worth watching, and even paying to see in a theatre. I'd recommend against bringing small children, as there are some scary images, and they'd also be a distraction during the final movie in what will probably remain the series of the decade. Not a particularly great date movie, either...this is a real, bring-your-friends big movie. Five out of five decapitated orcs (and trust me, there were a lot more than that)."
tt0109830,"""Forrest Gump"" failed to ""grab"" me from the outset. I kept wondering throughout what was its point: are we to float through life like a feather, barely being able to comprehend its meaning? Nothing which transpired did I find uplifting or involving. Indeed, it was one of the longest, most tedious journeys I've taken in a film.  Its merits to me are its technology, and not much more."
tt0167260,The greatest tragedy of the human race is that they will never make a better movie than Return of the King.
tt0102926,"Very well directed with a heavy and ominous tone that shadows the entire movie. The sound and editing all function in creating and maintaining the film's eerie atmosphere. Reviewing this film, how could one not mention Anthony Hopkins chilling and creepy performance as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. He portrays, without a doubt, one of the best psychotic characters in cinema history. He's so good that at one point, you may start to, dare I say, root for him? The chemistry between Hopkins and Jodie Foster's character is brilliant and the dialogue between them is masterfully crafted. Once you let Hannibal into your mind, you can never get him out. After watching The Silence of the Lambs, I don't think I can ever forget it. Are you up for the challenge?"
tt0137523,I can't believe how many people actually like this film....... I can't believe how looooooonnnnngggggg and boooooooooring it was. It was the strangest and weirdest film I'd ever seen. Everything that happened in this film would never happen in real life ever. Even the ending was the worse ending to a film. I'm speaking from a girls point of view tho ... Girls it is rubbbbbishhhh. It's more of a mans wishful way of thinking. This film I'd say was probably brad Pitts worse films he has done. A good film he was in was SNATCH. I'd recommend that film over this anyday. A film this long should be capturvating . I was waiting for it to get better then the ending come and I thought I can't believe I just sat here and watched it. Very strange very weird and would never happen !!
tt0268200,"First and foremost, Brigham City is a murder mystery.  But it's also a story about how a murder can make victims of everyone who lives in a small town that is supposed to be safe.While Brigham City is set in a predominantly Mormon town in Utah, but it could just have easily been any small town in America and the people could have been of any faith (or none at all).  The people of the town feel safe and secure.  No one locks they're doors.  Everyone knows everyone else. Then their sense of security is shattered by a spree of vicious murders. Suddenly everyone is on his guard and quick to distrust those they have trusted for years.The plot of Brigham City really has the feel of a traditional Hollywood thriller, the addition of Mormon culture give the film a higher level of depth.  While the film is about Mormons and provides some brief glimpses into their beliefs and customs, it does not attempt to convert audience members to the LDS church.In his second film, Richard Dutcher does an admirable job of bringing this story to the big screen.  The film feels more professional and polished than his previous entry (God's Army), but at the same time doesn't feel like the typical Hollywood fare.What works in this movie is Dutcher's attention to detail and the depth of the characters.  I was pleased to see how the violence in the movie was implied rather than shown directly.  I was also impressed by the casting of Wilford Brimley.  There may have been a commercial reason for him being attached to the film, but his presence gave the film a feeling of familiarity.Dutcher also makes great use of camera angles and music to cast each person as a suspect.  This is also the film's low point, as it is used so much it begins to bog down the story.  Non-Mormons may feel that certain points of the movie are a bit too preachy.All in all, Brigham City is a decent movie.  I don't recommend it for younger children, as some of the implied violence may be disturbing, but most people over 13 will probably be drawn into the story the same way you would a traditional Hollywood thriller.You might ask why I (a non-Mormon) interested in seeing Brigham City.  Since I manage the movie theater where the film is playing I wanted to be able to give an informed opinion about the movie.  As a movie fan, I was interested to see how Brigham City stood up to other Hollywood and independent films. As a person, I was interested for the glimpse of Mormon culture the film provided."
tt1853728,"First I must say that I'm not a big Tarantino fan anyway. I really like Jackie Brown, but the other Tarantinos I saw could in my opinion never live up to the hype that was made about them.Now Django is not much different. It's not really catastrophic. It actually is even funny in quite some scenes. But I still don't see what should make it from the solid B-Movie it really is to the masterpiece that a lot of people want to make us believe it is.I like the humor, I like the music and I like some of the homages. But it's too long and it isn't enough compelling or intelligent to make it a really good movie."
tt0137523,"David Fincher is someone I have come across recently. I have been delving deeper into studying directors and their films and David Fincher is on that list of mine.Fincher does a great job of using black fill and a low key lighting shot to complement the theme of ""Fight Club"".And along with the great cinematography is a great cast that put a ton of effort into making this movie be felt by the viewer.Unique, interesting, and funny are my words to use here."
tt1130884,"This is a very uneven movie: It has a sappy story, and is drawn-out in the telling, and it has sensationalist references to Nazis and the Holocaust; but these references can't be taken too seriously and thus seem exploitative, even though they are possibly important in understanding the main character. But there are some brilliant surrealist scenes and shots in SHUTTER ISLAND. The use of colour was very effective and involving.I'd read the book, so the suspense wasn't as great; the friend I saw it with, who had not read the book, liked the movie better than I did, and thought it was deeper than I did. The acting was good, particularly by Mark Ruffalo, and by actors who have only one scene, among them Patricia Clarkson, Elias Koteas."
tt0277289,"Fist Power is a fairly fast paced and action packed film vehicle for martial artist actor Vincent Zhao. However watchable, the movie is with not without flaws. The direction and editing is not the greatest and really sells the fighting talents of our hero short. The support cast(mostly utilized for comic relief) Sam Lee and good looks and love interest for Vincent Zhao, the very pretty Gigi Lai also appears. The legendary Cheng Pei Pei from Come Drink With Me and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon also makes a memorable, but brief appearance as Vincent Zhao's mom. The plot is driven and grounded by sympathetic antagonist Anthony Wong who is an ex British Marine that is trying to get back his son from the boy's biological father by holding up an elementary school. Anthony Wong's performance is about the only thing about this film that is excellent. But Fist Power is pretty decent for sure. While not a classic by any means, this should entertain most action fans for an hour and a half. I have not seen too many films with Vincent Zhao, but he is utilized much better in Yuen Woo Ping's True Legend. However, compared to a lot of stuff out there Fist Power is not bad at all."
tt0816692,"The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar.Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded.I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves ""behind"" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the ""black hole beyond the horizon"" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, ""all it takes is a little push ! ""*you'll have to see the movie to figure that one out.F√©lix Tardieu, November 1st, 2014"
tt0133093,"Why does everyone love these movies?  They are junk.  The story is none existent and full of rhetorical nonsense that's randomly placed and stolen from philosophers, the acting is pathetic, and I still believe the only reason people like this movie is because they are hypnotized by its ""dazzling"" special effects.  People consider these ground-breaking special effects...no.  Star Wars was ground-breaking, The Matrix is just people fighting for no reason other than to show off their ""great"" CGI.  I sure hope they don't decide to make a 4th. 3/10 stars."
tt1345836,"All right. I've said this before, and I'll say it again. Christopher Nolan is a great director. Few people can put a story on the screen like Nolan does. But the problem is that he's a terrible writer. How many more times does he have to absolutely assassinate a perfectly good story idea or character franchise with his amateurish, ham-handed writing before he and everyone else realizes this?First, he always sets clocks in motion. Really? Is that all you've got? A real writer can create a sense of urgency based on time constraints without introducing an actual clock, especially one that is strapped onto a device that seems to have no other need of a clock than to display its imminent intent to blow everything to kingdom come.Then of course, there's character development, or the lack of it. Batman is conflicted as to whether he should be Batman or not. Bane is conflicted by, oh, let's say puppy love. Catwoman is conflicted by whether or not she really wants to be bad. I mean, I know this whole franchise is based on a comic book, but with a price tag of a quarter of a billion dollars to make, does it have to play like one? Come on, Chris. Hire a writer.Basically, this is a movie that consists of lots of scenes of people either fighting, or walking aggressively toward a fight, with the central characters standing still like a Greek chorus of narrators long enough to tell the story, rather than participate in it, by presenting long, boring diatribes and monologues like a bunch of kids breathlessly setting forth a cowboys and Indians scenario before they run around whooping and shooting, only to repeat, in this case for three tedious, exasperating hours.I love superhero movies when they are able, like all good science fiction, to transcend their admittedly contrived premises by presenting witty and profound issues in clever and unique ways without hammering you over the head or numbing your brain with endless sequences of violence and destruction. Once again, Chris, you have failed in the former by wallowing in the latter."
tt0109830,"""Forrest Gump"" is a timeless cinematic masterpiece that transcends genres and captures the essence of the American experience. Released in 1994 and directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film follows the life of Forrest Gump, a simple-minded yet kind-hearted man whose journey takes him through some of the most pivotal moments in American history.At its core, ""Forrest Gump"" is a story about the power of perseverance, love, and the triumph of the human spirit. Through the eyes of Forrest, played brilliantly by Tom Hanks, we witness a life filled with both joy and sorrow, triumphs and challenges. From his childhood struggles with leg braces to his time serving in the Vietnam War, Forrest's unwavering optimism and resilience inspire us to never give up, no matter the obstacles we face.One of the film's most poignant themes is the idea of destiny and how our choices shape our lives. Throughout the movie, we see how Forrest's seemingly random encounters and decisions lead him on a path that intersects with key historical events and influential figures, from meeting Elvis Presley to inspiring John Lennon's iconic song ""Imagine."" These moments not only highlight Forrest's unwitting role in shaping history but also underscore the idea that every action we take has consequences, both big and small.The relationship between Forrest and his childhood friend and love interest, Jenny, played by Robin Wright, is central to the film's emotional core. Their bond, which spans decades and is marked by love, heartbreak, and redemption, is a testament to the enduring power of friendship and the impact of unconditional love. Jenny's struggles with her own demons and inner turmoil mirror the societal upheavals of the time, adding depth and complexity to her character and highlighting the film's exploration of personal growth and redemption.""Forrest Gump"" is also a visual marvel, thanks to Zemeckis' masterful direction and groundbreaking special effects. The seamless integration of Forrest into historical footage and events, such as his meeting with President Kennedy or running across the country multiple times, creates a sense of wonder and magic that enhances the film's storytelling. The use of visual motifs, such as the feather that symbolizes destiny and freedom, adds layers of meaning and symbolism to the narrative, inviting viewers to reflect on the deeper themes at play.The film's soundtrack, featuring iconic songs from the 1950s to the 1980s, serves as a powerful emotional backdrop to Forrest's journey. From the uplifting melodies of ""Sweet Home Alabama"" to the haunting strains of ""Forrest Gump Suite,"" each song enhances the mood and atmosphere of the scenes, evoking nostalgia and emotion in equal measure.In conclusion, ""Forrest Gump"" is a cinematic tour de force that continues to resonate with audiences around the world. Its timeless themes of love, destiny, and perseverance, combined with stellar performances and innovative storytelling techniques, have cemented its status as a classic in the annals of film history. Through Forrest Gump's unforgettable journey, we are reminded of the enduring power of hope, resilience, and the human capacity for greatness in the face of adversity."
tt0111161,"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a kind of morality tale that is definitely one of Stephen King's more restrained kind of stories, dealing mostly with a character study of two individuals sharing imprisonment and the consequences that await them when the tale ends.TIM ROBBINS is a man wrongly convicted of murder and serving a long prison term while MORGAN FREEMAN (who plays the narrator with great dignity) describes himself as ""the only guilty man in Shawshank."" The hardships of prison life are captured in brief scenes that make the viewer wish that Robbins will find a way of escape.Along the way, he is gang raped by prisoners and treated harshly by a brutal warden and some of his spirit seems to vanish. But Robbins is quietly effective as a prisoner who makes a good adjustment when he takes charge of the prison library and sees to it that there's a wider selection of books than the kind of potboilers that King is noted for writing. A touch of irony here, no? The closing scenes are a bit of a stretch and a reminder of just who wrote this prison tale--but still, they make an impact because of all that happens before.It's a bittersweet story, a sort of horrific fairy-tale of what might have happened, but the viewer will be caught up in the story because of the tremendously skillful story-telling magic of Stephen King and director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay."
tt0230379,This is one of the 'best' mystery series I've ever watched! I saw it once way back in the seventies and have looked for it ever since. Chad Everett is very convincing in his role in this film. The film has an air of romance as well as mystery and suspense. I've searched movie books and TV Guide issues for years attempting to find this movie again but to no avail until I was able to locate it online. Since the film is British that would explain why I've had such trouble finding it since I live in America. Now I just have to see if I can still buy it somehow because I long to watch it again after all these years. Maybe I can find it somehow.
tt0114369,"I hated this movie, if I wanted to see a movie with that much blood I would go to a war movie. And if I wanted to see something as gross as an, autopsy. The only good thing about this movie was the acting. I saw this movie at home, if I had gone to the movie in a theater I would have walked out in the middle and asked for my money back. That was my mom's opinion, on this horrific movie! For me I found it to be repulsive, I have seen some awful movies before. But this was a lot worse than awful , from beginning to end . It was demented and disturbing and if anyone thought that it was great needs help! We give it an F!"
tt0068646,"I decided to give this movie a go after seeing it in the #2 spot in the IMDB top 250 list.This movie establishes the characters well, and all of the acting in this movie seemed top notch, with even small character roles being portrayed convincingly throughout the film.Unfortunately, a large portion of the film contained long scenes that caused me to rapidly lose attention or become sleepy. The excessive amount of time (eg. The first 30 mins at the wedding) does not do well to set the pace of the film - instead lulling the audience into a dozy stupor in which many viewers would be tempted to jump on their phone.The notable parts of this movie are the parts where action happens: the tense encounter with the police chief, the scene at the boom gates, the emotional garden scene with the don/grandson. These are the noteworthy parts of the film where the cast are finally given a chance to flex their talents.Unfortunately, I have to agree with many other low reviewer's summaries when I say this movie is overrated. While it may have been a great movie in the 1970's, or even 1980's, this movie is less likely to earn a 10 star review in 2021, and more likely to give you a three hour nap on the sofa."
tt0133093,"You walk into this film not knowing what the Matrix is. You take your seat and watch the trailers. The green Warner Brothers (green? you ask) trademark comes up, and without warning you are thrust into the Wachowski brothers grand vision. 2 hours of excitement later, you stumble out of the cinema, knowing what the Matrix is.This is one great movie. Keanu Reeves is cooler than cool as Neo. The Wachowski brothers skilful direction is brilliant. The special effects sequences will blow you away, did I mention the government lobby scene?The film starts off with a 'what is real?' first half, and then the first kung-fu sequence makes way for an action- packed, John Woo-esque second half with slomo and style cranked up all the way to the top. Did I mention the government lobby scene?Keanu becomes Cool Keanu, Carrie-Anne Moss is a real find and Hugo Weaving is perfect in his against typecasting role as the evil Agent Smith.You may notice in this review that I have not revealed what the Matrix is. Like the trailer says, 'You have to see it for yourself.'Excellent. Best film of '99. 9/10."
tt0110912,"What is the big deal with this movie?  The movie SO boring, uninteresting, and full of a bunch of moronic and trashy characters.  I just don't get why people like this film so much.  It truly saddens me that this film has, for some god-awful reason, made it into IMDB's top 250 (and currently top 20). This film is most definitely in my bottom 250.Here are some of the many problems I had with this film:The scene where Bruce Willis' character was first introduced is one of the most visually painful scenes I've ever seen, I was ready to turn the movie off right there.  The camera just sits there on Bruce Willis' face and doesn't move for what seems to be an eternity.  What on earth was Quentin thinking?The best way to describe this movie is ""just a bunch of STUFF"", there's no real plot here and the story doesn't go anywhere?  I found it really hard to give a SH*T about any of the characters, and I couldn't care less if any of them got shot or killed.What was with that scene where Uma Thurman's character says ""Don't be a square"" and she forms a little square with her hands (If you haven't seen the movie then you won't know what I mean)?  That was so STUPID!!!  I just don't get stuff like that.  Too weird for me. ...And people call this a comedy?  Where the f&*k is the comedy?  Is it supposed to be funny when they go over the speed bump and shoot the guy in the back seat?  That isn't funny, that's SICK!  The only part that I laughed at was when John Travolta and Sam Jackson were talking about eating pork/bacon.  I thought that was a pretty funny conversation, but other than that I didn't find the movie funny at all.I'll never say ""don't waste you're time"" while referring to a movie, cause everybody has different tastes. So if you feel so inclined, go ahead and watch it, but I HATED it.  I hope you enjoy it more than I ever will. Thanks for putting up with my ranting and raving,-Chris"
tt0068646,"All these years people have been praising this film to no end. Yesterday I watched it for the first time just to see how good it really was.First I feel quite disturbed. All the brutal shooting, wife beating, and all forms of killing and hurting made me quite uncomfortable. To me, it makes no sense to glorify violence to such degree.Put the excessive violence aside, this movie is not bad. I was not bored at all while watching it. But do I get the same satisfaction after watching Schindler's List, Taxi Driver, or Lord of the Ring series? Not really. Will I see it again? Probably not. To me, once is enough."
tt0468569,"** PLOT SPOILERS EVERYWHERE **Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is one of the better films in the history of its genre, however, it does not qualify as a masterpiece. In fact, it's quite far from such a distinction. It falls short of unquestionable excellence because of a ridiculously high number of plot holes, most of which regard The Joker and his criminal exploits.It is a given that Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker leaves us with a character who is thoughtful, unpredictable, ruthless, unrelenting, and arguably insane. That is to say, some inconsistencies in the villain should be accepted, if not embraced. But others, to be frank, are unacceptable because of their stupidity. For example: In the film's opening sequence, a clever bank heist spearheaded by The Joker, the crazed clown kills off his partners as the caper progresses. At the time, it made sense. Pretty simple, the more colleagues he kills off, the more money that leaves for him. But later on in the film, The Joker burns his half of the criminal underworld's combined fortune. He makes it overtly clear that he is not motivated by money. Not in the least bit.So why was the money a factor in the opening scene? It shouldn't have been. Uneven scripting there.But that's nitpicking in comparison to the film's greater faults. The ultimate reason why ""The Dark Knight"" falls short of the masterpiece label is because there is absolutely no way, under any circumstances, at any time, on any planet or in any solar system, that The Joker could execute so many complex plans in such a short period of time.OK, here is where people start saying: ""But it's a movie! It doesn't have to be possible."" I know, thanks. I agree, it doesn't have to be possible. But, and this is a huge BUT, a film as ambitious and lengthy as ""The Dark Knight"" wants to be taken seriously. Not only does it want to be taken seriously, I think director Christopher Nolan wants Oscar consideration for the work he has put in here, and cast members have been saying regularly that they don't want this to be considered as a mere ""superhero movie,"" or ""action movie."" Well if you want to elevate to the level of serious drama, then you have to explain a few things to me.(1) How does The Joker continue to find willing participants in his escapades when all of his previous crew members end up dead or in jail? The guys he's finding to work for him have to be true idiots. Totally brainless. And that doesn't work because The Joker's plans are meticulous and require precise timing and execution. If these goons are dumb enough to work for him, they aren't smart enough to be effective as help. It's a perpetual contradiction throughout the film, particularly the second act.(2) Sure The Joker is swift and tricky, but c'mon, he doesn't exactly look like a normal citizen. If city-wide security has been heightened to a level never before seen, how the hell is this maniac with a painted face and wacky hair not being spotted? Does he have an invisible transportation machine or something? He doesn't have supernatural powers, so he shouldn't have a supernatural aura.(3) When did he have the time to wire the hospital with bombs? Even if one of his goons did it, how did no one in the hospital notice suspicious activity? What about the assassination attempt on the Mayor? The other cops on the firing line didn't notice the most infamous villain in the city standing right next to them? Why? Because he crouched over a little and tried not to make eye contact with them? Please. I could go on for days, too many plot liberties were taken.I'd actually like to discuss the performances a bit. I think the separation between the strongest part and the rest of the cast is the largest ever with an ensemble of this size and magnitude. Meaning, Heath Ledger's performance was far and away the best in this film, better to the point where it bothered me that no one else was in his realm. The scenes where Ledger was off screen lacked the magnetism and intrigue of the ones in which he appeared. Although appeared is probably not the best word, more like dominated.Christian Bale was OK as Batman, but he's almost too stoic for a character with such strong morals and opinions. He's also a little bit stiff when he's in playboy mode as Bruce Wayne. I think his performance in ""The Prestige"" was more emotional, effective, and polished.Aaron Eckhart was all right as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, but the problem was that the vast majority of the time I was seeing Eckhart on screen, not Dent. The same Eckhart we saw in ""Thank You For Smoking."" Also, a man with a finely tuned social philosophy, like Dent, would not totally flip his ideology after the loss of a close loved one. Hopefully the angle is that the toxin causing the disfigurement messed more with his brain than we were led on to believe.Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were believable as always, but of course they are underused as Alfred and Lucius Fox. Gary Oldman probably contributed the second strongest performance in the film as Commissioner Gordon, and Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Rachel Dawes) was a step up from Katie Holmes as far as execution and timing -- but that's not saying much.I really could go on for days about the unacceptable plot liberties, but I'll spare you. All in all, I liked the film because it had some thought-provoking sequences involving moral dilemmas and intriguing societal questions, and in having such ""The Dark Knight"" succeeded in escaping the ""superhero movie"" label. But it's not a masterpiece.Plain and simply, it has too many holes."

tt0120737,"the problem of the movie is mainly that it is made to be liked by as many people as possible, and that¬¥s never a good start for anything. i don¬¥t like jacksons personal visions of the book. he degraded the horrifying black riders to nothing more than weak actionfigures. saruman is too early and often shown, so he can¬¥t be as fear-creating as he is in the book. his (jacksons) direction is more or less unsatisfying, and the acting is -with the exception of hugo weaving (elrond)- bad. jackson would have done good respecting that ""the lord of the rings"" is no romance but some sort of great ""fantasy road movie"". missing bombadil and good-fitting music (from rosenman) i will by any time prefer the bakshi animated-feature from 1978 (although it¬¥s incomplete, and bombadil is missing too.. someone finish this movie, pleeeeease).. i¬¥m personally disappointed that a great man like howard shore (crash, silence of the lambs, dead ringers, existenz, the fly, ed wood) could do such a boring score."
tt1130884,"After watching 'shutter island' all I could say is wow! The twists and turns of this incredible detective movie are amazing and I'm sure it's a movie you can watch twice, and see it differently both times. The end left my jaw hanging in surprise and it's the first movie or TV show to ever make me do that! I applaud the main character as the wide range of emotions shown are incredible! The movie creates a sense of eeriness throughout and kept me on the edge of my seat! The tension and eeriness created are just fantastic and really immersed me into how the characters were feeling. Overall you should definitely watch 'shutter island' and I promise you, you won't regret it."
tt0114369,"It really brings nothing new, it's basically a long CSI episode with no edge to it what so ever. It all was very predictable, and in the end of the day there wasn't a single scene in the movie made me go 'WOW'. It just that nothing felt new, in contrast to what films of that supposed caliber should do. I think most of the love to it is deriving from people tendency to get excited from the two main actors, especially freeman for some unclear reason.All in all it is a pretty standard movie, that's the problem with it and unfortunately also the only source of it's positives.I'm not usually reviewing movies, but this one felt so blatantly overrated to me that I felt like I have to."
tt0361748,"This is actually the only World War II film I found myself glued to the screen because of how fun and enjoyable this is. I believe this is one of Tarantino's greatest works from the 21st century. This film has everything, it has comedy, an excellent soundtrack and a ingenious plot set over five chapters. All I can say is that this film is just fun."
tt7286456,"""Joker"" is nor a ""masterpiece"" nor is it ""flawless"" as this board boasts. It's mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix's part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlights many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding. Sprinkled in are a few light-hearted moments to remind you that ""hey, the Joker is still funny at times""... But with the strained mental illness angle it's difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit of introspection on what it is and who it is you're laughing at. The real ""danger"" this movie poses is that it's another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling... Which does way more harm than good.There is no great existential pandering, as some are saying... ""it's deep"", ""my feels"", ""It's not a superhero movie it's a character study"", regardless of what anyone wants to categorize it as.. I'll consider it a generous 3."
tt0167261,"In a trilogy, the second part is always the most difficult to create because it loses the charm of the discovery and lacks the thrill of the conclusion. The goal is to develop the characters and conclude with a solid cliffhanger that will be resolved in the last part. Thus, it's not just passing by.Unfortunately, this movie is this kind. It fails to reach classics as ""Star Wars V"" or ""BTTF 2"" and it's as dull as ""Star Trek 3"". Nothing really fundamental happens here: it's just another steps in the journey. Moreover, the fluidity of the first movie is lost because the characters are now split into three groups. I dozed two times watching it: in the Rohan country and during the Helm's Deep battle.But the responsibility goes to Tolkien because LOTR aren't really three stories but a huge, colossal single story divided in three parts by the editor. And a night rainy battle will be always more exciting on a paper than on screen.To leave on a happier note, i must say that the extra are interesting and really help to understand all the passion that people have put in this trilogy. That's why the chain-maker is so funny: With his desperate and weary voice, he explains that armors needs thousands of rings, that rings come in three models and that in a day of work, he can chains as much as a big scarf!"
tt0361748,"After watching Inglorious Basterds i was really surprised when i saw ratings on IMDb. Didn't expected high ratings and top 250 place. If we can only isolate and rate Christoph Waltz's acting performance i would agree that this movie deserves 10. But he is not alone, and his performance can't cover horrible plot, boring conversations, unfunny characters, alternative QT WW2 fantasy and Eli Roth as Jew bear.The opening scene with Denis Menochet as farmer and Christoph Waltz as SS officer is best part of the movie. Only part that have same quality and connects tension from that scene with the rest of the movie is a basement scene. Basement scene was crossroad for me. Michael Fassbender was great in role of British spy and his character adds some new layer of logic and realism in movie. In moments you can actually see some plot finally breaking through the rubbish you watched after the farm scene. After the basement chapter, movie is going nowhere.Empty space. A lot of empty space for movie that last 153 minutes. Long and boring scenes with boring characters and conversations. Childish fantasy mixed up with Spaghetti western movies and some atmosphere that don't belong to WW2 period. Thats why we have basterds to fill everything else and patch the rest of movie. They failed. Basterds are weakest/undeveloped and most boring part of movie. Movie is named by them, yes - Brad is on Movie poster ... but they are horrible. Worst role of Mr Pitt and i hope last one from Eli Roth.Cinema/Shosanna story with David Bowie music was just another QT patch v1.1 to fill huge empty space between farm and basement. Extremely boring scenes with M√©lanie Laurent (taking off cinema letters, red dresses, secret love Marcel...) will blast your brain. Yes - headache is a must.Beside 2 good scenes, i really enjoyed listening smooth gradient of German, French and English language. But again, this is connected to Waltz and Fassbender and their personal knowledge that Tarantino used for his fantasy.Inglorious Basterds is Hybrid movie where gangsters are replaced with Nazis adding them wild west background layer with Brad Pitt on movie poster just to sell tickets. It doesn't work in this case.5/10 - only for Christoph Waltz and Michael Fassbender."
tt0172495,"It's starts out like any good epic should with a masterfully filmed and executed exciting battle sequence that sets up the audience for one of those rare Hollywoodian confections that are both entertaining and artsy. Unfortunately, it all goes downhill from there. It isn't the performers faults since every single one of them give amazing, emotional, even, at times, riveting performances (the kinds you should find in better movies) and who give the whole picture more class than it deserves. It isn't Hanz Zimmer's nor Lisa Gerrard's fault since they have composed a score that's almost (and I do mean almost) as unforgettable as the Godfather's. And it certainly isn't Ridely Scott's fault since he yet again succeeds in immersing the audience in the world he has created. No, the ones who are to blame are the people who wrote the saccharine, clich√©d, soap-opery script and who, in the process, have wasted all of this incredible talent. They should be fed to the lions. It's an entertaining B-movie that could have been a classic. Just like Titanic in a way."
tt0108052,"Very difficult to make a generic and objectively assess to this movie, which there are some righteous doubts in the authenticity of the historical background in. But Steven Spielberg, preferring to take on faith a history of the German businessman Oskar Schindler, with his characteristic royal scope, built his own ¬´spielberg's¬ª version of the story, that impressed him, editing the storyline, characters and types of the main actors in accordance with his personal and commercial considerations.Only abstracting away from the doubts in plausibility filmed story, I can appreciate enjoy a film with unbiased perception. It is possible even to seek assistance with a particular extent of delight under such stipulations. A beautiful and moving story of selfless and honest German businessman, member of the Nazi party, Oskar Schindler, a brave, daring, going against the system.But importunate and suspicious taste of something unnatural and inedible prevents obediently to chew and swallow the product prepared by Spielberg,having never choked.What was guided by Steven Spielberg, forcing him to stop his choice on a candidature of Ralph Fiennes for the Amon Goeth's role? Maybe his diabolical sexuality? But, pardon me, the real Amon Goeth evoked a completely different impressions! He inspired fear and trembling! Make-up artists vainly tried to abundantly dye in a dark the reddish color of the face's ¬´vegetation¬ª of the actor; the actor vainly rehearsed in front of the mirror the most disgusting and frightening cruelty's ¬´symptoms¬ª on the his face; he vainly stuck out his unnaturally drooped, due to excessive ¬´Guinnes¬ª consumption, belly, - Ralph Fiennes was hopelessly far from a real Amon Goeth. The Spielberg's idea was realized! The Director's idea to draw the increased attention to historical-biographical drama of the female audience with the help of the charming ¬´bad boy¬ª, who gracefully shoots, as morning exercises, the Jews, frightened to death, from his villa's balcony, - is failed to cheer him. It was successful so well, that we don't feel fair disgust and loathing for Fiennes's character. On the contrary, sometimes we laugh over his comic remarks and ridiculous pomposity. So where disgust will undertake from, if the adventurous Director turned cruel, mentally unbalanced alcoholic into polished glamorous SS-dummy!? Women are thrilled and fall into a hypnotic trance from his painted bottomless black eyes, men delightedly appreciate elegant SS-uniform, perfectly tailored fit, and negligent, but so graceful possession of firearms. That's a truly excellent and win-win move! It's hard to call the real Goeth even a little attractive and charismatic. Especially in the years when he became a commandant of Plaszow. Overweight, with a huge shivering belly, with a bloated of regular alcoholic libation, lop-eared, balding guy with the loathsome appearance, he doesn't distantly even remind the noble thoroughbred appearance of the British actor. The question is, why Tim Roth's candidate, originally proposed for the role of Plaszow's commandant didn't please Spielberg? That's really who would fully embody this odious image, having forced the audience to feel hate and contempt for his character. Having conveyed the impeccability and truthfulness of the story, the Director wouldn't receive delights and falls of thankful sobs. His ennobled and presumptuous Oscar Schindler had to be pleasant to the audience by all means, having excluded any suspicions in decency and unselfishness of his true outbursts. His glossy and dandified Amon Goeth, also should not have caused the unanimous disgust among spectators, but finely contribute to the commercial success of the film. And these characters were undoubtedly successful! With the only one amendment: they are hopelessly far from their real prototypes.Why the eminent director so responsibly and meticulously approached to selection of the skinny and too exhausted men and women, participating in the crowd of prisoners of concentration camp, but so ridiculously missed with the main embodiment of the evil in the movie? Just only one Steven Spielberg knows, why the main characters and story lines of the screened story are so mercilessly deformed, while the secondary moments are scrupulously and meticulously closed to the reality¬Ö But as a result, everybody remained happy: the Director didn't manage to count the box office and receive enthusiastic praises of film critics choking with impressions, actors ""coin boxes"" were replenished with new characteristic roles, and the audience that believed in a fairy tale of good and unselfish German businessman, didn't manage to change handkerchiefs, become impregnated through with their fluids of snot and drool.What in general to create the caricatures on tragical, historical and biographic dramas for? The talented Spielberg has many excellent movies in different genres, from the same military And to science fiction, so it is possible to turn around in the full extent of his inexhaustible and rich imagination within the screenplay. But no, he prepared his project for years, diligently and concentrated studied biographies of heroes, met with eyewitnesses of events, carried out an actor's castings, so the audience saw the upside down turned story in the end. The story, where we with equal degree of sympathy treat both charming Oscar Schindler, and deliberately comical and not less charming Amon Goeth, with manicured fingers and porcelain face from the excess of make-up. And, by the way, ¬´Schindler's List¬ª - is one of the movies-the Champions of the number of absurd and rude goofs. Alas, it often happens, that the grandiose plan is realized in the same grandiose project, it interferes the deep perception with it's coverage and the grandiloquent announcement, programming the ¬´consumers¬ª for quite expected unanimous, just weak-sighted admiration.By the way, Roman Polanski ignored the search of weedy and bony actors for his crowd scene in his ¬´The Pianist¬ª , but he is fully focused on the main thing, creating almost identical to the real cinematic images. The Director honestly conveyed the authenticity of the story, without romantic embellishment and alternative finals.But Steven Spielberg believes that he has all the reasons to rewrite the history."
tt1345836,"I had no real expectations for this movie but never thought it would be that bad. The tone is sort of alright, but the pacing is terrible, not to mention it just didn't had to be that long. Acting is mediocre at best and the action scenes are unimaginative. Compared to the other two movies its just crap.I believe when it comes to superhero movies in Hollywood they are just generally getting the whole picture wrong. And its especially tricky in the case of Batman since he is also a unique ¬Ñanimal"" among all the DC and Marvel superheroes since he doesn't have any kind of superpower.You know there is a difference being Batman and a guy wearing a bat costume. There must be a reason why a character dresses like ¬Ñidiot"". In the comics and cartoons Batman is intimidating and turns out to be an extremely clever guy, always planning ahead and bringing interesting moral questions into the equasion while Bruce Wayne is like any other generic person. Here Christian Bale is a guy wearing a bat costume and this time there is no Heath Ledger to save the movie. Don't get me wrong its not just the actor's fault, creating a perfect Batman requires the cooperation of the director, the writers etc...Apart from that there are many problems with the movie bu I don't feel the need to list them on a wall of text."
tt1853728,"Wonderful acting, pristine production quality, original plot.That being said... it's just another Tarantino movie, meaning the usual checklist of violence is complete - rape, torture, death of a parent in front of a child, knee-cap shots, gut shots, genital mutilation/dick shots, eyes gouged out (there's even a scene when Django is practicing shooting on a snow man - Tarantino even manages to gouge out the snow man's eyes and get a dick shot in on the snowman too). There are no good guys, just bad guys - the villains being pure evil with no redeeming human qualities; the protagonists are just as bad as the bad guys but parade under the justification that the villains are worse than they are so the violence is justified.The villains are one-dimensional at best (white slave owners that torture their slaves), and at worst simply names and faces to set up and knock down."
tt1853728,"For anyone who isn't much into cinema, I would recommend watching Django Unchained and you will fall in love with films forever.This film is a classic western full of drama, suspense and tension with a tremendously unpredictable plot but with a sense of realism taken into consideration.I believe it would be hard to dislike this masterpiece as it has it all: action, adventure and even a sense of romance and the occasional humour."
tt0167260,"I reckon it is because we know of the successful ending to the story that takes all the surprises from the script. I was disappointed nonetheless: Every word spoken is ""heavy"" and full of ""meaning"", the battle scene with the riders taking on the elephants is outright stupid-silly. No smart military leader would ever have ordered to attack such foe head-on (and still succeed...). You could bet that in each and every new scene, trouble was only about 30 seconds away. Very annoying. Did Aragon ever smile once? Always looked like having a big tummy ache. Any of the others smiling? OK, Gandalf did once, I think. The end was as kitchy as it could be - and incomprehensible, to me at least: Why would Frodo choose to leave the Shire?? It may be in the book or not, I don't care. This just didn't make any sense.^Technically of course it was more than state of the art, but even this got me bored eventually. I was glad when this part and the whole series was finally over.This project would have been better served in a TV series of say 900 minutes or so. Of course, it would have lost the big-screen ""oversize"" which was nice most of the times. But the movies as long as they were did not do justice to the books. Probably no movie(s) could ever achieve this."
tt7286456,"OK, the story is nice and the acting is excellent. But the movie suffers from three bad things:1- Boring and uninteresting dialog. There are a lot of them.2- Too slow pace.3- Too lengthy. Too much time for very little number of ideas.These three things combined are more than enough to destroy any movie. It is the first time I have felt that I need to look at the watch to know how much left for the movie to end. Beside this, the genre is supposed to be a thriller in addition to crime and drama, but it is too far from being a thriller.I cannot understand the exaggerated high ratings for this movie. I want to be fair with it. So although it is boring, I give it 4 stars for the story and the acting, but definitely the movie does not worth 5 stars or more. Consequently, I cannot recommend this movie."
tt1853728,"Django Unchained presents the larger-than-life tale of a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) who collaborates with Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz)‚Äîa German dentist-turn-bounty hunter‚Äîin order to rescue his wife from the servitude of a ruthless Mississippi plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). The story begins in the US state of Texas in the year 1858‚Äîtwo years prior to the start of the American Civil War. The tone of the movie is set by Luis Enriquez Bacalov's original ""Django Theme Song"" sung by Rocky Roberts‚Äîtaken as it is from Sergio Cobucci's Django (1966)‚Äîwhich plays with the opening credits. Django Unchained is Tarantino's tribute to the visionaries of Western filmmaking‚Äîthose who conceptualized the decorated genre and more so those who prevented it from dying by reinventing it. The Western genre has always fascinated Tarantino. Right from the beginning of his career it has been his dream to make a Western of his own. Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci are the two filmmakers who seem to have inspired him the most. With Django Unchained, Tarantino finally seems to be living his lifelong dream of emulating his childhood idol. And what makes Django Unchained even more special is the fact that it comes at a time when the Western genre once again finds itself on the brink of obsolescence.While the classic works of John Ford and Howard Hawkes epitomize the golden age of Western filmmaking, the grotesque, tongue-in-cheeky works of Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci‚Äîoften referred to as Italo-Western or more prominently as Spaghetti Western‚Äîclearly represent its new age. At a time when Western genre was looked upon by most filmmakers as dead and buried, Leone and Corbucci not only rejuvenated it but also changed its very face for the better. The Old West which was once governed by the tenets of pride, honor, chivalry, machismo and idealism got metamorphosed into a brutal realm inhabited by realistic, grey-shaded characters that despite their endless flaws couldn't be deemed completely devoid of human virtues. While Leone is often regarded as the master creator of Spaghetti Western cinema, people often overlook the indelible contribution made by Corbucci. With movies like Django (1966) and The Great Silence (1968), Corbucci succeeded in adding a whole new dimension to the Spaghetti Western canvas by painting a nightmarish world haunted by fascist ideologies. In fact, Corbucci's depiction of the Old West was so lurid, stark, brutal and vicious that it made Leone's portrayal appear remarkably dull and placid in comparison.There's absolutely no doubt whatsoever that with Django Unchained Quentin Tarantino consummates his trademark style‚Äîbuilt around the uncanny combination of gore, glamour, grotesquerie, and dark humor‚Äîwhich is often described using the adjective ""Tarantinoesque"". The movie's filming style also bears a striking similarity to Sergio Corbucci's sanguinary, majestic Spaghetti Western masterpiece: The Great Silence (1968). In Django Unchained, Tarantino fiddles with history (but falls short of rewriting it unlike his previous film Inglourious Basterds) to present his own perspective on several delicate issues mainly concerning slavery. Tarantino's naked display of uncorroborated brutalities associated with the inhumane practice of slavery, especially Mandingo as its extension has given rise to discontent among certain sections of the white community. Likewise, the movie has received condemnation from the likes of Spike Lee and Tavis Smiley for glorifying the n-word in the tradition of blaxploitation films. Django Unchained features special appearances from Jonah Hill, Don Johnson, Quentin Tarantino and Franco Nero who had played the titular role in the 1966 Spaghetti Western classic Django.Tarantino's imaginative direction is well backed up by some commendable acting performances from movie's lead as well as supporting cast. Jamie Foxx delivers his best performance in years, one that is perhaps bettered only by his Oscar-winning portrayal in Ray (2004). Despite bearing several similarities to his multi-lingual part in Inglorious Basterds, Christoph Waltz portrayal easily forms the backbone of the movie. Tarantino once again takes full advantage of Waltz's polyglot abilities and uses it to great effect at different points in the film. Waltz's Schultz is basically a representation of all those white men who raised their voice against slavery and contributed to its abolition. Behind his facade of a cold-blooded bounty hunter we discover a righteous human being whose superior intellect is well matched by his great sense of compassion. He inexorable resolve to rescue Broomhilda and his sacrifice in the end inexplicably brings to mind of the great sacrifice made by Abraham Lincoln. Schultz is a symbol of white men's conscience, courage and virtue in the same way as Samuel L. Jackson's Stephen is a symbol of Black men's pusillanimity, servility and hypocrisy. Thus, Stephen in many ways is Waltz's antithesis and the movie's true antagonist. And to Jackson's credit, he plays the part with great subtlety, guile and conviction. According to this critic, it's his best performance since Pulp Fiction (1994). Leonardo DiCaprio, in a rare negative portrayal, delivers a thumping performance as the sadistic Calvin Candie. A megalomaniac who dresses with the perfection of a fop, Candie is quite easily one of the most menacing Western villains of all time. Kerry Washington plays the part of the slave-girl Broomhilda‚Äîthe only major female part in the movie‚Äîwith exquisite charm.Overall, Django Unchained has its flaws and suffers from anachronisms and incongruities, some deliberate and some not so. But, Tarantino still manages to pack a strong punch. From the cinematic point of view, Django Unchained is undoubtedly a lesser work in comparison to Inglourious Basterds (2009). But the audacious yet effective manner in which Django Unchained retraces the history, fiddles with it, and presents its dark side makes it an important work of cinema. Django Unchained is unusually high on style, but luckily there's enough substance to keep an intelligent viewer interested. Highly recommended!A more detailed review of the movie can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
tt1375666,"Inception no more explores dreams and the human mind than Star Wars explores outer space. Inception is a rip-off of the novel Fireflies in the Shadow of the Sun (FSS), published in 2004 but preceded by a web site on dreams (2001-2009), the thrust of which is about how dream experiences are the source of ideas and other changes to waking life, including personality development. The broader point is that like his character Dom Cobb, Nolan himself steals the ideas he needs to create Inception from a novelist and life long dream researcher.Chapter 7 titled ""Journey by Deflection"" occurs entirely in a shared dream in which 2 protagonists ascend / descend through ""levels of dreaming"" in action-oriented sequences and even a ""dream within a dream,"" addressing how intermittent awareness of the dreams affects the dream. But Inception does not (a) intrigue / illuminate as to how these levels are distinct and yet intrinsically related or (b) draw from real dreams and real similarities to waking life. Inception is just an action film set in dream space that neglects the essence of dreaming in dream symbolism. The dream space featured in Inception is fictitious -- a contrivance of both Nolan and of the architect in Nolan's story.Inception would have benefited by emulating FSS in the one way it did not emulate it. In FSS the characters trapped in the shared dream have to solve the dream's logic in order to wake up. This plot is much more conducive to an education of the language of dreams, which FSS author spent an entire lifetime understanding from the time he started a diary of his own dreams at age 13 to his doctoral dissertation at age 27 exploring the relationship between dream experiences, coping strategies, blood chemistry, and symptoms in terminally ill cancer patients. Like FSS however, and this is yet another coincidental similarity between the two works, in Inception the characters are thwarted by a dream that is plugged into their mental efforts to understand it. Also as in FSS, the dreamers have to deal with the denizens of a dream world that react to periodic episodes of lucid awareness of the dream. In FSS, the whole script, including objects and aspects of the environment, respond to the awareness, but in Inception we get the juvenile and scientifically ignorant development that other characters in the dream respond to Dom Cobb and his team like white blood cells to foreign pathogens. The bottom line is that FSS teaches us things about dreams and Inception will impress only the most psychologically unsophisticated among us or those who have never remembered a dream in their life.Also like FSS, Inception makes the point that much of the bizarreness of dreams is attributable to a higher-order thinking. It does this using a statement very similar to one from the former FSS web site, which maintained that while dreaming is a whole brain activity, the conscious person uses only about 3-5% of his or her brain. FSS author remarks that experiencing and trying to make sense of a dream is like trying to fit 100% of something into 3-5% of itself -- there will be distortion!The subject matter notwithstanding, Nolan's storytelling and direction are designed to give artificial weight to the real value of plot twists. In Nolan we have a director who conceals and compensates for second-rate thinking with CGI and high-octane action that detracts from the story without getting the blood flowing. The action in the film was supposed to create a sense of time-sensitive suspense, but came across more like the dull dishwater backing up in my sink than a raging river.There are also inconsistencies in the film. Nolan wants us to invest in the idea that everything that happens in a dream has an effect on the waking life of the dreamer. It works -- until Dom Cobb dismisses out of hand his shooting of all these dream characters like they were throngs of disposable orcs or storm troopers, claiming its OK because they are ""merely projections of the subconscious."" Suddenly, what happens in dream Vegas stays in dream Vegas. And where did the idea of ""limbo"" come from -- introduced as a patchwork device for a poorly articulated plot.And much of the film's premise is contradicted by real research which shows that the relationship between perceived and actual dream time is roughly 1:1."
tt7286456,One of the best films I've seen for ages. Phoenix deserves an Oscar.
tt1345836,"To begin, I was really nervous about this film. Ending a trilogy, bringing in a new villain with Bane, a major new character with Selina Kyle, and an original character/sidekick in John Blake all within three hours. That's a daunting task for any director, Nolan or otherwise. I won't touch on every character or scene, just the ones that stood out the most to me. The shots are wide and grand, some scenes playing out with little to no score - a move that gives complete focus to the screen. The opening with Bane's arrival had me on the edge of my seat. Tom Hardy played the character as few could, showing a strong physique and unquestionable mannerisms. Bane's voice (a source of debate) was unique and brought a different edge to the antagonist. I knew watching this character that he could - and would kill or main anyone in his path and also had the brain to create plans on a massive scale. Selina Kyle is a very welcome addition to the film. Anne Hathaway with her sly personality and actions created a very good character, but the 'suit' scenes were the weak point of her performance I feel. I hoped Catwoman wouldn't be the major focus and I was pleased, she was a burglar, not a superhero. That, actually, is what I feared the most. Adding two companions to Batman's already strong group with Alfred and Gordon could easily dull their screen time. Gary Oldman once again brought a very emotional and strong role. With Gordon being taken out and staying in the background for most of the duration seemed to add weight to his performance. Alfred was placed in a similar role, doing a fantastic job of bringing the tears when he was in the frame. Michael Caine has proved himself to be a master actor, and even in a small role he brings a presence that only he can. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was in a very good showing as John Blake, though how certain he was that Wayne was Batman struck me as a little off. For Gordon not to know with large amounts of face time between both sides of Wayne and Blake to know immediately...it wasn't badly written, just made Blake look exceptionally sharp. Which is likely how the character was intended to be. I did buy him as both an officer and a detective, as did Batman, who took him in almost immediately. I liked their banter and even though the character wasn't 'Robin' as seen in the comics, he was a fitting helper to Batman and one that had his trust. Blake had a triumphant final act, as he was charged to save as many citizens as possible while facing military opposition. Levitt was the standout in a stacked film, as his character gained strength as the film went on. The finale, while in reality three separate endings, was his shining moment. What better compliment to the strength of an actor than to (presumably) place him in line for the next film? Of course, the direction of the franchise remains to be seen and it wouldn't shock me if this canon was disregarded completely. I hope that doesn't happen. The action scenes, especially the fights between Batman and Bane, are jarring and large. That's the moment I wanted to see, and it came much earlier than I expected. The epic showdown between the stars. The nods to Bane's actions in the Knightfall storyline - using Wayne's long layoff being the catalyst for his failing to succeed, goading Batman into a fight he wasn't ready for - these provided the same feeling I had reading issue #497 some nineteen years ago. I felt the time Wayne spent in the prison was a bit bloated, I know that he needed to rehab his back and literally climb out of hell but it did take some time. That's my only real issue with the film, the five months that Bane ruled the city and Wayne suffered in prison seemed lacking as there was no pressing of time. Wayne is successful in making the impossible climb and as he suddenly - and without any type of explanation - reappears in Gotham, the time scale materializes. The final act simply didn't have it for me. Miranda Tate's sudden turn and quick demise did nothing for me, which is why I haven't mentioned her character. Marion Cotillard was fine in her role, but her character disappeared suddenly and I was forced to embrace this new role and back story without the time to fully accept it. By the time I did, she was gone. Batman's ending made sense by the forced ending of a trilogy. Killing two characters while giving a suitable explanation as to how Wayne survived was okay, I had a lingering feeling throughout that Bale would not truly die. Didn't seem appropriate. The act gave Batman brought his credibility to a wounded city, while I assume Wayne would not be mentioned again. Bane's death was anticlimactic, he was moments away from killing Batman when Kyle silently drove up and shot him. The blast would have killed anyone, so instead of an epic end to the villain he was just quickly disposed of. These small issues I had with the film did nothing to lessen its impact, my eyes were glued to the screen both the first and second viewings. For the final film in a trilogy, the plot points were nicely wrapped up and new characters successfully introduced and ended. At the base level, the film is very complete. I have jumped around in my review but in closing, I loved nearly every moment and am fully happy by what I saw. The actors couldn't have been better, Bale is Batman. For all I'm concerned he will be Batman."
tt0102926,"The silence of the lambs is a hugely overrated movie. I can't believe it beat movies such as Boyz n da Hood, Thelma and Louise, and Fried Green Tomatoes for best picture! That is crazy. Horror movies almost never win the best picture Oscar and when one does it's the silence of the lambs?! This isn't even a very good horror movie. There are many more horror movies WAY better than this. This one is just okay. There are other movies other than those three I mentioned released in 1991 that are way better than the silence of the lambs too but maybe less classy which made them be seen as less Oscar worthy to whoever decided on what Oscars went to who. This winning best picture for 1991 is a huge injustice. Like how Chicago won over The Pianist. And how Shakspeare in Love won over Saving Private Ryan."
tt1130884,"I read the novel so I knew the story going in, and I still got chills in several places and really was moved at how incredibly good this movie is. I won't get into the plot, because that could spoil things, but Leonardo DiCaprio investigates a missing patient/inmate in a top-secret island fortress for the criminally insane. He keeps getting frustrated as his interviews with doctors and patients raise more questions than answers. Ben Kingsley, who plays the primary doctor on the island, deserves a Supporting Actor Oscar nomination, and we will see how far the rest of the cast and movie will go into next year's awards.The best comparisons for me were the Shining, for the psychological horror aspects of both movies. And a little bit of Silence of the Lambs, when the hero goes into a row of cells to talk with one of the inmates/patients. DiCaprio is good, but not up to the level of a younger Jack Nicholson, who would have been absolutely brilliant in this part when he was in his mid-thirties.I am not sure if someone who hasn't read the book will be confused by some of the story... or simply be blown away at how it unfolds.I have seen all of Martin Scorsese's movies and this is one of his top 5 or 6, better than Cape Fear, Aviator and the Departed but a hair below Goodfellas, Raging Bull, and Taxi Driver.This is a very scary movie, the truest horror film Scorsese has ever done. I can't recommend it to my wife or otherwise squeamish viewers, there are too many terrifying moments for them to enjoy it.What a great movie, I will surely see it again in the theaters. Haven't seen one twice since the Hurt Locker, and before that one it's been 10 years."
tt0102926,"After watching this movie, one can only imagine Hannibal Lecter waiting around the corner for them in great anticipation. Yes, this movie has a creepy theme to it that is usually saved for B-grade horror flicks, however it works very well in this intelligent and thought-provoking film. Hopkins performance was one of the ten best I've ever seen. Demme's direction was almost flawless and kept the viewer feeling disturbed throughout the film with his use of uncomfortable situations (ie- someone following you in the dark, being stuck in a well, being locked in a room with no way out). What struck me most about this film was the glorification of Hannibal which seemed to portray him as a good guy even while the viewer knows about his murders, cannibalism and mind-manipulating. I felt good about Hannibal getting free, which really disturbed me.A must-see and must-have for one's video collection. 9/10 stars."
tt0068646,"Maybe it's a generational thing, or I simply just don't get it, but The Godfather was bland and boring from start to finish. The story is hard to follow and lost me several times along the way. I felt emotionally disconnected from the movie and constantly found myself checking how long was left. Although the acting can be very good in some parts, the acting in other parts is downright terrible. It does not live up to the hype, for me."

tt0372784,"To start off this review I'd like to go back to the original batman series. Adam West hammed it up in what has to be the campest yet enjoyable version of batman. It was cheesy, it had the POW, WHACK, KABOOM, very very tongue-in-cheek which, brings me to my next point, is what batman eventually became. Batman, featuring Michael Keaton was a good film, keaton was a good batman, he portrayed the dark knight to a whole new army of fans, a darker batman, less camp, plus with a villain such as Jack Nicholson (turning in another great performance) as the Joker it was win win. Where from there? A sequel, Keaton yet again, Batman Returns, not as good as its predecessor but still a thoroughly enjoyable film with the villains being Penguin (Devito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) adding something different to the batman series. All is going well, then things start to go sour. Keaton is gone and in comes Kilmer who has to be the most wooden Batman ever, in come the clich√©s, the tongue in cheek one-liners and so on but Batman still has some credibility until, dare I mention it, Batman & Robin. This ruined the Batman series with Clooney just being the eye-candy for the ladies, the addition of Batgirl (oh dear Lord) and the villains just coming out with the most tongue-in-cheek one liners ever, example Mr Freeze ""You're not sending me to the cooler"", wrong, oh so wrong. Something had to be done and this was Batman Begins. This film rescues the Batman series single-handedly, it's a shame it didn't start off this way as it might not of died on it's rear. Bale is an inspired choice as Batman bringing a more serious side to Batman, the story is well paced, it's not all talk or just mind-numbing action, it actually keeps you gripped as you want to find more about Bruce Wayne's past. The only reason it misses out on a 10 is the quite pitiful bad guy scarecrow If you've not seen it I don't want to give too much away about the story but throw away all your perceptions about Batman because Batman is back and Batman has truly begun. D-man."
tt0429078,"I can't believe how some of the viewers thinking works today... some believe that we watch movies just to see something without imagining it ourselves? what?! has the IQ decreased really so much over the years, I mean that definitely was not the reason why the cinema was invented in the first place and why people are watching movies at all, if we can't imagine or in other words use the brain, we can't feel the suspense, we can not predict or form our own ideas and feelings about characters and situations, that would be very boring experience watching movies. If you want just stupid entertainment where's everything just spelled out for you, don't watch the real movies like this one. Even Hitchcock believed in the power of imagination, which is one of the most important things that allow us to be creative, there's lying the essence of the art itself. As a matter of fact, a lot of films offer certain portions of imagination, simply put, if there was none i would be just reading books, but the movies always try to incorporate some of that to get closer to this potency of the books. This movie is even more vigorous and successful in it and most of the people grown up on the Hollywood generic movie-making seem to be very confused and find it very hard to get used to this eccentric new film-style.My point is that the film Seven Swords is just a brilliant example of an absolutely challenging cinema! When you decide just to pass through the film without paying attention to little tiny details offered to connect with the screen or imagining what you don't see like in reality you'll obviously find the film very boring. This film offers the reality possibly unlike any film you've seen before, the reality is not as clear-cut and obvious, we also are not part of every event happening around us, there are not always explanations to what we see in reality. That's the biggest strength of the the film and the reason why it's leaving several paths for the viewer to solve out something what's not on the screen. Don't come to this film expecting a mindless entertainment, in all probability you'll just end up bored and confused. Keep in mind that this is a pure art that demands a certain effort from the viewer to connect with the given reality of the film and help you to properly appreciate its merits.First of all the action sequences were probably the most creatively shot in a very long time, something what can not be surely compared to what you still see nowadays. The stylistic way how are shot certain scenes is undoubtedly far ahead of our time. What's very impressive about the fight scenes in particular is the given exuberance and richness in its complexity, each movement of the warrior was connected to the essence and limitation of the particular sword but also each sword was clearly resonating with the personality of its holder. The unique strength of the film is also the visual stylishness that incorporates the jagged, disorienting camera and editing in order to create the confusing reality especially in the middle of the furious fight (with the camera right in some characters face or even under the water) so as to give the feeling as if you were part of the actual fight to the point you'd feel the attacks, pain and sweat on yourself. This was close to the most realistic fight scenes that were ever filmed.The movie absolutely exceeded my expectations, it's already one of the best epic films i've ever seen in my life. Thus far i can go here because Seven Swords is a film one of a kind that you don't see every year and as a moviegoer grown upon the most essential martial art films in Asian history, i can fully assure you that you will hardly find better martial art film in terms of the character development, visual virtuosity, art direction, story-line. It's easily one of the best films out there... get it! 10/10"
tt0167260,"In short, a very, very good film which would have been the trilogy's best and have gained a 10, had not it not gone on so long. I get the feeling Peter Jackson didn't want to end the series, and so made the final film last as long as humanly possible. In the end it just gets tiring.I really will not be watching the extended version, which may well stretch to five hours. Why couldn't they just do a Kill Bill on it?Oh well, I don't want to try to put you off, at 7/10 it is still well worth a watch, just don't try to watch the whole trilogy at once. Not without a family-sized KFC bucket, at least."
tt0993846,"The movie was way too long, and way too hyper. It may have been realistic but it was painful to watch because everything was cranked up to 11 and nobody in the movie was likeable. I couldn't find a way in and I found myself annoyed by the whole thing. Perhaps that was the point but it seemed like it could have been half as long and toned down a notch to achieve the effect it was aiming for. It was a movie I had never seen before but I was intrigued about as it was always a topic of conversation and was often referenced in popular culture. Well now I've seen it and it wasn't for me. I'm not sure it's for anyone really."
tt0120815,"The first 25 minutes or so is something extraordinary and I don't know how Steven Speilberg pulled it off. The first 25 minutes is basically a war battle but if you really think about it, the amount of technical detail you have to put in it is extremely difficult but it is not just the technical detail that makes the scene amazing but you feel what the men are going through and in some cases make you feel like you are actually in the battle. When Wade dies it is very disturbing and hard to watch but it is also very powerful. The plot of the movie is to bring Ryan back home to saftey because 3 of his brothers have died in combat so a group of soldiers are out looking for him. Tom Hanks gives a incredable performance and I found him once again extremely likable. Tom Sizemore is surprisingly really good and so is Giovanni Ribisi. Edward Burns, Adam Goldberg, Berry Pepper, and Jeremy Davies are also good and hold their own. This movie is also good at representing it's soldiers more as ordinary people as oppose to a soldier with no flaws and all he thinks about is serving his country. I am not gonna lie, I cried at the end of this movie when Cpt. Miller dies and that is because I grew attached to his character. The character of John Miller is a teacher and just wants to go home and he is forced into a position he does not want to be in. This movie is about characters in a awful situation and seeing how these characters react to war. Many people point out not giving the other countries a huge amount of characterization is a flaw but I personally viewed it as how we view other countries when we are at war and our perspective on them. Great war movie and this is one of Steven Speilbergs best."
tt0133093,"Really, my summary says it all.It's a cute premise overwhelmed by its need to be cool at the expense of plot, characters, meaning, or consistency. It has philosophical and literary pretensions that come off as kindergarten philosophy at best and ham-handed at worst. Luckily, these can be ignored fairly easily.Good action sequences for the most part. Most of the cast is summer-movie capable. i.e. Their acting is neither embarrassing nor impressive. Keanu gives his second-best performance ever (after Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure). Unfortunately, that is likely merely the convergence of his naturally confused look with the confusion inherent to the character.All things considered a fun action movie provided you don't buy the hype telling you that it is so much more.By the way, stop with this one. This movie is watchable and complete in its own and is only degraded by its truly dreadful sequels. If this movie is the triumph of style over substance, its sequels are the cruel beating and maiming of substance by style gone bad."
tt0167260,"If I wasn't a Lord of the Rings convert before this film, The Return of the King surely cemented my belief that if a film is good enough, even my stubborn preferences and opinions can be swayed.  Hell, it didn't just prove this fact, The Return of the King was so good that this statement can practically be etched into stone tablets and not be displayed in front of government buildings.I had the distinct pleasure of seeing the extended versions of the first two installments in the theater in the ten days leading up to the day The Return of the King was released, a first for me, as I had not yet seen either of them on the big screen.  Not only did I see these films in the theater, but I saw them with real fans of the films, which made the experience a lot more fun and interesting for me, and was just one of the many factors that made me truly excited to see the final installment the morning it was released. Only a fantastic film could create this kind of excitement in me ¬ñ not only did the film have two strikes against it for the hype and for being a fantasy film, but was additionally handicapped by my stubborn inability to remember the character names and back stories.  Yet I still walked out of the film in a daze because I was so in awe of its superior quality.Peter Jackson, who I have admired on a small level since seeing `Heavenly Creatures', continues to amaze me.  Where did this guy come from?  To go from making small, interesting and fairly weird films to directing the biggest blockbuster trilogy since `Star Wars' and doing it THIS WELL simply amazes me.  I say this with the greatest reverence and admiration as the most cynical and probably pickiest `film person' I personally know.  Another factor that stuck out for me was the acting.  Look at most big budget blockbuster action films and pay attention to the acting.  If you respond with `What acting?' that is pretty much the best way to describe most action films.  For example, when I went back and saw the re-release of the Star Wars Trilogy in the theater, I was dismayed and amused at the same time by the terrible acting.  The Lord of the Rings trilogy does not suffer from poor acting; rather it is enhanced by the good acting of its principals.  I think the enormous number of characters and therefore lower amount of screen time than other nominees may prevent an Oscar win for acting, but if The Return of the King or Peter Jackson is shut out for this film I will be very surprised.  I rarely support the huge films for Oscar wins, but I have a feeling that 2004 will be a well-deserved exception.The Return of the King is definitely in my top ten favorite films of 2003 and is only second to `Kill Bill Vol. 1' as my favorite action film of the year, words that I never thought I would be saying and words that could only be said because Peter Jackson has provided such an exquisite and superb film.--Shelly"

tt0172495,"Summer blockbusters are creatures of their own, aiming to cater to and exploit our lowest desires. Ridley perfectly understands this and consciously tries to redefine them when he gets a chance. Unlike many others, he knows what he is doing and approaches the matter with care instead of force. This works only because of him.We have a movie about a spectacle, in which we and the mob are one and the same. It's cynical as it bashes the industry and us, yet hopeful with its vision for the future. The visual style is novel and somewhat counterintuitive. Typically, one would expect huge cinematic battles, filled with bloodshed, as well as a very architecturally dimensional Rome, filled with pride of its history. Here, these are handed very differently, casually placed in the background. We imagine and deduce them from the eyes of the characters - very subtle, especially for a summer blockbuster. Instead, the focus here is on emotion and tension. Tension between a ""cheap entertainment thrill"" and ""strength and honor"". Judging by how successful this was, new endeavors should learn from it, as it shows that the audience expects something more.Crowe is utilized well here. Some of his scenes with Joaquin carry and project that tension for us to feed on.4/5 - Worth a watch. We've started to demand much more after this."
tt0315312,"During her divorce, Dr. Lila Coletti (Gina Gershon), a criminal psychiatrist, loses custody of her two daughters, partially because her job working with the criminally insane is dangerous.This has everything necessary to be a good thriller. But yet, it just comes off as boring. Gershon's mouth is horribly distracting and Sean Patrick Flannery is a decent actor but such a horrible human being that it is hard to focus on his performance.Most disturbing, this film takes its name from a classic film noir. Yet, it has no connection to it, makes no nod to it, and is a vastly inferior film."
tt0468569,"I am really astonished reading all the commentaries and the incredible average mark of the film. This movie is simply deceiving.When I first saw Batman Begins, I really loved it. From then I began to investigate more about Christohper Nolan and his films. I discovered also that Memento was directed by him, as well as Insomnia with Al Pacino and Robin Williams, highly interesting thriller placed in Alaska.Back to ""Knight"", I found it firstly too long. I went with 3 friends and all of them slept the whole last hour.Secondly, and probably the most important from my point of view, the plot is not surprising and of a quality you wouldn't expect from such an expensive movie.More, Christian Bale is not the same. In that film Batman as well as Bruce Wayne are poor, somehow sad, definitely not inspiring. Nothing comparable to his performance in Psycho. All the action scenes are the same, batman knocking and slamming with its legs, arms and fists. Where is the intelligence and slyness? The highly praised Heath Ledger is not bad, but the character, this new Jocker is deceiving again. Not fun, not subtle nor ironic, simply violent.To finish with, this film is too long, unnecessarily complicated, and if you see the images of the trailer, you have seen it all."
tt0372784,"This film easily trumps any live-action incarnation we've scene of the Dark Knight before, borrowing heavily from both the comics and the Dini and Co. animated series. This is a hard, fast, driving, heartfelt epic that draws you into the character of Bruce Wayne and makes you damn well care. Batman doesn't play second-fiddle to the villains here like in the other films. It's his movie and that's the way it should be.Much has been said of the film's ""reality"" quotient, and I'm here to say it works. Nolan talks about how Batman's strong because he does push-ups, he gets around because of his gadgets, and by introducing each of them with a plausible explanation, we forget to quibble and go along with it. The technology may be fantastic, but it's believable. And, unlike the ""reality"" of something like Daredevil, Nolan doesn't forget his ideals halfway though and start having Batman wire-jump thirty feet into the air."
tt0816692,"INTERSTELLAR (2014) ***1/2 Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Mackenzie Foy, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Wes Bentley, David Gyasi, William Devane, Leah Cairns, Topher Grace, Timothy Chalamet, Brooke Smith (voice of Bill Irwin) Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's valentine (of sorts) to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (and to his daughter) continues his streak of audacious sense of space (literally) and the inner human spirit : set in the bleak future Earth is on the descent of humanity with continuous food demands and climate change with one Hail Mary of a plan by NASA - send a small crew thru a wormhole (just go with it) to see if 'they' can help us. A grand ensemble of talent assembled but it is truly a shining moment of cool-as-a-cucumber and deeply felt performance by McConaughey as the astronaut/pilot of the journey into the realms of desperation, anchoring the film with a transfixing turn (largely due to his interplay with young talented actress Foy as his daughter - later played with clear-eyed intensity by Chastain), no easy task with all the eye candy visuals that are indeed awe inspiring and a kissing cousin to GRAVITY for sheer amazement (one must see it on a big screen and IMAX would be a start as it was filmed in the medium). Hathaway has a few moments as well particularly with her brainy scientist dad Caine (a Nolan regular). The true stars are the breathtaking cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, a stellar score by frequent collaborator Hans Zimmer and fantastic visual effects by literally dozens of geniuses. The only stumbling block is its slightly heavy handed message getting across but the Twilight Zone-ish final act makes up for it in spades. WOW!"
tt0993846,"Martin Scorsese at his undisciplined worst.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is 90 minutes of glib satire stretched over an interminable 180 minute film. I get it, I get it -- the excess of the film itself matches the excess of the Wall Street world depicted in it. But excess, both as a subject matter and as a style, is boring after a while. The first hour or so of the film blows the roof off the joint, and I was sure I was experiencing a film that would go down as one of Scorsese's best. But as it went on and on, and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance became more and more histrionic, and the film made the same point over and over, I had that depressing feeling that comes when a movie you're really enjoying makes a wrong turn and becomes one you really dislike.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is of course critic proof. Anyone who doesn't like it is instantly categorized by its fan boys as stodgy and unable to handle the subject matter, as if it's an impossibility that someone could dislike the film simply because they don't think it's any good. Whatever. It's an overblown mess, stupid when it's trying to be funny (the Quaalude scene, for example) and in desperate need of someone who had the balls to tell one of America's greatest directors that he was letting his material run away with itself.Grade: C"

Although it was wasn't my cup of tea, this thriller movie is enjoyable from beginning to end even if you're not into those type. It is a slow-paced film but it gets intense after a while so patience is key and the acting in this movie made it far more interesting, especially Anthony Hopkins' and Jodie Foster's. Personally, a 7/10 but could be an 8 the next time I watch it again."
tt1375666,"I walked into the theater knowing relatively nothing about this film, and I walked out...knowing even less. From the moment it begins to the moment it ends, you will be wondering what is going on. These initial questions are simply because those trailers we've been watching all year have hardly prepared us for what is about to happen. Most of us just buy a ticket on our faith in either Christopher Nolan or Leonardo DiCaprio. (In my case: both.) As the movie progresses, your questions grow deeper, more layered, just as the dreams you are viewing excavate the furthest reaches of the unconscious. It's an absolute ride, and in IMAX, it's astounding.It's easy to see how this is the product of Nolan's work in Memento. It deals with the same issues of our narrator's reliability and questions of reality. Both main characters have a tragic self-awareness that seems like a plus in the beginning of the movie, but by the end, you'll wonder if what they trusted to be true and what you trusted to be true is even true at all. Like the dreams themselves, the plot lines and characters begin to fall apart, but our Architect, Christopher Nolan, is the one pulling the strings. This is a film that moves beyond its medium and pulls you in. I'd almost say it breaks the fourth wall without even trying to.It goes without saying that the special effects are one of the highlights of Inception. This will probably be The Matrix of our time, but in a much subtler way. As Dom says, ""It's only when you wake up that you realize there was something strange."" This strangeness is embraced and pulled throughout the film. However, the mazes, infinite staircases, and alternate realities these special effects create are not limited to just providing an aesthetic wonder, but they serve to symbolically reinforce many of the main issues of the film. The paradox of an infinite staircase will be itching your brain for a few hours after you finish watching.The performances are pitch perfect. I initially thought that the characters were a bit one- dimensional and not incredibly developed. Don't be alarmed though. Nolan hasn't lost the touch that created his Batman and his Joker. I believe there are deliberate reasons for this lack of background, which will surely feed into the theorists that will begin sprouting all over the internet after this weekend. Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard provide the emotional and narrative center of the film. Being the Oscar winning and nominated actors they are, these roles are played beautifully. It's as if they don't even realize they're the ones we're all focused on.I would've given this a 10/10 if it weren't for the excessive use of Hans Zimmer's music. I'm a major fan of Zimmer's work, but I believe music in a film is instrumental when trying to give your audience some sort of cathartic release. At the moment I needed that from the score, it had already been playing non-stop for an hour, so it really made no difference in my emotional response. That's my only complaint, but I'm a film score nerd so don't worry about it.I'll end this now before I start confusing myself even more. It's a privilege, though, to see an auteur like Christopher Nolan working today, using the summer blockbuster as his medium. You'll leave the theater feeling as if you just ""witnessed"" something."
tt0167261,Peter Jackson is one of finest directors in our time with a magnificent adventure he took us to middle earth. It has a very good beginning in the first film although this one didn't take the story any where near its purpose although it has an outstanding preform ans from very big stars but it wasted our time with three hours took us nowhere.

Kramer signs up for the AIDS Walk but runs into trouble when he refuses to wear the ribbon.""I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!"" is one of the most underrated lines from this show. That whole scene is absolutely perfect and really makes the episode above average.The other aspects of the episode are a bit more average in my opinion. The metaphor between the Sponge and the AIDS scare is clever but gets a little too on the nose at times for my taste. I would have liked to see more plot surrounding the rift between George and Jerry regarding ""being cutoff"". But oh well... Still a solid episode."
tt1853728,"I saw Django Unchained with the expectation of any Tarantino fan. But I left shaking my head in disappointment. This is not a bad film, but I'm not saying it's a good one.The length of the film is one of the main flaws. There are many scenes that do not serve a purpose to its characters and story. Which leads to its pacing problem. These irrelevant scenes exist in the film that often slows it down. It is very unbalanced.Mostly, it's the characters and performances. Many are giving praise to Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio. Waltz, first of all, is in similar territory when he was in Inglorious Basterds. He and his character served their purpose and Waltz was just fine in the role, but nothing to highly praise. DiCaprio as Calvin Candie was nothing worth noting. Either its in the performance or the script, I never really invested in him. It's as if Tarantino wanted to write a great movie villain and that's what DiCaprio took as his only direction. There is a scene where he gets the evil monologue, but it comes very forced with ultimately ends up destroying the character.Jamie Foxx, first of all, was the right choice for Django, but I believe that Tarantino did not trust his protagonist. It takes a long while to get invested in him, but at that point, why bother? BUT, the standout for me was Samuel L. Jackson. He takes his character Stephen is able to go beyond the material that is given. There is fun in his performance which is what the film should be.I am well aware that I will be in the minority, when it comes to disliking the film. How people will try to tell me that there was more to the story than meets the eye, how it's a great revenge tale, how the characters were great and well written etc. But this is not a good Quentin Tarantino film.The film is too long, with characters that hold the most minimal of interests. I will be really dishearten to see this film receive awards and praise. Maybe it's the love of Quentin that will jade people. I know it will. But after coming out of a strong year for film, Django falls flat.The movie lacks the confidence of character(s) and story in a hyper active world. It loses it's identity somewhere along the line and the little scenes of greatness cannot save it. Most of all it does not have the joy of film that often add life to Tarantino films."
tt0167261,"It's a movie about walking! That's it. It really is one of the worst, most boring and tiresome films I have ever seen, and I've watched loads of films! I do not know how they managed to make the film this long with not much storyline to it. I would not recommend this, there is no point to it.I can't say much more about it as it is walking, more walking and a ring. I think how they made 3 films about the same storyline is beyond me. I think the books were just as boring, and can't believe the publicity they have got of how 'good' they are, they are not. The effects, set and acting is reasonable, but that is nothing if there is no storyline."
tt0167260,"I have enjoyed the LOTR trilogy as much as anyone, but the computer graphics got a bit out of hand for my tastes in this one.  The sets are fantastic, but they could've worked a little harder on the special effects to make them seem a bit more real.  Aside from that, I wonder how someone can easily breath sulfur gas, wonder why stories must be so tidy, and remember that intermissions are a good thing.  I loved the film, but a few things make it less powerful than the first (which I rank the best of the three), but a magnificent film and story, nonetheless.  Bring dinner and a pillow.  8 of 10"
tt0848228,"Honestly, I like the odd superhero movie but the makers of this are like the fat kid in Willy The Wonka who has to have all the chocolate.This production (sic) treats the entire audience as low IQ zombies (no offence to actual zombies intended). There is zero depth of character development and zero story line interest. At no time whatsoever do you ever feel a sense of suspense or danger. At no time do you care if any of the characters come to harm - well you kind of know that none of them will as their superheroes - obviously. And why even bother having humans with no super powers - Oh I forgot, the humans in it are the most magical, unbelievable fighting machines. They just stand there wasting anything in their path, and Im not talking about the super heroes here. Rambo is but a beginner compared to them.Every single facet of this farce is totally predictable from start to finish. Its one of those where you pray your transported to another reality and the bad guys actually win.Technically its all good except the sound department have again gone mental. The action scenes are incredibly loud and were at times quite painful on the ears (seriously) and then the speaking parts were often so whispered and muffled sounding. I'm sure during post the sound guys sit there with the best sound system money can buy - but the reality is their mix doesn't translate well across systems. Bad sound isn't the problem, its the post mixing. I hear this issue on far to many movies these days and its ruining many films.The acting by some of the cast is decent, considering the ridiculously poor script they have to work with. But in no way will any of them be remembering their part in this movie during their twilight years. This is a money and profile job - nothing more. Even then I do have to wonder if putting your name to this is actually worth it?. The directing is amateur hour. His/her (I don't know and don't care) focus is squarely on action and FX - so why not just have the FX team direct it as they certainly would have done a better job than the lucky ducky who managed to land this lucrative job. I do wonder if the director has actually ever watched a movie to see how one directs actors?Anyway, I cant say much more about this nonsense except if you enjoy a movie which is one long mind numbing boring action scene, aimed at a dumbed down populace - then this is for you.PS I cannot believe this movie gained so much favourable reviews. I certainly smell a rat."

And can anyone want to defeat the bad guys without killing off the family? Hollywood, AGAIN, fed us another movie, filled with special effects, and a used up story.

tt0110912,"Tarrantino did what he set out to do in Pulp Fiction ¬ñ- making a wacky, nonlinear piece of entertainment full of gratuitously over-the-top dialogue (or monologue) and violence. He made that clear even in the title; it's just a highly charged but disposable fiction. He succeeded quite nicely.However, many his fans are trying to make it more than what it is, a cool but undemanding movie. While it's refreshing compared to typical banality supplied by mainstream Hollywood, it's far from a truly great classic some fans want people to believe. Interestingly, that's probably not Tarrantino's intention in the first place"
tt0068646,"I re-watched it today. My rating reflects that I feel it is over long, and not as vital as it may have seemed to audiences in 1972. Parts of it, in fact, are actually boring. Other scenes, particularly where their is action or violence, seem dated. On the plus side, Brando gives a mostly fascinating performance, and some of the supporting actors are also quite good. I especially liked Robert Duvall and Abe Vigoda. Apart from the acting, their is one section of the film that I did find riveting. It is when they prepare Michael to kill The Turk and the police chief. It is tense and suspenseful, and is the closest the movie comes to noir."
tt1853728,"I tried to like this movie but I didn't.The ""story"" is really weak, only a pretext to show pointless violence that someone finds funny (not me).Waltz was OK but I didn't like his character. Foxx character on the other side is really awful. The way he behaves is really annoying and the fact that he becomes a skilled gunman in one lesson only is really unbelievable.The only actor that stands up is Di Caprio, but the violence he enjoys is similar to that of far fetched rated-18 horror comics; maybe teenagers finds that entertaining.I expected a surprising movie I found a boring and pointless one."
tt0110912,"I don't deny that this film is 100% entertainment and the dialogue is solid gold; but that would be nothing without the terrific actors. To be honest, I think the screenplay is massively overrated (although it is commonly cited as one of the best of all-time). It generally mixes ideas from lesser known films and used irrationally to create an ambiance of cool. Though this film is wonderfully cinematic, it must've been tremendously exciting back when it first premiered. I think its exploitation of violence and drugs is a tragedy, and although these consequences do lead to something bad, it doesn't disencourage them. I can't help but resent the film for the fact it's usually the film that gets people into film (can't disagree that it was one of the films for myself, but it has been 7 viewings since) since it offers absolutely nothing new, it just doesn't have a point nor is it a realistic representation of anything - not that I'd like to know, to be honest. If it wasn't such a cult film none of the images would recur. It has a pretty flawless soundtrack though. However, I cannot discredit a film for being overrated and what this film does preach does not offend me. I completely understand the acclaim it gets.8/10"

My girlfriend on the other hand thought it was great, I think she used the word ""impressed"", it impressed her I don't know maybe I am just one of those love-the-original-movies guy. I still have to say that Batman with Michael Keaton was great. Can somebody explain to me who really killed Bruce Wayne's parents? I mean was it Joker or Joe Chill?

tt1375666,"There is no doubt that Nolan is a very talented director, and I like a lot of his films, but sadly I think like a number of other hugely successful directors before him (Peter Jackson springs to mind) his success has led to a detrimental degree of freedom for him to churn out his own poorly-written scripts unchecked, and make films that are about an hour longer than they need to be.I know I'm swimming against the tide of public opinion here, but while I was hugely excited about seeing Inception back when it came out, I was absolutely crushed on first viewing. I found it terribly written (the film begins with enough exposition scenes to fill a normal film's running time!), incomprehensible (editing was all over the place, action dull and repetitive), visually disappointing (all the best bits were revealed in the trailer and were all contained in the exposition scenes rather than having anything to do with the story) and with a concept that just didn't hold water (the dream sequences seemed to always resemble Matrix out-takes and were held together by a logic that just wasn't very dream-like)!Perhaps if Nolan had a studio breathing down his neck and someone to revise his shaky script this could have turned out well, but after the success of TDK he can effectively write his own ticket and is (sadly) free to churn out this kind of lazy and self-indulgent snooze-fest. The same thing happened with Peter Jackson after LOTR with King Kong (an hour too long, too much freedom etc.)Hans Zimmer's incredible score was about the only positive I took out of Inception (Zimmer's brilliant scores are increasingly the glue that holds Nolan's films together and makes them seem better than they are). Despite his obvious talents and love of film (I love him for shooting Batman stuff in IMAX 70mm!) Nolan has some very bad habits (mainly relying on his and his brother's writing) which I think really hamper his films these days. I loved TDK, but it frustrates me in almost equal measure, and though I haven't seen The Dark Knight Rises yet, I will go in with very low expectations based on his apparently dwindling form."
tt0133093,"Hackneyed, muddy plot. Fishburne is reduced to spouting Zen platitudes and comments about the Net as poorly-reasoned as Al Gore's recent gaffes. The film is basically an excuse for the special effects, and the best that can be said for Keanu Reeves is that he wasn't any worse than the character he played in ""Johnny Mnemonic"" (or is that ""Moronic""?)"
tt1130884,"Its so slow without any twists you could not have guessed and tons of over acting, to the point I was laughing in the serious scenes. The end dragged so bad it was hard to care about the characters anymore.Could of been alot better. Like maybe try actual suspense and not suspenseful music mixed with lots of shouting and crying.... and so many flashbacks it gets really really tedious.Reminds me of sixth sense or fight club in that it was over hyped and the end was extremely obvious, whether or not a person guessed it is the only reason to like it or not like it. If you didnt figure it out youll like it, if you did figure it out youll be shouting at the screen 'get it over with already!'"
tt0875595,"We don't get Turkish films in Australia, apart from the odd festival piece. We have to wait for the DVDs to arrive or to be sent by relatives. I have just seen Kader.How interesting it is that characters and reviewers alike talk about Bekir's love for Ugur. In every culture, there is a degree of confusion where love ends and obsession begins, but in my experience it has always been a particular Mediterrenean/Balkan disease. The director, very skillfully, conveys that in an environment where all conviction is hopeless dedicating a life to a person makes as much sense as any other formula for living. Bekir's obsession for Ugur intensifies because of, not despite, her rejection of him. However, the film is much more than a doomed love story. It is at once an exploration of alienation of youth, a study of roots of violence and a critique of machismo culture. Bekir's character reminded me a line from a well-known Turkish poem: ""Like a pain without a body / seeking an organ to attach itself"" (my translation, my apologies to purists). In reality, the line applies to all the major characters in the film. Much criticised ending is perfect, in my opinion. I cannot imagine a better way to end this important addition to modern Turkish cinema."
tt0108052,"Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan share similar questions: in the former, how much money is a life worth; in the latter, how many lives is a life worth? Very good questions, and Spielberg ham-handedly beats a response out of us in each film. He employs two story-telling techniques, both to the utmost extreme: visceral sensationalism and morbid sentimentality.To turn the focus on the movie being reviewed - Schindler's List uses a horror film approach to movie-making to keep us properly frightened and cowering in the corner. At some point it stops being about somber remembrance and turns into a gruesome series of predictions: he'll be shot - he's too overly sympathetic; he'll make it - he had too much screen time to be executed; she'll die - the violin telegraphs it... and so on.Spielberg's greatest sin is that he underestimates his audience. We don't need to be bludgeoned into three minutes of silence. The atrocity was great, and sixty years later the wounds are still painful. All we need is to be simply ushered into a fresh realization of the holocaust - and Schindler's story is a particularly poignant way to accomplish this.At some point during the movie Schindler speaks of true power - the ability to pardon. Yet Spielberg drags this movie past the three hour mark, emotionally executing each and every viewer. My edit of this movie would have excised the sloppy and insincere sentimentality, and spared (pardoned) the audience so many streams of blood that the scenes lost any impact the victims' deaths might have contained. (not to mention, my edit wouldn't try so hard to convince that all women in WWII slept topless!)I also fault the movie for setting Schindler up as Jesus Christ (we're bought with a price!). I'm still trying to decide if Spielberg wants to insult or convert the Jews he is sympathizing with. After Schindler dropped his cross... er, ring in the sand I half expected him to be crucified for war crimes.I give the film credit for a tremendously impacting ending. We see, and can truly honor for enduring hell, the Jews whom Schindler saved.For a properly restrained and truly honoring treatment of the topic of the Jews during WWII, watch Episode 9 of Band of Brothers. Thanks for that anyways, Steven."

I wasn't really enjoying them.Every dramatic moment was being thrown away because it was filmed as a close-up.Over and over again, the epic context was stripped away and all we got was big, blue eyes.People say they liked these films, but I don't think they know what they are missing.I sat there disappointed as each great moment in these stories passed by without soaring to any great emotional heights. It was flat as cardboard."
tt1345836,"The Dark Knight Rises is the third and final installment in director Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. The story takes places eight years after the events of the last film, eight years since Batman vanished into the night and assumed responsibility for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent in the hopes that it would benefit the greater good. But when a new villain threatens to destroy Gotham City and cannot be stopped by law enforcement alone, Bruce Wayne is forced to adorn the black armor once again.The film introduces several new characters: John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young police officer whose loyalty lies in doing what is right and not blindly following his superiors. Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), a cat burglar working for Bane in hopes of obtaining a device that will erase a person's criminal history and giving her the chance to start a new life. Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard), who encourages Bruce Wayne to rejoin the rest of the world and continue his father's philanthropic work. Loyal butler, Alfred (Sir Michael Caine), Commissioner of the Gotham Police, James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and genius inventor, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), also make a return to help Bruce Wayne become the Dark Knight once more. A new villain also enters the fray that is just as intelligent, resourceful and a better combatant than Batman (even breaking Batman's back at one point, depicting a classic scene from the comic series) ‚Äì Bane (Tom Hardy), a terrorist portraying himself as a liberator of the people.Production staff really outdid themselves in making this film superb in every detail. In regards to the dramatic aspect, filming took place in several different cities across the world including New York, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, London and Jodhpur. By amalgamating different cities, staff members helped to make his imagination of Gotham resemble the description of the city given in the comics. Costume specialists helped to give Bain the appearance of a lucha libre (masked wrestler), which coupled with his resourcefulness and intelligence helped to create the perfect villain.The Dark Knight Rises takes place in an apocalyptic time with nuclear warfare threatening to destroy Gotham City. Cinematography experts helped to reinforce this doomsday ambiance by having Bane and his henchmen blow up all the bridges that lead out to the city, trapping the entire police force underground and unleashing the hooligans from the city jail in a scene that resembles the ""Storming of the Bastille"". The federal government also abandons Gotham, leaving the people of Gotham to fight the battle on their own. Even scenes that do not take place in the city show the helplessness of the times. When Bruce Wayne is imprisoned in foreign jail, Bane decides to ""torture his soul"" by having him watch the events unfold in Gotham on a television set while he is trapped in a virtually inescapable prison.Director Christopher Nolan stated that this film would mark the end of his interpretation of the Batman trilogy. However, the end of the film leaves the viewer with a final surprise: John Blake's legal is revealed to be Robin John Blake, a reference to Batman's comic book sidekick, and inherits the Batcave after Batman's ""demise"". This leaves the possibility open to an additional installment in the Batman franchise, and with the critical and financial success of the series, it may be a smart move for Warner Brother's to make (copyright owner's to the series).The film also leaves the viewers with a final message: a hero can be anyone. Whether it is placing a reassuring grasp on the shoulders friend, letting him know that things will get better, or helping a stranger on the side of the road who is having car troubles. Nolan's final episode is an earnest attempt to give a deserving end to a much-loved series. With cool gadgets, fast-paced chase and fight scenes, complex characters, and a story line that will keep you on the edge of your seat, fans of the Batman series will not be disappointed."
tt0381429,"I saw a screening of this in New York City in late March, and I loved it. I thought about this movie for many days afterward, and it is one of the best films I've seen all year. It is scheduled for an October release.This was a beautiful, poetic film- one that touched me both on an artistic level and a deeply personal level. Although I am forty-five now, the movie took me on a vivid journey back to my own adolescence, and the truth that Ms. Shortland captured about ""Heidi,"" and the relationship between ""Heidi"" and ""Joe"" was breathtakingly realistic.Somewhere during my viewing, I realized I was watching one those rare works of art which so startlingly and accurately paint a piece of the human experience that is both reflective of its time and place and destined to transcend them. ""Heidi's"" red gloves become the self-protective coat of armor to an Aussie teen-aged a girl of the twenty-first century the way ""Holden's"" red hunting cap served the same purpose to the confused, distraught adolescent of 1940's New York City.The acting is superb, and there is not a false note anywhere to be found in any of the elements of this film."
tt0848228,"The movie was absolute trash. Horrible scripts, least menacing villain ever, no chemistry between the actors, and mundane story line. The movie was immensely over hyped and definitely does not deserve anything near a 8.5 rating. Its alright as a kids movie. It does not come anywhere near the unprecedented standards set by the dark knight or for that matter does not even come close to spiderman 2. The movie is often commended for its humor. In my opinion the humor is extremely dry and futile. Nothing special at all, despite its box office success it would have been better off as an animated movie. So if you want watch at least a decent super hero flick you might as well pick up Watchmen, X-men first class, Spider man 1 or 2 and of course the batman trilogy."

tt0111161,"I really enjoyed the movie .I really was a little bit bored at the first hour and how things get a little bit too much the same thing but everything accelerate after .So we follow two guys charged for murder and both of them live in prison . And we see what happened and how they try to stay strong despite the problems . We know that Dufresne was not guilty but it get there anyway .And the life in prison is a little bit boring but what i really enjoyed are these relationship moments and how they stay together with jokes and they helped each other like a family .Dufresne got a chance to maybe clear his name by a testimony but the director of prison is corrupt and they killed the guy who could save Andy and it was shocking and we felt that injustice .But the big moment its when we know that Andy had made a holemto get out of prison and it was unexpected . We felt like Ellis ( the funny thing is that from the beginning Ellis seemed to know everything and when he get worried about Dufresne that he could do something wrong we get the same worries ) so yeah we get fooled in some ways and that freedom moment in the rain was very well made .Friendship,injustice,Justice are some big themes in that movie . And i really love that they talked about the life before prison and after too . The talk about some prisoners who cant get used to society anymore because they have been in another condition that dont fit in that kind of living so we see the death of that old man and the redemption of Ellis who moved on in life with a new business and project with Dufresne and i really like that opposition of fate about Ellis and the old man . And reinforce that friendhsip was really important .A very nice movie and keep up until the end : you will get surprised about how things turned and about some dialogues who have another meaning ."
tt0114369,"Wow. There are a lot of bad films out there, but even with the worst of the worst there is some redeeming quality, like that neato big wave in the Perfect Storm. But Se7en? The acting is flat (Brad Pitt's opening lines seem like they're coming from someone acting for the first time, his moaning at the end, when he gets his special gift, just seemed pathetic); the script is not at all inventive and unsuccessfully covered up by hyperbolic special effects and redundant gore. The ""twist"" at the end is hardly disturbing because the writer/ director have been shoving gimmicky horror effects down the our throats for the entire movie.People who like this film- the dark, urban atmosphere, the pseudo-noir elements: please watch some David Lynch films and see how this should be created, i.e. not by using video game titles, not by relying heavily on special effects, make-up, and yet ANOTHER plot with biblical references, but instead by a careful selection of actors, beautiful cinematography, and incredibly original stories.Stop funding this director so that he will go back to making TV commercials instead of two hour long theater commercials."

It's got very unpleasant atmosphere and imagery. Who are these movies made for? They are disgusting. When you watch this you feel as if you were bathing in manure. Is it supposed to be the development of cinema and taste of the audience since Chaplin movies? I'd rather keep with the old Chaplin ones.One disgusting occurrence goes into another, then - another, and so on until the list of the deadly sins is over. This flick deserves to be a piece of entertainment for bored hit men, who can later discuss ""the head in the box"" with their buddies (remember ""Max Payne""?).If a movie is artistically weak and leaves an empty feeling - all because of some fiction created by somebody, what's the purpose of it all? I should also mention that many years ago I considered this movie to be wise. And of course I wouldn't bother to write a review, but, damn, it's on the top 250 list, which is depressing.Watch our ""Stalker"", ""Ostrov"", or ""Solyaris"" if you want a clever film dealing with sins. That's all I've got to say.1 out of 10. Thanks for attention."

Tarantino has that second degree and his movies don't have to be taken literally and he did bring a whole new genre to cinema, and the technique and the music is amazing, and the actors are good, and the image is good, but... At what point does all of this just become a lame excuse to do another violent movie filled with clich√©s and empty of content. Really???? This is a movie about slavery?? It seems to me that it is in fact yet another bullshit excuse to portray spectacular killings for numb-minded viewers who can only expect this from a movie. Nothing makes sense in this movie, absolutely nothing. And it is the same as all the last Tarantino babies. It is better then kill bill and Inglorious Bastards, but what isn't? And overall it they are all exactly the same. Is there nothing else we can expect? Is this all folks? After almost a century of cinema we did everything there was to be done?

tt0109830,"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.10/10"
tt1853728,"I just saw this film and I confess that I am completely satisfied. I am not an admirer of Tarantino but I have little to say about this film, inspired by a character from the sixties western-spaghetti films and mixing western with blacksploitation. Tarantino's style (exaggerated, showy, extravagant and excessive) is all there before us, but unlike other films I didn't feel that this was a problem or transformed the film into a kind of parody.The plot is about the search that Django, a former slave who is unexpectedly released and becomes a bounty hunter, will do for his wife, a slave who was sold and disappeared. He has the help of a German, responsible for his release. Together they discover that she is at the home of a rude slave-owner called Cotton Candy who, among other businesses, profits from death fights between slaves. So they decide to disguise themselves as experts in the field to go to his plantation and try to buy her freedom without Candy realizing what they want.The film is very good and, despite being almost three hours long, it has no dead moments and entertains wonderfully. However, although Tarantino's exaggerations and histrionic vision were not a problem this time, there are some points that were really uncomfortable, mainly concerning historical rigor, which, we already know, is not something that he really takes seriously (another reason why I don't like him as a director). To begin with, such Mandingo Fights never existed. We are not in Ancient Rome and the slave owners, however bad they were, did not like to throw money out the window and kill for pleasure their best pieces! Tarantino went to get that silly idea from another film he liked and pasted it here. Another problem is the use of dynamite, which would only be invented a few years after the period in which the film takes place. The clothes also do not match the time or place of the action. The outfit of the Club's black maid, with that miniskirt, is particularly bad in that it sexualizes the character and imports a 21st century scent into the middle of the 19th century. I will not go on much longer, I think I proved my point. Another thing I have to say is that this is a very violent film, Tarantino style, that is, with a ton of blood for each bullet, spectacular shootings, some nudity and high doses of brutality. The dialogues are also full of racist insults and profanity, but I think that was something the film asked for, in support of its own credibility. In short, this is not a movie for anyone. With Tarantino, this is often taken for granted.The main role was given to Jamie Foxx, and he is superb and gives the character a strength and toughness that I liked, and which contrast nicely with the polite sensitivity of Dr. Schultz, brilliantly played by Christopher Waltz. This actor had already done an extraordinary job in ""Inglorious Bastards"" and now he was even better, with a character that seems tailor-made for him. I was particularly impressed with the work of Leonardo Di Caprio, who rarely manages to make villains. He is an actor with a rare talent and has managed to be worthy of our contempt in this film. Another actor who shines in this film is the veteran Samuel L. Jackson, in the role of a black butler so fond of the owner that he becomes more slavish than whites. I also liked the brief cameo of honor of Franco Nero, the actor who played Django in the original films. It was an elegant and honorable way for Tarantino to bow to the actor and the work that inspired him. Much less impressive was the performance of Kerry Washington, who has little time and material to show what is worth.Technically, it is a film full of notable aspects that require our attention and that, to a large extent, are part of the director's brand image. It is the case of cinematography and the use of strong colors and slow motion footage in action scenes, features of a strong visual style that Tarantino loves. The sets are good, and also the costumes despite the anachronisms that I have mentioned. The film has a pleasant pace, but the first half was generally better yet more restrained: it seems that Tarantino gets lost in his own style as he approaches the most violent scenes. The soundtrack is great and takes advantage of several songs by various composers. Personally, I enjoyed listening to the original song from ""Django"" by Luis Bacalov, and the songs composed for this film by Ennio Morricone, a name that will always be associated, in collective memory, with the great western-spaghetti of the past. It was a careful, effective and honorable selection in the way it honors the genre."
tt0848228,"When I saw previews and commercials for this movie, I got really excited. I was a big fan of the old 70's Lou Ferrigno Incredible Hulk show. I loved Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk and the 2008 Hulk, so I knew Hulk would make a big impact on everyone who saw Avengers. Tony Stark was just flat out hilarious. 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger was not the greatest Marvel movie. I still liked Cap. America, but I just thought it was too in the 40's (kind of boring). I loved the Thor movie because there was great fun action in almost every scene (like the Avengers). The Avengers tops every Marvel movie I've ever seen and I can't wait for the September 25th Blu-ray/DVD release! I LOVE THE AVENGERS!! It might be hard for The Dark Knight Rises to top this film."
tt0110912,"Fasten your seat belts we are about to enter the dark realm of hyper hype. I just don't get it. I have seen a lot of movies and this one....well, I am far off from the norm (of ratings). A 4 out of 10!First off, I don't like how the violence is glorified. Vince and Jules are just too cool. HEY,PEOPLE THEY ARE KILLERS! Movie fans treat them like fans of Mickey and Mallory in Natural Born Killers. WOW, THEY ARE COOL AND FUNNY! BRILLIANT PERFORMANCES BRAVO! (DUDES). In this picture show, the good guys are ruthless, mean, brutal, murdering outlaws and they do it with a twinkle in their eye. Not realistic. I am amazed at the number of people who love this movie. It must be the phenomena of when you tell drunk jokes to a drunk; they love it.I am not one of those pristine few who believe that movies should have no violence. Many of favorite movies are violent.The part where Travolta blows a guy's head off is not funny to me nor is the one with Jackson and Travolta killing people in the beginning. The drug overdose with Uma and the needle slamming into her chest is not funny or entertaining and yep, I always laugh and watch rape and sodomy for entertainment. Jackson and Willis are the highlights in the movie to me. They give a little moxy to the flick but they can't save it. I did love seeing John Travolta returning to the dance floor (very clever), but it was not enough to keep this movie ""stayin alive"". The movie ranked up their with professional wrestling. I almost had to kick my own ass for watching all of it. I pulled the plug on this one before it made a vegetable out of me.The plot is anemic. The violence is the steak and the plot is not even a baked potato side order. The plot clings to this Hollywood entree like wilted parsley. In the end ,just like food, it all does come together and should be flushed down just like last nights supper.If I had to watch it again I think I would get a blow torch and some pliers and get medieval on some pulp video."
tt0068646,honestly one of the most boring movies I've ever seen! i would've enjoyed it more if it was shorter. i really don't get how its one of the most talked about movies of all time. i rated it 5 after watching but i'm giving it a 3 now. and i'm pretty sure i'm never gonna complete the second and third films.
tt0172495,"The expectations of this film are enormous,, given the hype and popularity surrounding it since release. The acclamation accorded it is , no doubt, explained in part by cinema audiences having been starved of Roman epics for so long. The same phenomena influenced the hype of many early 90s westerns, few of which merited serious attention (Tombstone and Unforgiven)Anyway, to return to Gladiator the viewer must always be wondering where is the plot, the story?. This is not a movie for the impatient, however, neither is it a movie for a patient viewer seeking true immersion in the story. The story is simply too ponderous. I always felt that I was watching a film and perhaps this is the worst crime any film can commit; the failure to let the viewer escape into its world and pretend for a period that this (the story)is actually happening - now and that he/she is a privileged witness to the events.None of the actors provide their characters with more than one dimension. Russell Crowe looks superb in the stills but in motion he  delivers no more variety of emotion than Dirty Harry (or worse Chuck Bronson in the Death Wish series!) Oliver Reed provides the few positive moments of feeling and passion.Mr Phoenix has 2 superb scenes as he murders his father and later when he threatens his nephew's life. Both are powerful, although the former is derived from Bladerunner - when Roy Batty crushes the skull of Tyrell.In the end we have a film which tries hard; delivering top stars; strong cinematography; an action charged setting but ultimately lets itself down by spinning a boring yarn. For a more entertaining version of similar events see The fall of the Roman Empire (1964)."

tt0993846,"I recently watched The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) on Prime. The storyline follows a young man in New York who excels at day trading and quickly rises through the ranks to amass great wealth, eventually starting his own company. As he becomes more affluent and successful, he draws the government's attention for his activities. Can he elude the long arm of the law, or will they bring about his downfall?Directed by the iconic Martin Scorsese (Casino) and featuring stellar performances from a talented cast including Leonardo DiCaprio (Django), Jonah Hill (Superbad), Margot Robbie (Barbie), Matthew McConaughey (Killer Joe), Shea Whigham (Splinter), Kyle Chandler (Super 8) and Jon Bernthal (The Walking Dead).This film boasts an outstanding cast, mesmerizing performances, sharp dialogue, superb narration, and features beautiful women throughout, alongside unbelievable circumstances that capture the viewer's imagination. Every scene within the office setting is mind-blowing, making you yearn to be part of that extravagant lifestyle. While the ending may be somewhat predictable, as all good things must eventually come to an end, especially illegal ones, DiCaprio and Hill's dynamic chemistry shines through. The supporting roles played by Robbie and Chandler are executed flawlessly, and the cameo by the actual Wolf of Wall Street at the end adds an intriguing touch.In conclusion, The Wolf of Wall Street stands as another masterpiece by Scorsese and DiCaprio and is an absolute must-see. I would give this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it."

tt0114369,"Inspired by the Divine Comedy (there are other religious books that inspire the villain but i don't remember them), the psicopath John Doe (Kevi Spacey) tries to teach a sermon by torturing people based on one of the seven deadly sins they are accused of committing.This movie biggest sin (pun intended) is that only became a masterpiece that it is known only half way through it. The first hour is a generic detective movie with all the clich√©s: the two cops who are opposite from each other(Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt), a murder mystery, etc.But aside from that, it's a great movie worth watching specially for the twist at the ending."
tt0361748,"Previous Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing. It isn't Inglorious, its disgusting.I absolutely hated Inglorious Basterds. The entire point of a film is to entertain - if u call bashing people's heads and removing their scalps entertaining!!!! - and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie can commit, it is extreme boredom or disgust.The movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring and disgusting scenes of people talking at tables in various languages. There is even one scene where 3 people talk for nearly 45 minutes at the same table, before, thankfully they are all shot. I wished they would have been killed off after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to shut the F**K up.This table talk style is a Tarantino hallmark, but in other films, I actually cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking. Here, I couldn't care less. All of Quentin's films display an enormous confidence, particularly Jackie Brown. But here there is a pervasive feeling in every scene, Tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film.Is it violent? Sure there's torture and scalping galore, but you'd have to remind me. Thankfully, the film was so thin, I didn't even remember I had seen it earlier in the day when until I saw a review headline on MSNBC.He's out of gimmicks and apparently dying to write a novel. But do us a favor QT and spare us the movie.I walked out of this movie halfway through and I would never recommend anyone seeing it no matter what a die-hard quarantino fan he or she is.I give it 0 / 10."
tt0468569,"I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film. It was always going to be good, and sadly, it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorses.It is rare though, that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. Nolan (The Prestige, Begins) delivers on more than the Joker we remember from the 'Old Days' of Burton and Nicholson. Instead we're given a psychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy.All the hailing of Ledger's performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than you'd remember from any other film. It's impossible, quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars, makes you laugh at his sick jokes, then makes you instantly wonder why you're laughing.If Ledger wasn't enough to horrify you - wait for Harvey Dent. Brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart as Gotham's 'fallen White Knight' and Batman's direct counterpart. His transformation will put Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal look like children's breakfast cartoons. Gyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both Bale and Eckhart, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batman's 'conscience' and of course, Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid.There are some major differences between The Dark Knight and Begins. Firstly, the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the 'majestic but unfinished' tones of Begins - but it suits the film's tone: Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain (compared with the many in Begins) - but there was also a lot more henchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more efficient - as mentioned in the film, learning through experience.I was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film, it just felt like a loose thread and wasn't quite closed up or explained, and the ending, while it wasn't what I expected (others have said that it was predictable, but for me it wasn't) was solid and suited the film well.All in all, this is a film that is quite close, if it isn't already, a masterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous 'Superhero' adaptations (Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example), there isn't campiness creeping in. In face, if Batman Begins was 10/10, The Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply, the best possible sequel that could've been given.If you watch this (which I implore that you do), you certainly won't regret it. One of the best movies of 2008 (I'll wait till Quantum of Solace comes out before I pass judgement) - but certainly a film worth getting excited for. If you don't like it, then that's also fine - but keep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good movie, so the rest of us won't take it to heart.Stunning in every aspect, and exceeds all hype and expectation... Can't wait to watch it again, or for the Blu-Ray!"
tt0468569,"When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made."
tt1853728,You may want to wear a shield for this film cause it is bloody as hell. Like other Tarantino movies it is a guilty pleasure.
tt0068646,"The story is disjointed, the acting is terrible (especially Corleone who sounds like he's got a stick up his ass), the film is too long, the wedding scene is almost perpetual, which makes me ask, how did this get a 9.2? I'm shocked to be honest, what an awful, awful movie this is and I don't say that a lot about movies since I tend to appreciate what they are and what they are trying to convey, but this? This is an embarrassment and has to go down as the most overrated movie of all time in my book. There's no good acting performances in the movie, no memorable lines, no excitement, nothing. I'm genuinely disgusted that this movie has such high accolades because to me, it's crap. Absolute crap.Brando's portrayal of Corleone has got to go down as one of the worst acting performances I've ever seen as well. The accent he uses is difficult to understand, the scene where he's shot in that assassination attempt is laughable as he over dramatizes the whole thing and his general acting performance and portrayal of Corleone, who is supposed to be a feared crime lord, is contrived and doesn't look believable. I'm honestly shocked that someone who is rated as one of the best actors who ever lived can perform this badly. This is the first film I've seen Brando in so I think it's unfair to judge his ability as an actor based on this poor performance, but my expectations will definitely be lowered when I watch another movie and see him as part of the cast."

tt1345836,"CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS, BUT YOU SHOULD NOT REALLY CARE.I rarely write reviews - but after watching the over-hyped brainwash epically named The dark knight rises - i felt compelled to do so.Beware this movie was dreadful in every single sense possible. Besides, it shattered an image of Christopher Nolan as such an outstanding director for me personally.1. Story This movie is a painful attempt to compress a ridiculously long story into a three hour running time. The basic idea to do so is a surefire way to failure. TDKR consists of a thousand cleverly mixed bits and pieces, which make the plot running, but at what price ? Pathetic plot holes covered with computer effects and glazed in ""epic-ness"", shallow characters, lack of logic, clich√© dialogs (to say the least).2. Characters Where they came from? Who they are? Their motives? Their feelings? Their beliefs? You see nothing. Only hints. How do they communicate? They exchange clich√©s and aphorisms. Gets on your nerves after watching half of the movie. Most reviews say that Catwoman was pretty good and believable, well, i just personally, do not stand women kicking ass - it's men prerogative.3. Batman Batman is not a Batman in it's traditional sense. Wayne overcomes eight-year depression in a couple of days and (wow!) he still is in great physical shape - and without any special preparation turns into a commando. He overcomes all the difficulties, out-plays the police, the military, the whole country, beats the bastards, rides the cool battleship - and saves the WORLD!4. Villain & the threat Bane visually was quite impressive, despite the weird voice, yet the context in which he was put completely diminished the power of a character. He safely lives under the city in the sewage, training a giant army ? I mean, one professionally trained police squad could stop him in real life. He walks around as if police snipers do not exist - just imagine him walking out on the stadium field in real life. Next moment you know it - head shot. Well, script writers thought otherwise. A reactor, which could be used as an atomic bomb? Built right under the center of the city? Oh, c'mon - how stupid is that? You can make an epic movie without a pretension for apocalypse. Miranda ? Who the hell is she - she appears a couple of times on screen and in the end turns to be the head of the whole operation. And what happened to the police ? Giant town is guarded by just a bunch (it is said 3000 people, but looks like no more than 50 or 100) of disorganized cops. Military guys looked even more pathetic.5. Emotions Movie tries to manipulate audience to experience certain emotions, but fails with the only exception - it really makes you tense at times. Romantic story between Miranda and Wayne looks more like a cold one-night stand. Sadness and parental love coming from Alfred towards Wayne seem so forced - i persuaded myself to believe it. Robin's background is not entirely explored and doesn't provoke that much empathy as the director probably have expected.6. Music I don't know who's responsibility is that - i believe an extra sound engineer for a movie would do the trick - the never-ending music just drowned out the voice all the time. With all the respect to Hans Zimmer, the accompaniment would suit a medieval battle movie much better.7. The ""Epicness"" Everything in this movie, starting from the setting and going up to the music is so overly EPIC - it just becomes plain boring after the second hour.Movie tries so hard to exceed all the expectations - it just becomes obvious. I would rate it two out of ten, just for the attempt and the amount of work involved into it's creation.Do not believe the hype!"
tt0172495,The only Oscar it should have won is for art direction and effects. The script is very simple and predictable. Actor's performance is very weak. Russell Crowe acts like Stallone in Rocky (poor performance)and Joaquin Phoenix is not convincing as Roman emperor.
tt0120815,"Yes, the opening beach scenes are very dramatic and mighty, quite moving, but the actual story is sentimental and corny. The worst thing for me, though, by far, was the final scene in the cemetery - this isn't a spoiler because the film has been out for so long now anyway. Ryan's final salute and words of gibberish don't go anywhere near, in my opinion, expressing the depth and profoundity of the experience. It's so sloppy it actually makes you want to vomit and I question here why Spielberg, at the final moment, allows the superficiality of nationalism to take precedence over humanity. It's as if Spielberg is saying Ryan is first and foremost an American before he is a human being."
tt0708125,"Cesar Romero and DeForest Kelley are the big draws here.Colonel Martinez (Romero) wants to steal a Gatling gun and then go to Mexico to overthrow Maximilian.Luke is the target as he is transporting the Gatling gun to a Fort. However Martinez has hired some rough mercenaries one of them being a disgraced US soldier Clarke (Kelley).When news reaches that Maximilian has fallen. Clarke and his cohorts plan to use the gun to rob a bank. It leaves Luke to somehow stop the gang.Romero is rather sympathetic and honorable as Martinez as he travels with two Mexican ladies.Kelley is rather bloodthirsty and bitter. He does come to the aid of one of the women when she is being harassed.A good example of episodic television of that era, luckily Luke has help just in time."
tt1345836,"Christopher Nolan's new film fails in terms of plot and directing.It has great visuals but it remains just a action movie, nothing more.It's not like Dark Knight anymore, a movie that makes u connect with it and feel the situations.This one is just an action packed movie nothing more. Bane's performance is not good enough ! sometimes u can't even understand what he's saying through his microphone, Heath Ledger killed it with Joker but Tom Hardy fails to create a character for Bane.the film won't even let it's own actors to feel their situations.because there is a short scene and then the next one starts, a very fast paced movie that doesn't live up to the standards of dark knight or other Nolan works.I think this must be one of his worst movies to date."
tt0422272,"I just saw this movie and I must admit that I was very pleasantly surprised. The plot is about a nurse (Flockhart), taking a job at a ""soon to be moved"" children's hospital. Little does she know of the rather strange and spooky events that have been happening there. If you like a movie that knows how to build an atmosphere, movies like The Shining or The Others, you cant do wrong buying a ticket for this one. For me, being a person who almost fell asleep during The Darkness the quality of this movie was even more of a surprise. The acting is a little over the top at times (Flockhart), but as a whole The Fragiles is a well acted, well directed, beautifully shot thriller, and that little girl has eyes that just make you go ""aaaawww how sweet"":). I give this one a 8.5/10"
tt7286456,"Take Taxi Driver and King of Comedy (and maybe a touch of Falling Down), mash them together with only a basic idea of what made those movies good, and use a popular comic book villain as the lead in order to get far more recognition for the film than it would have gotten otherwise and you have Joker.Joaquin Phoenix may have acted the hell out of the title role, but it doesn't change the fact that Joker is at best a pale imitation of far better films that actually knew how to make a point with their social commentary.Phoenix's performance and the cursory Scorsese like visual aesthetic may have tricked others into seeing depth where there isn't any... but not me. I really wish I hadn't wasted my time with this one."

Well...a little wouldn't hurt...and it'll never be as funny as the 1966 batman's version. The scarecrow part is not useful, so why bringing him back ? The part with the cell phone's sonar is lame, so lame you could cry... The end makes no point at all, and Bruce Wayne's sacrifice is just pointless. Well, maybe a tiny bit better than ""batman begins"", and the music is sometimes not annoying, these are the only good points. Ledger's interpretation is OK, but not well served by the rest, and the character of Twoface is too ""cartoonesque"". The balance is then pretty bad.I don't think there is any possibility in the near future to propose something comparable with ""Batman's return"", please stop trying !"
tt0848228,"I'll preface... I'm not a comic book reader. I enjoy fantasy, as long as it makes sense in its own self-created universe (Star Wars and Trek, Harry Potter, Superman). But the Avengers is awful, and even worse considering how highly rated this junk is on IMDb. It has a couple moments of delight (but so did the Phantom Menace), and the effects are state of the art, bar none. But, this is the 50th movie in a row where the photorealistic effects impressed me. Now, I'm afraid I need a real movie to use that CGI to good effect.The Avengers fails for me due to the character combination. I didn't read a single comic book, but Universal released this huge budget movie knowing they will need to attract 10 new people for everyone who read the dusty old comic books. The Avengers are a dumb assembly of heroes. Captain America is an idiot character. He is from a different time, isn't good at anything modern (like why is he barking orders?), and has no powers whatsoever. Ditto for Black Widow and Hawkeye. I mean, the latter shoots friggin arrows. Cappy had a shield and punches guys within 5 feet of him. They are just plain lame. Thor is a GOD and the Hulk is invincible. They're immortal. Unstoppable. And Iron Man, with his impossible-to-believe suit which might as well be magic-based is also nearly invincible. Who needs the other 3? Why isn't Spiderman in this group? Or some of the X-Men? As for the humans, why do we have a city-sized aircraft carrier? That flies and looks amazingly like the big aircraft from Avatar? Why build a ship that flies? Okay, now the plot. I don't get it. This movie is 2:22 minutes. I don't even understand Loki's motivation or plan. Loki wants to blow up Earth? Why? Why do those Aliens/Clash of the Titans monsters want to blow up Earth? Why could Thor and Loki get to Earth but they can't without the magic portal? Are those monsters magical or technological? And that cube - seriously, they used the same lame McGuffin from Transformers. Which is a movie very much like this one. I mean that as an insult. What was Loki's plan, crumble the outer shells of buildings in NYC. Shoot a lot and not hit anyone? Not one human even seemed to get hit with all the devastation.I hated it. My wife and kids hated it. My 9 year old son hated it. That says it all. It made no sense, was utterly talky and boring for a huge chunk of it. The Dark Knight wipes its rear end with this blu-ray disc. Avoid at all costs unless you liked Transformers 3, John Carter and Clash of the Titans."
tt0261492,"OK, obviously this isn't WEST WING, nor did it ever set out to be. I only saw this because it was included with the movie DVD. That movie was worse than I remembered, and I had no expectations this TV show would be any better. I was wrong, and here's why:David Allan Nelson: yeah, the show is called SHEENA, but Nelson's is the more central character. We're lucky he is, because Nolin has no real charisma, but Nelson does. It's really the same character he did in DEATHSTALKER III (aka Deathstalker And The Warriors From Hell), with a better hairdo. He brings a good light-hearted sensibility to his lines, which nicely offsets the fantastic element of Sheena and her shape-changing.the writing: again, this comes down to comments made by Nelson (or occasionally Kevin Quigley), because Sheena's role doesn't really allow for character or humor. It doesn't help that Nolin's line delivery tends to come off snappish (at least, in the first few episodes; I'm hoping she gets better). This may simply point to Nelson's vastly longer resume. But it really says something when a TV show features a half-naked girl, and I'm still watching it for the bemused male dialog.settings: the exteriors look pretty good, and that is the vast majority of shots. Sheena's cave lair is mercifully rare. Think Star Trek caves. Yeah.The plots themselves are simply what you'd expect: some poacher (etc) comes to town (or rather jungle) and our two intrepid heroes defeat them. So far, that's each 43-minute episode, with a bit of padding from nature shots ... which sometimes include Ms Nolin washing off mud. Well, you don't get much closer to nature than that. This is Disney, though, so yes: they may push the edge of PG but don't go over.The CGI? Well, it's ... OK, this is just TV adventure, folks. The CGI is what it is. I've seen worse, I've seen better. It gets the idea across, and they don't use it very often.The bad: well, leave it to American TV to make a TV show that takes place in the African jungle, but only cast one non-white actor among the four regular cast members. Can you guess which of the four gets the least amount of screen time? (ding! I think we have a winner!)But seriously: for a TV show featuring white people in the African jungle who never suffer from sunburn, this is not so terrible as I expected. Ms Nolin herself isn't too bad, and after three episodes I have yet to see her run in slow motion, so that's already a step up from Baywatch. No, there's no realism, but for escapist adventure TV, this is surprisingly well-written and decently filmed. I'm not sorry I bought it."
tt0109830,"Not being Tom Hanks' greatest fan, I avoided watching this film for several months after its release. This also gave me time for the hype to die down a little - but on the back of all the press and several positive comments I was still expecting to sit down to enjoy a good movie.I was mistaken. My reward? Two hours of praying for the credits to roll to take away the pain.To me this movie takes pleasure in displaying everything that is wrong with the Hollywood film industry - America's need to rewrite history to suit its own needs, its desire to peddle the ""American dream"" myth and the rewards given blindly to any movie that does the above (in the form of several Oscars - could anyone please explain to me the exceptional qualities of the movie that put it above anything else released that year?If only Forrest had kept running... into the sea"

tt1375666,"Everyone has been telling me how this movie is so complex, so confusing. That you really need to pay attention or you'll get lost.I dosed off in the middle and still knew exactly what was happening.This movie is nothing but a cross between The Matix, Dreamscape, Mission Impossible and about 3 other movies and anime films that have been coming out since the mid 1980's. The ending was the most obvious outcome it could be, you already know he doesn't except the dream version of his wife so she would be gone. But the kids¬Ögetting home to see their faces again, they were the real focus. If you missed that in the beginning then seeing his father-in-law pick him up at the airport should have been the final tip off.Most people I ask about that missed it all; they couldn't even tell which dream was which. I think that's what scares me the most, people think this takes real intelligence to follow.Maybe if your attention deficit¬ÖOh wait I am and I still had no trouble following this over rated boring movie.I gave this movie 4 out of 10 stars for special effects only, for story line and acting I give it only 2 stars"
tt1345836,"I just finished watching the movie and the first thing I wanted to Google was, ""The Dark Knight Rises plot holes,"" because I COULDN'T be the only one who saw them all. Lo and behold, there were hundreds of people writing about them. I then breathed a sigh of relief that people were actually critically analyzing vs. blindly absorbing. BUT, then I went to this website and saw the movie rated 8.6 out of 10!!! The 46th best movie of all time??!! Are you fu*king kidding me??!! What a joke.The sad part is, I bet the people who gave it a 10 out of 10 don't even know what a movie plot is and what makes for a good one. I bet they have no idea what character development is, a movie timeline, logical event sequences, etc. They probably just see guns, explosions, car chases and fighting and thus rate the movie as EXCELLENT...I mean, with all those cool things how could it not be? (eye roll) This is one of the major flaws in a democracy, too many sheep get a vote.Batman Begins was excellent, don't get me wrong and so was The Dark Knight, but this one was not, it's that simply. They didn't even try. Just Google ""The Dark Knight Plot Holes"" if you want to know what I'm taking about. It takes more than cheesy action scenes to make a great movie...oh who am I kidding, if you gave the movie a bad rating I am preaching to the choir, if you gave it a great rating I wouldn't be able to sway you anyhow.To sum it up. The Dark Knight Rises was cheesy, illogical, ridiculous, unbelievable, and went against common sense...but, it did have some really cool graphics and fun toys. However, even if you did combine all the coolest machines and you placed them all in one movie, in the end, it never adds any depth of the plot, it just distracts from it."
tt0167260,"While it has more action than the first two movies, it dragged and dragged and dragged on. This portion of the story could have been told in 90 minutes: the other two hours are there merely to give your subwoofer a work out. The movie does accurately portray the book, which was also exceedingly boring. The story is not memorable. I couldn't remember enough about the first two movies to know what the situation was for the third movie. The highlight of the movie is the boost it gave to the New Zealand economy. It is also a great travel video for the South Island, enough that I may take a vacation there to see it. Don't waste your money on this, unless you need a good nap."

tt1130884,"Shutter Island, Scorsese's fourth film featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, recounts the unnerving of a U.S. Marshal with his arrival at the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane to investigate the disappearance of an inmate. The film is categorized as a horror film but falls more appropriately under the rubric, psychological thriller. Despite an all-star cast and a variety of technically adept cinematic features, the film falls short for a Scorsese work and even shorter for a horror film.Teddy Daniels, the protagonist played by DiCaprio, is partnered with Chuck Aule, (Mark Ruffalo) in this investigation. Daniels' own psychologically debilitated state is made apparent through recurring graphic flashbacks of his involvement in WWII and through hallucinations of his recently deceased wife. The film opens with Daniels vomiting on the ferry destined for the island, the camera following him under deck as he tries to gather himself. Such vulnerability does not serve him well at the outset and beyond and suggests possibly that he might some day be greeted as an inmate himself. Indeed, upon entry into the facility, he is welcomed by a setting of low ceilings and chains as if, in time, he might find himself, given this introductory psychological makeup, restrained by them. Such symbolism is only the beginning of what makes the outcome of the film remarkably predictable...To read the rest of the review visit: http://www.soundonsight.org/shutter-island-review-2/"
tt0111161,"None of the usual otherworld creatures that populate the works of Stephen King are to be found in The Shawshank Redemption. But the real world of that Maine prison has some bizarre rules of its own and there's a whole new reality within those walls.In the tradition of Cool Hand Luke and Birdman Of Alcatraz comes Tim Robbins who was a banker on the outside, but when he caught his wife cheating on him with a golf pro from their country club, he's convicted of putting eight bullets in them, four apiece and tried and sentenced to two consecutive life terms in Shawshank prison. Like Luke and Bob Stroud he works out his own rehabilitation and rebels against the prison system.He may be a con, but Robbins still has all his knowledge of finances and pretty soon he's made himself quite invaluable to the warden and the rest of the staff at the prison. At the same time he and the cell block scrounger Morgan Freeman develop a close personal relationship. In the end they beat the system in a most unique way.There have been some classic prison films made ever since The Big House at the dawn of the talkies. Two I've already mentioned. My favorite prison film is Robert Redford's Brubaker, but The Shawshank Redemption comes pretty close. As does The Green Mile which was also directed by Frank Darabont.Darabont got an Oscar nomination as did the film itself and as did Morgan Freeman for Best Actor. The Shawshank Redemption was in for a flock more Oscar nominations in 1994. A couple other good performances are that of James Whitmore the institutionalized con who is there for 50 years and paroled and just can't make it on the outside. He will break your heart as will Gil Bellows who plays a fresh, but rather likable young con who runs afoul of the warden.Speaking of which Bob Gunton as the warden will positively chill you with his corruption. You would have to go back all the way to the James Cagney classic, The Mayor Of Hell where Dudley Digges was the warden of boys reformatory to find a warden that is as sanctimonious and as corrupt as Gunton. This is a man who gives Bibles out to each inmate hoping that the reading of the Good Book will improve the moral fiber of the convicts. At the same time he's raking in money every which way he can and a rather special punishment is meted out to him by Robbins.The Shawshank Redemption may not have monsters and other worldly creatures that normally characterize a Stephen King story. But the world of Shawshank prison is bizarre enough for any normal person if you see this wonderfully crafted and acted film."
tt0361748,"What is the deal with this movie? I was bored out of my skull during this movie. I don't know if I missed something, but I thought this movie was terrible. I would also like to mention that I watched this in my home on Movies on Demand. I saw it with my dad and friend, and we all basically wanted to turn it off. The only reason we watched the whole thing was that when I finally snapped and decided i was done watching, the piece of garbage was nearly over. I see that it's high on the list of best movies of all time for IMDb ratings. This really does baffle me. I was not intrigued with the plot at all. The parts that were meant to be funny did not translate for me. I really thought this movie was lame."
tt0342804,"One previous review named inktastesbitter accused Susan Tom of exploiting the foster-care system and being in it for the money. I can't believe this. There are many, far easier ways to make money than having a 24/7 job caring for special needs kids. We can speculate whether Ms. Tom is, in caring for so many children, trying to fill some unanswered psychological need of hers. But that is surely pointless since the good she is doing seems to me undeniable.This is a marvelous, provocative film that deserves the widest audience possible. I am a college professor of philosophy. ""The human condition"" is of course one of the subjects of philosophy; I show this film to my students for all its insights into the joys, challenges, and heartbreaks of the human condition"
tt0120737,"Breathtaking. Unique. Captivating. Enchanting.Within minutes of the start of this first chapter of an undeniably epic trilogy, the audience was left gasping at the intensity of the images on the screen. And we had nearly three hours to go.The scope of Tolkien's masterpiece may have eluded film-makers for decades, but director Peter Jackson makes good on his promise: he has not only brought us the tale of Frodo and his bold companions, he has brought us Middle Earth. And believe me, it is BIG. Sweeping vistas and hang-onto-your-seat camera shots send us zooming through the towering cities and citadels of Tolkien's imagination.But even more impressive than the stunning visuals and sound- effects-like-you've-never-heard-before are the actors who breathe life into the characters. Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and Elijah Wood's Frodo is one of the most unexpectedly captivating performances I've seen in a long time. The despair, terror, and determination of the Fellowship is all there, in spades. I left the theater aching...from tensing every muscle during the fight and flight sequences--the breathless and compelling kind we haven't seen since Spielberg gave us a desperate charge onto the D- Day beaches of Normandy.Those unfamiliar with Tolkien's world may quickly find themselves lost in it, but happily so. The depth of his creation cannot be grasped in a few hours, and it doesn't need to be; the struggle of good against evil explodes on the screen, and leaves little room for complaint.The movie ended with a stunned audience sitting on the edges of their seats, feeling somewhat bereft. We were exhausted, but no one wanted to wait a year for more.Jackson's ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything you've seen this year. George Lucas and Chris Columbus take note: this is how you deliver on a cinematic promise."
tt0361748,"The whole movie's premise is about an off-branch of Allies military unit, who calls themselves Inglorious Basterds and kills Nazis in occupied France in the beginning of the fifties. I would have rated this movie even an eight or a nine, if it was all there was to it. However, the movie is divided in to a couple of perspectives: 1) Hansas Landa, a Nazi officer tasked to hunt-down Jews, whose primary attributes revolve around the fact that he is smarter than your ordinary Nazi and will show this in every-which way. Don't get me wrong, C. Waltz was the best thing in this movie, but his character for me personally was way too much; 2) Inglorious Basterds, who are taking their sweet time killing Nazis while barely getting a scratch themselves. Though, this is rectified towards the end in a shoot-out scene. We gotta have those! Even though, in the flash-backs we see how one of them just mowes down prison guards. Yeah...; 3) Shosanna - a Jewish girl, who in the past has escaped Hansas Landa and now is working as a cinema operator with a grudge against the Nazi occupant forces.I'm gonna be honest, this might be the least favourite Quentin Taratino movie for me. Much of it is a bore and slog and when it finally picks-up, it's almost at the end. And I did not like the ending much; what, everyone dies except Hansas Landa, who gets a second chance at life through blackmail? Get the hell out with this crap..."

How could I have missed out on this gem? That's simple, because it sucked. I probably did see it and just plain forgot. It's the typical cop mismatched partner movie who chase after a serial killer. Completely illogical script. Dumb ending with even dumber twist. Freeman, Pitt, Spacey and the rest did their jobs. Regardless, just a stupid story"
tt1375666,"I rarely post but felt the need after seeing the rave reviews on this film that I clearly disagree with. I felt obligated to vote to bring this score down to reality. I've read the terms benchmark, intelligent, masterpiece and greatest ever. After seeing the movie I find those terms and the current rating of 9.2 insulting. Yes for some reason I feel personally insulted by this. Is this because I was expecting the world after the great reviews and was truly disappointed? Was it the fact that I believe most feel the movie wasn't that great but are jumping on the bandwagon? I'm not the most intelligent individual in the world and can't understand how anyone intelligent could actually enjoy the story line with so many obvious holes. All I know is these layers upon layers of poor plots left a sour feeling in my mouth. I've read the comment and agree this is 'a smart movie for ignorant people'. They do say ignorance is bliss. Keep rating this ten you smart folk.Overrated, unengaging and far too long (let me scream that from the roof tops) are my thoughts. I paid top dollar to view this in my lovely electric reclining leather chair being waited on hand a foot in a 'gold class' cinema and I wanted to escape the comfort of my chair after 30 minutes. Long and painful movie experience. I urge you to filter through the positive reviews and read some well articulated negative responses. I have chose to keep this post short and sweet and leave the well articulated responses to the well articulated (lord knows every second person here thinks they are a literary genius). I really did want to post a 1 out of 10. I am a realist though and I have seen worse films. On a positive note Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were great. They boosted my score from a one to a three. Leo and Joseph finally went through went through puberty and were believable as adults. Give me back the 148 minutes of my life wasted watching this film."
tt0102926,"THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is, quite simply, a breathtaking movie. It's the granddaddy of all serial killer flicks, a film that even the almost-as-good SE7EN can only aspire to, a movie that gets into the mind and soul of a serial killer like few others. It inspired a huge sub-genre of similar movies that came out during the 1990s and 2000s, and it's up there with Hitchcock's PSYCHO as one of the most gripping looks at the subject matter of all time.Where to begin? There's a pitch-perfect Jodie Foster, gradually leading us into the depths of the storyline as the naive FBI agent, and the oft-overlooked Ted Levine who excels as the supremely skin-crawling Buffalo Bill. Of course, the film is dominated by Anthony Hopkins, giving the best and most memorable performance of his career in just 16 minutes of screen time. Hopkins chills you to the bone in this, and Jonathan Demme's direction is a perfect match for his talents.The storyline is engaging, ably mixing the criminal investigation strands with scenes involving the killers themselves. There are gory and monstrous set-pieces which make your flesh crawl while watching, yet it's all rather restrained and intellectual, a surprise given the subject matter. Most importantly, it's never less than gripping and completely frightening. A true masterpiece of a movie."
tt0230379,"Hammer's short-lived supernatural series Journey to the Unknown (produced by Anthony Hinds) only lasted about four months. 20th Century Fox acquired the hour-long episodes for American release and paired several of the episodes together and released them to both theaters and later to TV. This one contains ""Poor Butterfly,"" directed by Alan Gibson, and ""The Indian Spirit Guide,"" directed by Roy Ward Baker. For some reason original series hostess Joan Crawford has been dropped from the proceedings and instead we get pudgy, bearded charmer Sebastian Cabot, who briefly pops in to warn us, ""You'll pray for morning!"" In ""Poor Butterfly,"" Steven Miller (Chad Everett), an American businessman in London, receives an invitation for an unknown source for a costume party out in the county. He can't figure out who invited him or why, but travels to Measham House, a secluded manor that seems to be stuck in some kind of time freeze. There he falls for Rose (Susan Broderick), a young, frightened beauty dressed in a butterfly costume. She wants him to take her back to London with him, but various guests say ""I don't think they'll let her come with you."" The next morning, Steve discovers why. The highly predictable story involves romance, jealousy, an attack with a croquet mallet, ghosts and reincarnation.The better segment is Roy Ward Baker's ""The Indian Spirit Guide,"" which was scripted by Robert Bloch. Jerry Crown (Tom Adams), a hard up private eye having a hard time paying the bills, gets hooked up with wealthy, grieving widow Leona Gillings (Julie Harris), who wants to contact Howard, her late husband of fifteen years. Jerry specializes in uncovering bogus psychics, such as a man in drag (!) using tape recorders and lighting tricks and a turban-wearing Oriental mystic at ""The House of Chandu,"" who uses a floating trumpet on strings gimmick. Seeing an easy, vulnerable target in Leona, Jerry decides to romance, marry and then kill her for her money. But there's one more psychic that needs to be defrauded; Sarah Prinn (Catherine Lacey), one of Howard's close friends, who works through an Indian spirit guide called Bright Arrow (Julian Sherrier). Will Bright Arrow be able to warn Leona in time that she's in grave danger? Both tales are just mildly entertaining and received a TV-G rating on cable (suitable for children)."
tt0415193,"This documentary is another useless, slanted, armchair quarterback, hit piece on the bombing of Japan with two nuclear weapons in 1945.I tried to watch this movie with an open mind on the Sundance channel earlier today.The more I watched it,the more I thought,where have I heard all of this before?I was under the impression that this was a piece designed for high school students, and maybe university students, on the exploits of the horrible American government,and Harry Truman,and how could they do this to the Japanese people.This movie did not address all of the facts about Japan's activities in World War II.The filmmakers only addressed that America is an evil entity, that dropped two nuclear bombs on two Japanese cities,nothing else.War is not pretty for anyone,and the filmmakers are either extremely naive,or being disingenuous to the audience that they want to supposedly educate.The last straw came when they showed President Harry Truman and what he said at the time, and then guess who came next;President George Herbert Walker Bush.As far as I know President George H. W. Bush was not involved in world war II, and the decision to end the war with Japan by using nuclear weapons.As I see it,when you make a film about history,you should present all sides,not only the slanted, uneducated side of liberal hand wringers who have no sense of history, or solutions."

They flipped the usual idea and boundaries of good and evil for the audience to feel sorry for the bad guy. People seem to think this is a good thing. It's bad!The point of a movie is to entertain audiences and this movie just made me feel depressed and miserable.

tt0468569,"Ledger is irresistibly interesting in his portrayal of the Joker despite the somewhat hackneyed plot, and his performance saves the film from disaster. Without his performance I would have walked out as the rest of the film was trite, melodramatic, garbage.Christian Bale gives wood a bad name as he soullessly meanders through the role. The guttural growling he performs as Batman may make sense to the plot but its almost unbearable to listen to .The previous film with Bale a beaten down outcast and a man struggling for an identity was infinitely more interesting from an acting perspective than this film. Bale feels trapped in the role in this film going through the motions and he seems bored and unchallenged almost not knowing what to do with it. The plot also doesn't have the structure of the previous film. There was a appreciable beginning, middle, and end of the previous film that let things percolate, the action build, the plot be exposed.This film is too evenly paced and like an unstructured watercolor the plot runs together and gets lost somewhere along the line.(or maybe I just lost interest) I remember seeing a scene with the Joker in a nurses costume, and while the character was interesting not knowing or caring at that point why the Joker was blowing the place up.The Two-Face character was fairly weak, the emotions in the wronged Harvey Dent seemed forced and the plot explanation of his 'do-gooder' gone wrong personality seemed ham-fisted.Maggie Gyllenhaal was not a particularly interesting character and there were no fireworks between her and either Bale or Eckhart. Michael Caine almost seemed to be biting his lips to spit out the lines in the film. He seems to be almost embarrassed to be in the film.Acting wise the highlights are Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and of course Heath Ledger who you never doubt 100% inhabit their parts and actually add something positive to the film.Unfortunately they are fighting an uneven script, a hackneyed story, and bad acting from Bale and others the whole way.The result is an uneven, and eventually uninteresting film that relies on constant action and superficial delights to offset the uneven acting and flat out bad plot. Certainly inferior to its predecessor and without Ledger would have been an outright disaster.I feel a bit alone on this analysis and I am surprised as anyone about this as I was expecting greatness when I went into the theater. But thats the way the cookie crumbles."
tt0120815,"I read four or five pages of reviews for this film on the IMDb boards, and most of them fall into one of two camps - those who felt it was the best, or at least one of the best war movies ever made - and the Spielberg bashers who decry the very fact that America and it's Allies had even the slightest audacity to win the War. Granted, the concept of good Americans versus evil Nazis is a bit too simplistic when it comes to cinematic treatments. Those viewers who want to read so much of that into the picture are missing one of Spielberg's main goals - 'How do you find decency in the hell of warfare'? That question reverberates around the central plot, the mission to rescue a sole surviving brother who's three siblings have all perished in the same war already. For the eight members of the rescue team, the quandary is presented in terms of moral prerogatives - why potentially sacrifice so many soldiers at the expense of just one, who may already be dead anyway?Moral dilemmas abound in the story. Ed Burns's Private Reiben challenges Captain Miller's (Tom Hanks) decision to release a German soldier on his own recognizance to turn himself over to an American patrol. Private Caparzo's compassion for the young French girl in the bombed out town is seen by the Captain as a life or death threat to his unit, and must decide for the greater good of his men. Even when Miller's Rangers finally achieve their objective and find Private Ryan (Matt Damon), the situation does not play out in straightforward fashion. Ryan resolutely refuses to be 'rescued', instead seeing that alternative as abandoning his own men. By what right should he be so singularly absolved of his duty to serve and protect his country? My summary line above captures the essence of Miller's response and observation, knowing that his duty and his humanity are in obvious conflict.This conundrum creates another dynamic in the story, reverting back to the character of Private Reiben. When Ryan was anonymous, it was easy enough to dismiss him as some nameless, faceless soldier who didn't warrant any special kind of treatment. Up close and personal however, Ryan proves his value as a soldier in battle, side by side with Reiben in the German tank ambush at Rammel. These perspectives are not typical in your average war movie, and make the film far more interesting than if it had taken a more documentary like approach, as in the opening half hour of the film with the landing on Omaha Beach.Perhaps the most complex character, and the one I had the hardest time with was Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies). By virtually all of his responses to battle conditions and enemy encounters, he was an outright coward. His singular moment of bravery was enacted with some measure of revenge against Steamboat Willie, the German soldier who's life was spared earlier in the picture. Willie provided Upham with a reason to overcome his distaste for war, by abrogating an implied trust they shared over a cigarette. Upham had his reason and motivation to kill Willie, while allowing the remaining Germans to escape. For Upham, the war had to become personal for him to take action, and that's no way to survive in conflict.So for me, ""Saving Private Ryan"" isn't just a war film, and if you view it through that lens, the film loses much of it's impact, even with the brutality of Omaha Beach and the tank battle at the bridge. To be sure, the picture succeeds at capturing the intense horror of war, but it's power as a film goes deeper when it identifies with it's characters and examines their relationships with each other as soldiers and men. How do you find decency in the hell of warfare? One man at a time."
tt0103103,"I would usually be the last one to prefer an American remake to a French original. The remakes generally lose the quality that made them seem worthy of a remake in the first place.To me, one of the very few exceptions to this rule would be the case of La totale! and True Lies, with Arnold Schwarzenegger. If you have occasion to see this film, you will recognize nearly every scene. The remake added some scenes -- mostly spectacular ones -- and a much, much bigger budget. And a certain something else, a je ne sais quoi, a panache, a joie de vivre which the Gallic original is lacking. Surprising, but true. No lie."
tt0110912,I liked it! it was good becuase of the story i liked that. ( im just doing this so i can say ive left a movie review)
tt0120737,"At the end of this movie, it made me wonder what is the nature of drama and science fiction building for this movie or series.
Throughout this film - which was relatively long in length - he did not explain the importance of each individual and what dimensions would happen if we lost any of them, but he answered himself, is that if we lost any character if he affected us, some characters were interchangeable and without a dramatic build that made me not Sympathy for any character who died, what is the benefit of inserting characters and disposing of them without any dramatic construction that makes us sympathize with them? This is however, it took a long time for us to know the characters presented
As for building this world itself, it carries a lot of problems, such as how important is my knowledge of the number of rings that were made, or what is the importance of the people who carry them, the whole idea focused on one ring! Or what is the importance of those rings basically!
The film suffers from defects on the level of visual effects, and the solution was that they color the film with exaggerated colors in order to hide these defects.
On the level of events, and after reviewing it in my mind after finishing the film, I did not find anything that would serve the future development of events. The film was weak in exposing the dimensions of the world in which the story tells all that happened is to show the skills of characters in adventures that have no cause or meaning in three hours And half.
I did not like the way magic was cast and it was totally unattractive compared to other films like Harry Potter, and by the way Harry Potter was in the same year and it had much better visual effectsIn the end, I liked the original score and sounds and the cinematography, the movie gave us some wonderful staff"
tt0111161,"Decent entertainment, somewhat memorable. Why this is seen as such an incredible, sensational work of art is beyond me... I feel like this is one of the few crime-thriller-prison-action related films that met my expectations, as in, was A Good Film, but that alone doesn't make it a classic."
tt1375666,"Its all flash and little substance in Christopher Nolan's over long story of people able to go into the dreams of others.I'm not going to go into the plot, partly to play fair with those of you who haven't see the film, but Nolan has constructed a film so needlessly messy that its damn near impossible to summarize simply.Yes the visuals are spectacular, though most of them are obviously CGI creations. There are also fewer than you would think since the dream weavers of the story have to keep thing real in order to achieve their ends.For me the story isn't much of anything,certainly not enough to support a two and a half hour tale. The deepness of Nolan's ""philosophy"" is also over done, and ultimately meaningless since Nolan is on record as saying it's all been made up and exists purely to drive his plot.I like the story I just wish it didn't take so long to get where it was going.I also hate that Nolan changes the rules about half way in as a means of making things more exciting. Its not fair and I was so annoyed I walked out of the theater the first time I saw the film.Good not great, its worth a look see down the road."
tt0361748,"This was definitely one of the weakest films by Tarantino. And there was a simple reason why.He chose too serious and dramatic topic for his style. Yes, it fitted perfectly for Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs but to rape World War II in that way is a bit too much.First scene was very promising when the Nazi was explaining the French man why Nazi regime hates Jews. Secondly we were introduced to Inglorious Basterds. The group of brutal Jews killing Nazis. First I thought it was a fine idea but later it got pretty tiring.Then everything started to go downwards. Too long table scene showed the Jew girl Emanuelle who had escaped in the beginning from Nazis thinking about showing the great Nazi movie in her cinema. Afterwards another very long and weak table scene came by which ended with shooting.And then the finale where Emanuelle let her lover burn down the Nazis filled cinema including Adolf.Some big mistakes were that the table scenes and empty discussions were awful. They didn't lead nowhere. History rewriting in such a way wasn't believable as well. All great Nazis including Hitler were killed in a movie theater. And finally of course Tarantino's jokes which for me have been usually fine but put in such a plot wentjust too far.Still, if you can put it up you may enjoy this film. I wouldn't say it was a complete waste of time but Tarantino crossed the line from where it got controversial for even myself.More on the plus site there was some fine acting, some laughs and overall interesting point of view.So let's just say below average, don't expect it to be Pulp Fiction.. 4/10"
tt0120815,"Plenty of war drama and blockbuster action to start the movie, then a long boring few hours to end it. Very unrealistic overall. Hardly a great war movie. If we are to view the title of the movie as the plot of the movie, then we have been fooled greatly.If it is really saving Private Ryan, then why no scenes of Private Ryan until the movie is almost over? Well, if there had been, then they couldn't have played that little prank on the viewers of the first Private Ryan saved being the wrong one (Matt Damon).If you are going to watch this movie, have plenty of coffee, because after the first half you will fall asleep quick. This is just another stage for Tom Hanks, a mediocre actor that the studios keep trying to push down our throats (except for Forrest Gump, a role he was well equipped for). I give it 5 of 10 stars, because of a few good scenes."
tt0468569,"I noticed that a film I had not seen was riding high in the IMDb chart and being intrigued I bought my copy of The Dark Knight. I was fairly impressed with the special effects and the acting from the cast was good and it was clear that a certain amount of care, effort and attention had been put into the films production. Ultimately though I felt as if it was a case of a fairly good attempt but no cigar. The film could have been a classic but it simply isn't good enough. Personally I was glad I had watched it but will not be rushing to watch it again and its current position in the IMDb chart is way above where it should be. It is also clear that the film has numerous enthusiastic supporters and having watched the film I can see why. I think there are a lot of people out there who have got carried away with all the hype, marketing and advertising and also I think it may be a case of its cool to say how good it is and agree with the majority. Lets just see in say five years where this film figures in the various charts that are out there. This film is not bad but its not very good either. I am not in the slightest bit bothered about swimming against the tide where this film or any other film is concerned, if its not very good I will say so but what the hey as I have said before opinion is all and I would recommend that anybody watch it at least once."
tt0993846,"Basically, a waste of time and an insult to my intelligence. One star for being in color, a second star for all the great looking girls, okay a third star for Leonardo, but offset this by a negative star for glamorizing drug addition and irresponsible wealth (yes it did!). I expect a movie to either entertain me or emotionally move me. This did neither. I know the drug usage and corruption for the sake of money was meant to be revolting, but instead it came across as being painted as desirable. Sorry to see such talent wasted on this. I'm guessing the book/script must have had more appeal than actually seeing this as a film."
tt7286456,The plot could've been a little more defined BUT Joaquin is phenomenal. Flawlessly done. He deserves every award possible for his performance.
tt0102926,"I'll never forget my first viewing of this movie at the theater and will always look back fondly on it for one reason: helping me quit smoking cigarettes.I read the book first, was fascinated by it, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.Although entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch, especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer, ""Buffalo Bill."" ""Bill"" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent ""Clarice Starling"" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as ""Jack Crawford."" A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts ""Clarice,"" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.""Silence Of The Lambs"" has turned into a modern-day ""classic."" If by some odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark, difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off other things."
tt0133093,"Vastly overrated. Overly complex, much of which is just for the writer/directors to show how clever they are. Clever this is not, more like pretentious. Add to this the fact that it stars Keanu Reeves, surely one of the worst dramatic actors of all time."
tt0848228,"The ""Avengers"" was an action packed movie from start to finish. It was fun and entertaining to watch. To be honest, I didn't know the background of each of the superheroes, because I rarely get a chance to sit down and watch an entire movie. But, the plot was kept pretty simple. So, it was pretty easy to follow (even for someone like me).I thought that this movie was absolutely hilarious! There was a steady amount of humor throughout the entire movie that just keeps you rolling and makes it just about impossible not to laugh. The scene where the Hulk grabbed a hold of Loki and was pounding him into the floor mid sentence was just the hilarious. I was rolling out of my seat. The Iron Man really had quite a few good lines too that gave the movie just enough seasoning to entice you.In my opinion though, I thought this movie was just OK. I felt like there were too many scenes that were impossible and not clearly laid out, and it dragged down the movie's quality. For example, when Captain America was waiting on Iron Man to queue him to pull the lever when they were fixing the engine, an enemy came and started shooting at him continually. Captain America had no protection or safe haven for quite some time, but he still was never injured. Or another example was at the end when Iron Man fell from the sky after taking the atom bomb up into space. To be honest, I thought it was absolutely ridiculous that he walked away from that unharmed. I guess I'm too realistic for fairy tales.There were some parts that I couldn't understand either. Such as, how things ended up with Loki's brother. It seemed to me at first, that he was not on the superheroes side, and then, he ended up being a good guy? And also while in the plane after Loki was captured, he said he's worried about what will happen after his brother shows up, and then later he turns completely cocky and is not intimidated by his brother at all. Maybe it's just me, but I thought because of these things, this movie's quality wasn't that great. So in my opinion, this movie was pretty predictable and lacked any kind of twists in it. It was a typical good versus evil movie, and I've seen lots of them."
tt0111161,"!!Spoilers to this movie, as well as to Sixth Sense and Citizen Kane just for spite!!Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that oozes with ""give me an Oscar pleeeeeease"" all over it. You know the type  - like ""Dances with Wolves."" Oversentimental and overlong. It's surprising that this movie has such a high imdb ranking considering it's such a very black and white (prisoners=good, prison-keepers=evil) movie rehashing what's been hashed and hashed many times.The story concerns an apparently-wrongly-convicted banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is sentenced to life at Shawshank Prison in that creepiest of states, Maine, for murdering his wife and her lover. His main 'friend' at Shawshank is wily old-time-prisoner named Red (Morgan Freeman). Nobody can deny that Morgan Freeman is one of the greatest actors ever, and I'm not going to. Tim Robbins also gives a performance that one wouldn't guess he had in him by watching, say, ""Nothing to Lose"" (which nevertheless is a better movie). And the supporting cast is all excellent in roles that are incredibly one-dimensional. Okay, that's it for the good. Here comes the bad, and the ugly.Early on in the film, Red, who doubles as the narrator, tells us that although he'd like to tell us Andy wasn't gang-raped by some of the fellow inmates (the only bad inmates in there, by the way, and then they get sent away, so that leaves only good ones) but he can't, cause ""that'd be a fairytale.  And there are no fairytales here at Shawshank."" How wrong he is! The whole movie is a fairytale (albeit without any of the excitement and fast-pace of one).We get characters who are so completely good as to be Saints for our two main prisoners (and most of the other ones) and the Prison guards and warden who all seem to be variations on the evil stepmother from Cinderella and the evil stepmother from Snow White (heck, they're so evil, their intramural baseball team's name is the Marauders. Gee, I wonder if you people get the hidden message?).The story itself is about two-and-a-half hours of sadism (very slow-paced sadism, mind you), an hour of philosophical jabbering that, frankly, is far inferior to a philosophy class at the college if you're into that sort of thing (Hope is Good? Oh my God! What a revelation! Tell me more! Honestly, I've heard songs which have more depth than this movie!) And half an hour of the ending.It's hard to talk about the faults of the movie without giving away the ending, because, the ending itself is one of the main ones. All good movies have an ending that makes you think (or at least are somewhat open to interpretation, and/or sequels). But not this one. Although I counted at least five or six points where the movie could have ended with leaving some room for thought, it follows through to the bitter predictable end. It's as if it's saying ""you know what, you viewers are all idiots, we better not let you think about anything at all."" Even if that was true, it's quite insulting.  What's more is the ending is incredibly predictable. How could it not be, if it's told to you in the title of the movie? I mean, imagine if the Sixth Sense was called ""The Dead Psychologist"" or Citizen Kane was called ""The Sled"" (sorry, imdb censorship guys, I know this makes your job harder, but I just can't think of a way to explain it otherwise).And I haven't even mentioned the worst part. This movie is incredibly long and boring. It's not a movie that is ""slow"" or ""moves at its own pace"" - those are alright by me. No, this movie, something is always happening, but not a single thing of interest. And like that for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration. But still.Another thing is this movie's already-mentioned assumed self-importance. It's irritating at the least. It's a long, boring, unoriginal version of what Cinderella would be if somebody traded in all the women characters for swearing, rape and police brutality. I mean, frankly, Charles Perrot beat you to it by four centuries, that's close to an all time record for unoriginality!"
tt0372784,"Director Christopher Nolan pulls out all the stops as he embarks on solidifying Batman lore with his retelling of how one Bruce Wayne became the capped crusader Batman. Nolan dazzles in many scenes and is always rock solid, never resorting to cheap humor or unnecessary special effects. This Batman is a dark tale that explains why Batman is the person he is, why he became the person he was to be, and what lies ahead. Christian Bales does a credible job in the lead. He is surrounded by first-rate performers lending their experience and acting savvy: Michael Caine as Alfred(very, very good), Morgan Freeman as Luscious(very, very good), Gary Oldman as policeman Gordon(very good) and villains Liam Neeson(very good), the ever impressive Tom Wilkinson(excellent), and Cillian Murphy(very good). Rutger Hauer is also along as is Katie Holmes(big deal huh?) I really enjoyed this film and was impressed with its cohesiveness and strong script. The script, the direction, the acting, the sets, and the special effects all blend together and make a fine film and probably the definitive Batman film to date. I know many people will compare this to the two Burton films - both good films in their own way. But this Batman is not that Batman. There are no one-liners here and there mixed in with an occasional over-blown scene. This film is a very serious take on a very serious man that has devoted his life to stopping crime in Gotham."
tt0109830,"Over the years I had often heard how great the movie ' Forrest Gump' really is or was and it's one of the best movies ever made. My mum on the other hand thought it was boring. Over the years I kept switching back and forth as to whether or not I really wanted to watch this movie because it didnt look appealing or something I'd be interested in other than iconic pop culture line of ' Life's like a box of chocolates"" thingWell I finally decided to watch this movie. How bad or good could it be, right? Well sad to say I didnt like this movie at all, it was boring and dragged on for too long throughout the story. I get what ' Forrest Gump' is trying to tell - appreciate the little things in life, what really means most to you and being the best that you can be even when life slaps you in the face. I get itIm just not a fan of it and that's ok. A movie can have great meaningful lessons and themes to take a way especially if it really touched you but eh if the story is such a drag and so boring, then my interest or the movie's likeability is completely out the windowThe character of ' Forrest Gump' is ok. He's wholesome, humble, simple minded, kind and not smart but means well. But eh didnt think he was all that interesting of a character. I dont know, this movie and the character itself didnt click well with me. If I had to say one good thing is the relationship between Forrest and Jenny, they both clearly loved each other but due to the traumas Jenny suffered as a child she felt unworthy and kept running away until finally overcoming her demons and accepting Forrest's love. The different paths they choose before that with Forrest somehow doing well and Jenny not so much was interestingBut overall this is not a movie I think I would want to watch again at all. Not a fan."
tt0167261,"I went to this movie with an open mind, expecting to see something great, yet throughout the whole movie I was bored and uninterested. I've read Tolkien's books two times and greatly love them, but ""The Two Towers"" does not capture the beauty and sadness that is within the books. One does not want to leave the world of Middle Earth when reading the books yet I greatly appreciated seeing the ending of the movie.Peter Jackson's directing was very annoying and redundant. He sets up his 180's with no sense of space, at times completely breaking the over the shoulder shots between two characters causing the breakup in the space to occur when it should not. There were too many close-ups when there should have been medium shots and too many extreme long shots when there should have been only long shots. Landscape scenes were often framed with no characters or tiny specks of characters, it should have been filmed as many of the classic westerns were filmed, capturing landscape and characters within the same frame where we could at least feel as if we're there with them and a part of their adventure.Jackson does not create feeling through images in ""The Two Towers,"" he relies more on dialogue to tell the audience what is happening. The scenes with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum I would have enjoyed better had they been shown with more images and facial expressions from the actors. You can't rely on words to describe the terrible power of the ring, it has to be displayed with images. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" comes close to doing this.The screenplay should have had a major rewrite staying truer to the book with more natural dialogue. Many of the lines would be spoken and fall flat. There was no projection or passion in the lines, they were too stilted. Joking in the middle of a battle should have been crossed out by the director, and the entire love story should have been deleted. Doing this would have left room for the many scenes that were left out from the book. The ending of this movie lacks in drama and suspense, I deeply wanted to feel drawn into it and expect the next and last adventure, but the only thing I wanted was to get out of the room.What I greatly saw spelled over the entire movie was ""TIRED."" The actors were tired and the director was tired, and this was just another movie to crank out. With every scene saying ""OK, that's done. Let's move on,"" with no care or artistic appreciation of the true art of filmmaking. I don't expect much from ""The Return of the King"" next year and I don't expect much from Peter Jackson as he's too soft of a director to show the true grittiness of Middle Earth. He is targetting this movie more towards females and those who haven't read the books and not true Tolkien fans like myself.Overall it was a decent action film, with your typical fight choreography, one liners, Legolas and his unlimited arrows, and the good guys always coming out unscathed. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was excellent and this movie should have stayed more along the lines of that, with some improvements. On a scale of one to ten I give it a seven, because it wasn't all that bad and it wasn't all that good and at least they tried.7/10"
tt0137523,"Sorry, gang;  I'm giving this a thumbs down.  This pic has great cinamatography and art direction but that only makes it a video, not a movie.The director and writer had a few ideas for half a movie but couldn't think of anything else while the bills piled up.  The first act was good enough but would have been better if it had made up it's mind where it was going. Too many scenes which promised something proved to be red herrings while others just plain dragged.  The last act summed up nothing which went on before;  it also introduced character relationships and elements which hadn't been seen earlier. Thus the story arc was a complete wreck.  On top of all that, the whole movie runs some 30 to 40 minutes too long.  All of which are the classic signs of poor direction and writing.  It brings to mind the fiasco that was Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991).It started out as an off-beat buddy movie and ended as cheesy, pyschodramatic wish-fulfillment shlock on a par with The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) except with a bigger budget and no catchy songs.  It calls out, `look at me!' but then says nothing else, hoping a fashionably alienated, post-ironic attitude will make up the difference.  It never did and never will."
tt0167261,"My least favorite Christmas treat for my family was the film Lord of the Rings-Two Towers, which I found excruciatingly too long...the fanny factor kicked in after the first two hours and except for the scenery and special effects, I found this just plain boring - the one with the most charisma in the film was that talking tree!"
tt0848228,"I have to say, I'm obsessed with superhero movies! I love most of them so I was one of the most excited people to see it.I think it was alright. Not more or less. It seemed to me as if all the Avengers were redundant except for Iron Man because every time they fought, he came and made it right. I also didn't like most of the acting & Scarlett Johansson was more than a waste for the story. She just had no meaning and her character wasn't necessary in any way. I also don't understand why everyone liked Hulk so much. I think Mark Ruffalo did a great job with playing the angry professor but as Hulk? Just no.. he couldn't get a single giggle out of me. The only one that really impressed me was Loki & I loved him already after the first minutes of ""Thor"".I admit I'm not a professional review writer, in fact it's my first one so it may be really bad but I had to say that I just didn't like it. I was expecting so much, maybe that was my fault. I will watch the movie again, maybe it's one of these movies which only make an impression after the first 3 views."
tt7286456,"This is a rather dark and sick movie that I would not recommend to anyone. However, you may want to watch it just to see how irrelevant the Academe Awards have become. Joaquin Phoenix has real life mental disturbance issues and he is certainly type cast well in this movie. I guess he got the Oscar for actually being crazy, but I don't think most people would really care to watch this mess."
tt0102926,Pretty good. great performance by anthony hopkins. lots of really dark and frightening scenes. (1 viewing)
tt7286456,"The movie is very well made in almost every way. It details how the joker becomes - the joker. It makes sense that the journey is not a particularly pleasant experience and I guess lots of people can appreciate it. But I did not enjoy watching this movie very much. It was simply too depressing for my taste. And the joker too miserable.I left the cinema with a feeling that I would have been better off not watching it.But hey, that was just my experience."
tt0139414,"(Some Spoilers) It's when a skin diver was found floating to the surface of Lake Placid, or Black Lake as it's now called, bitten in half that alarm bells started ringing from the State of Maine to New York's Natural History Museum in that something strange was happening in the waters out there.With a very reluctant head of the Paleontology Department at the museum young Kelly Wells,Bridget Fonda,dispatched to far off Maine to determine what's the cause of this horror she's confronted by local Fish & Game Warden Jack Wells,Bill Pullman, and local sheriff Hank Keough,Brendan Gleeson. The two right away don't see eye to eye with Kelly in what's going on or in the lake. Kelly feels that both Wells & Keoguh are a big turned off in Kelly, a big city girl with a collage PHD, in her hampering their instigation. It's both Wells & Keough feel that she doesn't know squat, by never going outside of New York City limits, about the great outdoors despite her being an expert on wildlife in and out of the water.It soon becomes apparent that there's something very dangerous lurking in the lake after a second attack happened where a deputy sheriff ended up getting decapitated when boat that Wells Kelly and Sheriff Keough was riding on looking for whatever was committing these atrocities was almost capsize. It's that's the nutty Mythology Professor Hector Cyr, Oliver Platt, was called in to help in the investigation. It soon becomes evident,after an attacking grizzly bear was attacked and dragged into the lake, what what's killing off the people and wildlife in the area is: A monster size over 30 foot long and up to four ton Asiatic salt water crocodile! The crocodile somehow swam thousands of miles and ended up in the re-named Lake Black,formerly Lake Placid, through underwater channels connecting the lake to the Atlantic Ocean! It also becomes very apparent that professor Cry a crocodile lover who feels that crocodiles are the highest and most noble form of life on earth is going to do everything in his power, even risk his as well as anyone else's lives,to save the monster crocodile from extinction!***SPOILERS*** As we soon learn it's old lady Delores Bickerman,Betty White, who's really behind all this carnage in and around the lake. Mrs Brickerman has for some seven years been feeding the monster crocodile the livestock on her farm as well as keeping from the police the truth of the disappearance of her husband Berney who in fact was one of her favorite pet's-the crocodile-first meals or victims! With the truth about the monster crocodile now out in the open it's decided to kill the thing by sending in the entire state Fish & Game Department and well as all the law enforcement personnel within 50 miles of the lake where the beast resides. But as expected it's the nutty Professor Hector Cyr who's love for the monster crocodile exceeds his own as well as anyone on else lives does everything his his power to keep that from happening.Exciting final with the big showdown between man and beast at Black Lake with very unexpected and at the same time, for Hector Cyr, satisfying results. It's then that we in the audience as well as both Sheriff Keough and Fish & Game Warden and Forest Ranger Wells see just how right Hector was in keeping the killer crocodile alive! Not for just farther scientific studies but, with the film ""Lake Placid"" grossing almost 60 million dollars worldwide, for up until now two and even a third future sequel!"

To release the picture they change the original name to Cuba Libre. The director's cut was 3 and a half hours long. It was released on the festival of Bangkok in Thailand. It was the second film of Gael Garc√≠a Bernal (the first was Amores Perros)and the first of Juan Gerard as a Director. In the poster the names of Diana Bracho and Cecilia Suares does not appear.

tt0372784,"While I enjoy Tim Burton ""Batman"" immensely, I cannot stand this one. What are the problems with ""Batman Begins""? Well, I can name at least three ones. But what three!Reality. How come they put Gotham City into the real world together with Rome and other true-to-life cities? It is simply laughable. In the Burton movie Gotham is such an amazing ethereal place that it just frees your mind. And here we have a dirty town next to New York or whatever.Background. In certain amounts the background is great. But when everything gets explained, stretched out, chewed and re-chewed with a detailed psychological analysis of the characters... it gets boring and nauseating. In ""Batman"" (1989) we had two psychos. They just clashed and the whole Gotham was a battlefield for the two maniacs who did not have to back themselves up with the loads of facts from their lives - they were too stylish for that paraphernalia and too insane. And what do we have here? Numerous flashbacks which are annoying. The main character's idiotic samurai-like training as if he were going to become a Jedi knight from ""Star Wars"" trilogy (and there is also that actor who performed in ""Star Wars: Episode 1""). Scrutinized explanation of the technology performed by Mr Morgan Freeman and of the way it can be purchased. Deep speeches delivered by the evil and good guys that resemble the notorious rubbish talks from ""Matrix: Reloaded"".Actors with profound performance. What the hell is wrong with the performance? It's too self-imposing. I feel as if these actors are going to burst from inside ¬ñ their self-importance is simply overwhelming. I feel the need to shout at the TV-set: ""Come on guys! It's ""Batman"", not ""Born on the Forth of July""!"" Those serious talks and big serious faces resemble scenes from ""Godfather"". Fine, they are making a deep criminal saga out of a comics booklet. Just brilliant.That's enough to lower the mark to a 3-out-of-10 level. The conception has been ruined. It's no match for the ""Batman"" from the 1989. By the way, I tried to watch this movie twice. For me to watch it from top to toe was unbearable.My verdict: unwatchable for the most part of its running time, but at least not completely tasteless and repellent (its major achievement). 3 out of 10. I would never bother commenting this one but it's on the top list while ""Batman"" (1989) is not. I cannot take this for granted. Thanks for attention."
tt0468569,"I sat down with this movie after knowing that most people loved and seemed to venerate it. But I have a lot of perspective. I was reading Batman comics back in 1957, and I have seen all of the greatest movies ever made. This just isn't one of them. I did not care about anyone. The action was remorseless and unnecessary, one could even say gratuitous. I even turned it off by the 2-hour mark because it got so maudlin and disjointed. I did read something about people voting this into fifth position of the greatest 250 movies ever made, and clearly this shows the weight of current voters who have little experience with good movies. Why, they should be asked, does Citizen Kane, a 1941 movie always rank as the best movie ever? Because it had story, wonderful acting, human nature, and on and on, all things missing from Dark Knight.Movies today are thrown together with lots of action, preposterous stories, and computer effects. Characters survive falls and bangs that would put anyone, including a linebacker for the NFL, in hospital for a week or more. As with another reviewer, I am now finding it hard to remember to much about this movie, but I can remember every scene in a great movie, like The Maltese Falcon, etc."
tt0361748,"I take exception to the comment that one reviewer made saying that a film like Inglourious Basterds had not been made before. Not only was one made, but it was made during World War II. When Hitler, Dead Or Alive was shown I'm sure the same rousing cheers went up from the audience who really wanted World War II to end that way.Quentin Tarantino must have seen Hitler, Dead Or Alive and decided to do a big budget version of that B film propaganda flick from the Forties. In that one Ward Bond, Paul Fix,and Warren Hymer play three German speaking gangsters who take a contract out on Adolph Hitler from some public spirited citizen. They enlist in the army, but as soon as they can they desert grab a plane with a pilot and land in Germany and set about to perform their task.What Tarantino has given us is Hitler, Dead Or Alive with official sanction. Brad Pitt heads a group of GIs, the rest of them are Jewish so they'll have proper motivation for this job, Pitt's a good old boy from Tennessee. The purpose of their mission is to just kill Nazis, the higher up, the better. And they soon get a reputation that's come to the attention of the Fuehrer himself.This film is a throwback to those propaganda films that came out as morale boosters during World War II. Pitt and the rest of the cast look like they're having a great old time with this. Best performance is Christoph Waltz who plays an SS colonel who specialized in tracking down Jews who've escaped Hitler's final solution. He might just get an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.As for the end, just relax and imagine this is World War II in an alternate Universe."
tt0480025,"Not a patch on Ken Loach, those small actors used by those directors could act. Apart from three performers Combo, the d√©butant playing Shaun and the girl playing Smell I found the acting and there directed improvisation cringe worthy. I also thought a couple of actors were acting out of there class. Straight out of a middle class stage school.There was to much use of cheap shots of housing estate as filler with music played over the top which had no relevance to the period.I'm a great fan of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach but this film didn't come close to capturing the time and social pressures in the 70's and 80's in Northern England.I always knew the performers were acting unfortunately, sometimes badly which I don't feel in Loach's films, notably Kes."
tt0108052,"Only Stephen Spielberg could make a film about the holocaust where the point is that none of the major characters do NOT die.  To me the message is lost because of this and the film becomes a glorification of one man surrounded by the deaths of millions.  Oscar Schindler was a Nazi embroiled in the holocaust and the second world war.  He managed to save his friends, yet profited from concentration camps.  Ok, so he wasn't an anti-semite bent on destruction, but he only saved people he was connected to, and their families.And the evil Nazis in this film are all slightly comical.  Where is the evil?  Where is the horror?  Where is all the death and torture and misery.Scrape the surface of this film and you find a gratuitous ""entertainment"" movie.  If you want to know about the holocaust watch Shoah."
tt0068646,"I continually fail to understand why The Godfather is hailed as ""The Greatest Movie of All Time"".  I've seen it twice--a second time just to make sure--and I have to tell you that I sat there in a stupor, bored out of my mind.  And I'm not a teenager raised on MTV; I'm in my 30s and am absolutely devoted to movies--I've seen as many classics (American & foreign) that I can get my hands on.  But, for me, The Godfather ranks alongside Singin' in the Rain as the most overrated films of all time.Singin' in the Rain, at least, I get (it's just my intense dislike for Donald O'Connor that makes me dislike this film).  But The Godfather?   It's just a bland epic about a bunch of moronic gangsters, with Marlon Brando giving a campy performance, and riddled with repulsive violence.  Give me a break.  The fact that this movie is so ""beloved"" has had the direct result that nowadays we got absurdly worse and worse films every year, created by clueless filmmakers."
tt0114369,"The movie did not have any depth or meaning. No character growth no moral and the end... Oh, I don't want to say anything just disappointing. But the overall movie was thrilling and exciting to watch if you are into that I guess..."
tt1375666,"Famous for a script that was so complicated even the actors themselves didn't understand what was going on, Inception is one of Christopher Nolan's most famous films, which, given his string of popular movies, is saying something. It's a science fiction film that takes dream analysis to several new levels. In the film, it's Leonardo DiCaprio's job to put his clients to sleep, then enter their dream subconscious and find out information they need. It gets much more complicated, but for the sake of saving your brain, that's the plot in a nutshell.Nolan recruited an all-star supporting cast, including Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Tom Berenger, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, in one of his first dramatic roles. While everyone tries very hard to give serious, dramatic performances to thrill and move the audience, it doesn't always come across that way. Marion seems like she's trying to remember how to speak English, Joe seems like he's desperately trying to get the audience to forget he was ever in 3rd Rock from the Sun, and Leo looks like he's out of tears and thinks a wrinkled face will be just as convincing.The special effects of the film absolutely deserved the hype and the Academy Award, as scenes literally bend and crumble into one another as the different dream sequences blend. If you love movies with incredible special effects, this is a must-see.If you even mention the title to anyone who's seen it, it'll no doubt spark an hour long discussion about what the story and ending meant. I watched the film, and with the exception of a couple of little details during the dream-within-a-dream sequences, I understood it perfectly. To me, the ending was not one that needed discussion, so I don't quite understand the reason behind everyone's endless debates. However, if that type of story intrigues you, you might want to watch this one with your friends so you can stay up late afterwards and talk about what you think it meant."
tt0111161,"There are some things in this life we will never understand... How did the universe begin? What happens to our souls when we die? How did a movie as bland as The Shawshank Redemption become so overrated?In the case of certain other movies, I can at least understand the reasons why they're overrated. But The Shawshank Redemption is so... average. And clich√©-ridden. The film's moral is basically that hope is important, and there's nothing wrong with that in itself. Heck - I have no problem with simplicity. The problem is when you move past the simple and into the land of the simplistic. The movie treats its borrowed plot parts (Count of Monte Cristo, anyone?) and banal themes as though they were freshly minted nuggets of wisdom. (I wouldn't be complaining if it didn't pretend to be anything more than a pleasant diversion.) However, it is with its very last shot that the movie reveals its true condescending colours. If it had ended moments earlier instead, with that poetic shot of the sea, I would have had some respect for it (that's where the superior original story ends). But no, the director had to spell things out for his audience. Frank Darabont knows how to tell a story. He just doesn't know how to tell one with any originality or depth.The movie is partially redeemed by three things. The majestic cinematography, the powerful score, and most of all, Morgan Freeman, one of the very best actors working today.As for my rating, yes I'm one of those jerks who gives a movie a 1 just to lower it on the top 250. I think it's outrageous how highly it's ranked here. Even the folks who made it would think it's ridiculous to consider it one of the greatest films ever made."
tt0361748,"I admire Quentin Tarantino for his creative mind but find most of the movies to be a tribute to murder and violence. Putting the gore aside you'd be compelled to say ""it was a good movie"". I enjoyed the drama in the bar when the inglorious bastards met the German actress (the informer), and everything went wrong. I enjoyed the drama around the theater and that the Germany's best Marksman fell in low with the Jewish girl boasting about his many kills (without consideration to whether her relatives or friends would be among the victims) and how the circle is closed at the end.But after seeing the mass murder scene in the theater I cannot help to be disgusted by the glorification of hatred, murder and revenge. The basic ingredients of anything marked Quentin Tarantino."
tt0816692,"The plot is pretty standard, nothing new at all if you've read enough SF classics. The male cast is good, the adult female cast is awful, a small number of scenes are impressive, the so-called music reminisces of chalk on a blackboard, but all that doesn't matter because...YOU CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING WHEN PEOPLE TALK. Hum, sorry, I was saying that the sound department was run by either a deaf or retarded person. And so is Mr Nolan, who possibly didn't bother checking his final product. The thing that passes for music is that loud. Reading lips sometimes help, but half the talking is through radio anyway, so good luck with that.That's when I realise that Nolan can't actually tell a story through pictures. In many scenes, what is shown is severely shifted from what should be seen, and I would really need the dialogue to explain what is happening, but I can't decipher it because, you know, idiots at the helm. In the same vein, there are quite a lot of inconsistencies and silly concepts. And maybe the writer did come up with acceptable vocal explanations, but I'll never know, because a monkey spilled the background soundtrack all over the track I wanted to hear, and nobody cleaned it up.During the projection, I was seriously and increasingly getting angry at the technical lousiness. That's a first. Hollowood has reached new levels of incompetence.Save your time and money for something made by caring professionals."
tt0429078,"Admittedly, Seven Swords explodes onto the screen in fine form. The action is brutal, in your face and surprisingly violent. The story is simple, but fast paced. The characters are believable. The fight choreography dazzles. The cinematography and art direction are captivating. Indeed, I found myself wondering exactly what it was that made the critics moan so furiously.Then it hit me. As the movie progress, its steamer whistles thin, coughing occasional death rattles as the plot drags itself up an arduous, bouldered mountain slope. For a period of what feels like forty minutes, virtually nothing happens, that is to say, nothing of particular interest or necessity to the story.Characters that you might have liked at the start of the movie become irritating, their behavior confusing, and choppy, fitful editing does not help to make anything much clearer. You will quickly begin to notice how the majority of the female leads, in particular Green Pearl, rely on panting and gasping like they're giving birth in order to convey almost all their emotions. As I sat, drenched by the tumultuous waves of dialog, I found myself being invaded by that empty feeling I get when I repeat a word a hundred times over until it loses all meaning.Unless you are endowed with the almighty patience of Buddha, you will find yourself silently screaming for the film to MOVE!!!And it does, eventually, career downwards at breakneck speed into a flaming, physics-defying finale in which all seven Masters get to send up sparks. Trouble is, most people will have gone home before the fireworks."
tt0361424,"This is an excellent PC game. It's one of my favorites that I have. The designs and voices are excellent. It really is just like the show.In the first case, ""Inn and Out"", a girl named Kylie is murdered in a hotel room. Even though they arrest a man at first in the end they get the real person. Case two, ""Light My Fire"", is about a man who sets fire to his own home. Case three, ""Garvey's Beat"" is about a cop killed in the line of duty. Case four, ""More Fun Than A Barrel of Corpses"", is about a woman who is killed by another. Case five, ""Leda's Swan Song"", Grisson gets abducted, but thank god is saved.Excellent Game."
tt0344727,"OK, so I set your expectations too high and you won't agree with me. But I came in to this episode with no expectations at all and this was just brilliant. The basis of 'Sykes and a Bus' is that Eric is the driver and Hattie (his sister, of course) is the 'clippie' on a pre-Routemaster London Bus (the #136, as it happens). They aren't very good at it, and of course their unconventionality makes them a tremendous success and gets up the nose of... well the plots are all pretty much the all the same aren't they. It's the way the writers (Spike Milligan amongst others) set up the jokes and keep you guessing and smiling that is just art at work, a pure pleasure to watch. Hattie looks so young here (Hmm, Eric doesn't, but he must have been 40 I suppose, geez he's still in films at 80 though), and they both act so naturally in their parts, totally relaxed. Anyway - brilliant. Thanks BBC 4 for rolling out your archive!"
tt0284964,"Lost Souls sees director T.F. Mou treating the subject of illegal immigration from China to Hong Kong with the same level of tact and sensitivity that he gave the prisoners of Japanese experiment camp Unit 731 in his notorious shocker Man Behind the Sun (1988). In other words, virtually none - any pretense of social commentary is quickly abandoned in favour of pure sensationalism.The film opens as three illegal immigrants arrive in Hong Kong, having swum from mainland China, with the hope of making it to Diamond Hill, a place of unimaginable prosperity. Unfortunately, the trio are quickly captured by criminals, who make money by holding people for ransom, or by selling women to brothels. What follows is a catalogue of degradation, humiliation, physical and sexual abuse, and death, the three new arrivals thrown into a barn with other unfortunates, stripped naked and beaten until they give up their relative's telephone numbers, which the villains need to extract ransom money.Virtually plotless for most of its running time, the film careens from one act of brutality to another, with an excess of full frontal nudity from both sexes in the process. There's a gang rape scene that culminates in the victim being swung wildly around the barn, still attached to her attacker at the groin, before being thrown across the barn like a rag doll; a woman is covered in petrol and burnt alive; and in the film's most eye-watering scene, the gang's chief gets the vaseline out to sodomise one of the young men (who is bound to a chair, ass up).To be honest, the lack of storyline and continuous deviancy eventually results in tedium, and a much needed change of pace is more than welcome when the prisoners finally revolt (not that they weren't already revolting, having smeared themselves in cow dung to try and avoid being raped!): the poor guy who was buggered gets revenge, killing his attacker by biting him on the neck (but is beaten to death thereafter by the boss's henchmen), and it's not long before the rest of the prisoners decide enough is enough. Turning the tables on their tormenters, the immigrants clothe themselves and head for the city in a mini-van, but, in a scene reminiscent of The Great Escape, are rumbled by police at a road-block when one of them makes a faux pas (by saying ""Thank you, comrade"").The fittingly downbeat ending sees the only immigrant that evaded capture finally making it to Diamond Hill, only to discover that it is a slum. Bummer!6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb."
tt0111161,"This suspense filled, dramatic movie rides high on the plain of self discovery, self worth and self preservation; if an innocent man is locked up for two decades with criminals, nothing else will he learn than to be a criminal himself. There is no better movie that I can recommend you to see than this classic Jail Break that stared one of the best supporting actors you will love to have on your side if you are in the lead role of a movie, Morgan Freeman.Shawshank Redemption was adapted from a Stephen King novella named Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Frank Darabont secured the right to make the film from King in 1987, and he worked intensively on the screenplay for a proper adaptation of the movie, Darabont's screenplay writing earned him an Academy Award nomination, in fact the movie had seven Academy Award nominations and won none.The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is a banker who got convicted for murdering his wife and her lover; he got two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. At Shawshank Andy befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) Red was a contraband smuggler.Andy also developed a nice rapport with the warden and the other guards helping them with their taxes and also helping the warden in his money laundering operation.The movie boast of amazing scenery not to add an impressive cinematography, the movie growth and inclusion and exit of characters will make you feel like you are reading a book, the movie has numerous cast, and it is broken into segments each introducing new casts and each building a parallel wall that guides us to the climatic end.It didn't do well in the box office at all barely making back its production cost, but due to critic's high rating and Academy Award nomination, Golden Globe award nomination and other notable nominations, the movie did well in rental and DVD sales, it is shown regularly on Cable TV, and it has a high following.Frank Darabont who is the director and screenplay writer also made more of King's books; He directed the 1999 Tom Hanks movie The Green Mile which was a box office success compared to this. The Green Mile is another of King's books that is about a prison, and Darabont also directed the 2007 movie The Mist which is also based on a Stephen King book.Here is a DVD every home should have.www.lagsreviews.com"
tt1345836,"'The Dark Knight Rises' isn't Epic. But its impressive nonetheless. Christopher Nolan delivers a film worth watching, however, he doesn't quiet top himself in here. Its an entertainer!'The Dark Knight Rises' Synopsis: Eight years on, a new terrorist leader, Bane, overwhelms Gotham's finest, and the Dark Knight resurfaces to protect a city that has branded him an enemy.'The Dark Knight Rises' is overtly long & dragging. Christopher Nolan & Jonathan Nolan's Screenplay is excellent in parts, but at times, it comes across as dragging & long. For example, the bad-guy, Bane, played by Tom Hardy, why does he hate Gotham so much & why he's being so god-damn heartless. There is proper reason, yet he's creating a chaos. Another flaw, lies in its running time. 168 minutes seems a bit too stretched. Christopher Nolan's Direction is extremely competent. Cinematography is grand. Editing & Art Design, are spectacular. Action-Sequences are huge.Performance-Wise: Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman, shines. The Oscar-Winning Actor is so believable & natural in his part. Tom Hardy as Bane, is a big letdown. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, is quite good. Michael Caine as Alfred, is given the backseat, while Gary Oldman as James Gordon & New-Entry Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake, are terrific. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate, has a delicious role. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, is dignified.On the whole, 'The Dark Knight Rises' is an impressive superhero flick, but it isn't half as good as its predecessor 'The Dark Knight'."
tt1130884,"I was set to see this new psychologically thriller, a Martin Scorcese movie and straight into the top 250 in the IMDb list. One question I want to ask is how did this happen?? It was a clever plot line with great potential but I was sat in the cinema waiting for the big thrill. Not once was I sat on the edge of my seat. I scare very easily, I almost contemplated not going because I thought it was going to be so scary. So I went expecting what had been conveyed as a psychologically thriller, yet I was not thrilled at all. Even when you are expecting a cheap scare there was none. Even when you were sat there waiting for a big twist or a scream from the audience or a big thrill from this so called brilliant movie, I was not once scared, not once thrilled and not once satisfied. It could easily have ended half an hour before it did and honestly I wish it had. A complete disappointment and I hugely urge you not to pay money to see this movie, it is not worth it and definitely do not go if you think it is going to be a good movie, if you go, go expecting it to be bad so that you might actually enjoy it."
tt0137523,"This might be the stoopidest movie ever made. The story is ridiculous, the twist beyond retarded.Spoiler ALERTOooh Brad Pitt IS Ed Norton. Is this supposed to be deep?Given what passes as intellectualism and political discourse in this country, it is no wonder that this film is heralded as a masterpiece. I give major props to Fincher for imbuing this piece of idiocy with great style. The lighting and clothes are top -notch. But that does not make for a good movie. I'm sure to teenage bozos, this is about something. To anyone with a brain it is pure dreck.Is that supposed to be funny? Is it supposed to be insightful? What it leaves one with, is a feeling that Brad Pitt sure wishes he was cooler than he is."

I definitely don't think it's bad maybe it's just not my cup of tea. I walked away and took away a whole lot of nothing I'm sitting here trying to think of maybe what was the big thing that I'm supposed to leave the movie with like the message or even just what it wanted to say and to be honest idk it was just a lot of stuff. A lot cool stuff and stuff I enjoyed watching. I just don't get it. Maybe I'm supposed to rewatch it and I'll get it then but that in it of it self takes away some points for me cause I should at least have something the first time around something more to motivate me to watch it again then just confusion cause tbh as I said I just don't get it.Now I just read some stuff explaining what the movie was trying to do more. Tbh I think it's cool and all what it's trying to do sure but it's just so confusing and sure movies that make you think are cool but at least for me it's trying to make you think too much. Like I think it's cool and all but when I'm going to watch a movie I don't wanna have to leave needing to read some explainer articles like i don't wanna have to be a massive film buff to enjoy a movie I should be able to enjoy it whether I know a lot about movies or not."
tt0414177,"I must point out that unlike most viewers of the Fairly Odd Parents, I am an adult and am not ashamed to admit I like the show. Thanks to clever writing and unusually good stories with likable characters, this is one kids' show that parents can not just tolerate but enjoy. Heck, I think I know more about this show than most of my students I teach--it's just a neat show that doesn't insult the audience's intelligence.There is an expression many of you have probably heard about TV shows. It's called ""jumping the shark"". That's when you have a show that has been successful and executives at the network make an insane decision to seriously alter the show's chemistry because they fear that ratings will fall. In other words, it's an insane decision to mess with a great formula in the hopes that it will keep the show popular. In most every case, it only makes the downward spiral worse!! The phrase refers to the episode on ""Happy Days"" when Fonzie uncharacteristically jumped over a shark tank on his motorcycle--and it spelled the end of the series. On ""The Brady Bunch"" it was the introduction of 'Cousin Oliver' and on ""The Partridge Family"" it was in introduction of a supposedly cute little neighbor kid (who was even more nauseating than Cousin Oliver).In the case of ""The Fairly Odd Parents"", the show has actually ""jumped the shark"" on repeated occasions--a real rarity for a TV show. The JIMMY TIMMY POWER HOUR was the first time, though repeated Jimmy Neutron/Timmy Turner crossovers have since occurred AND they also made a musical (SCHOOL'S OUT) AND have introduced a Fairly Odd baby--which leads you to wonder how many times the big-wigs at Nickelodeon can mess with this series until there are no fans left or the show is so different from what fans love that there is no longer interest!! As for the JIMMY TIMMY POWER HOUR, it's initially a clever idea but that's all. The original formula is naturally destroyed and the show is painful and unfunny--a show parents would be loathe to watch again! I know I sure was."
tt0172495,"""Gladiator"" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple, but moving, story with beautiful scenery, filming, direction and score ¬ñ it is truly a ""complete"" movie.I am mostly compelled with the beautiful script which in a way reminds me of poetry, though it is still everyday language. I love the acting portrayed by the late Oliver Reed and also Richard Harris. Russell Crowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less ""popular"" artists who also deserve a big ""bravo"". Amongst them I have to mention ex-Mr Universe Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the movie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV Star and actress Ruth Frendo, who although has a small part, she is totally brilliant and outstanding.Actually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the internet, in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was lucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese production. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but she is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will definitely be seeing more of her work in the future...The scenery used for ""Gladiator"" is brilliant ¬ñ and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks to the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal feel to the entire movie.""Gladiator"" deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received, and for those of you who still haven't gone and watched it ¬ñ I can assure you that it will be well worth your time and money. So go on and rent it now!"
tt0372784,"After being disillusioned by just about every comic book ""blockbuster"" of recent times, Batman Begins comes as a nice surprise. The film draws a lot of visual inspiration from Blade Runner and looks all the more impressive for it. The storytelling is done at a decent pace, giving each stage just enough time to have an impact before moving on. On the acting front Michael Cane as Alfred steals the show serving as the comic relief. Katie Holmes is a bit disappointing but her role is largely forgettable. Christian Bale does an excellent job of re-imagining Bruce Wayne, even if he doesn't look quite right with the mask on. Just goes to show, with this and Sin City looks like Hollywood can do Comic Books....."
tt1345836,"I for one, seem to be one of the only reviewers who did not see this film in IMAX, probably for the best, for instead of being engulfed in the ""Imax experience,"" I actually got a chance to concentrate on the individual nuances of the movie.First and foremost, the pro's: I must commend the character of Bane, for his physique and menacing intellect do justice to the Bane of the comic realm (Knightfall/Knightsend era).Unfortunately, thats about as nice as I can be with this flick, Anne Hathaway was absolutely ridiculous in her role, I still cannot even begin to fathom how director Christopher Nolan could try to make a ""down to earth"" style Batman and include such a cheesy character.The imagery in the third installment was incredibly bright considering the dark subject manner. I expect more from Christopher Nolan, for the cinematography in the first two chapters did Batman justice, while this one fell and looked completely bland and boring.The plot holes were many and the movie seemed to drag, almost as if Nolan was trying too hard to out-due his prior installments. A horrid display of an over budget, over zealous mess, that never once even hinted at anything remotely imaginative or new.If you like your movies ridiculously predictable and cheesy than put The Dark Knight Rises on your must see movies, if not, do what I'm going to do, wait for an adaptation of any of the Alan Moore or Frank Miller Batman stories (fingers crossed)."
tt0313792,"I had some hope for this one early on. Allen is very hit and miss, but there's always that hope that this will be a hit, and it was interesting seeing him play a character who is in many ways the antithesis of his normal character.Unfortunately, Allen has just transfered his normal neurotic characteristics to another actor, the forgettable Biggs. Allen managed to get away with playing whiny, self-involved, selfish people because he's funny and has a certain goofy charm, but Biggs fails to make anything out of the tedious dialog Allen gives him. Biggs' character is a creep, his girlfriend is high-maintenance and even more selfish, her mother is possibly worse, and it is beyond me why anyone would want to spend time with these people. The movie also is a classic example of a Woody Allen movie where everyone is basically the same character with the same interests and the same attitudes (the reason I disliked the overrated Hannah and her Sisters), making the movie little more than a long monologue split up between several actors. Allen's own character is the least painful but not much funnier than the rest, and the movie fails as a comedy if it's trying to be one, and fails as a drama if that's what it's going for.I made it about half way through, hoping it would pick up, or reveal some sort of purpose, but then I just couldn't take it any more."
tt0139414,"I have to admit that I might only think this movie is not bad because I heard such horrible reviews for it, that when I actually saw it, I was like ""That wasn't bad at all."" I'm sure if I had heard it was great and saw it, I probably would have said ""Really? That sucked."" But I honestly didn't mind it at all. It had it's moments. The only real problem I had with it that got more and more irritating was whoever wrote the sarcastic one liners for this movie must have thought they were a lot more hilarious than they were. All of Hector's (Oliver Platt) sarcastic come back's to the sheriff were SO irritating and annoying. I love sarcasm, but whoever wrote those come back's and one liners must be an idiot who thinks that anything u say in a mean and sarcastic way is funny. Like when they're in the boat and Hector says to the sheriff something to the affect of ""When friends or family say things, they tend not to register, so sometimes it helps hearing it from a total stranger...you're fat."" Was that really supposed to sound clever? And his ""Oh my, the earth is round and so should you be"" line he says to him was so wannabe original and unfunny. ESPECIALLY since Oliver Platt is fat too! Which makes it even more annoying. And when Hector gets surprised while setting a trap at night and they start arguing and he says to the sheriff ""These traps could save your life. And the longer you live, the more sex you get to have with your SISTER!"" He yelled that line so loud and angry and annoying, like it was supposed to be a good one. So dumb. My wish is that the writer sees this review. Lol. I want him to know what a dumb as* he is. Not for the whole movie. Just for his attempt at good sarcastic humor. Sorry for harping so long about it. Just really almost ruins the movie. Bette White has a few lines like that too. And the only reason i'm not complaining about those is because of the fact that Bette White actually made them funny. Which no one else probably could have. Aside from all that, the movie isn't that bad at all. Just be prepared to be annoyed. Unless u actually have a lame sense of humor, and confuse lame sarcasm, with actual creative and witty sarcasm. :-)"
tt0296549,"I had the very good fortune to be part of this special!As a child, my mom and dad would allow me to sneak into the living room after my younger sister would be put to bed so that I could stay up later and watch my favorite show; THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW! I had always dreamed of going to California to see a taping of the show but by the time I was old enough, after college, the show had been off the air. While stopping by at CBS to look for other show taping tickets I came across tickets to A REUNION! My dream come true, I thought! My partner and I dressed up and waited on line with others to get into the taping, knowing that seating would not be guaranteed. We got in but our seats were to the side and rear. Somehow a single seat became available in the center and the usher was looking for ""a single"" to fill the seat. I jumped at the opportunity to move in closer. I could not wait for my opportunity to raise my hand and ask a question. My question would be about the infamous ""dentist office"" scene with Tim and Harvey, asking what was going on in the scene that made them break-up so much? I swear I can remember watching that scene when it aired originally, laughing until it hurt! I don't think Carol, Harvey, Tim, Lyle or Vicki know how much their show contributed to my childhood memories and how they inspired me to go into show business. Although I am not now nor may I ever be famous, as an actor, I have been given the gift of being able to make people laugh while I am on stage.This is a terrific trip down memory lane for anyone who stayed up late on Monday nights to watch Carol Burnett. I just hope it will get released on DVD soon!"
tt0372784,"Well...this is just another bad action movie based on a comic book -that has nothing to do with the original book. First of all ,the movie has changed the entire character of Bruce Wayne -he's not an arrogant one like Christian Slater's acting ;he's more like a quite rich and respected gentleman who's life as a superhero are way different and separated then his life as another everyday person. And besides -the batmobile is just ridiculous in the movie -I mean ,a heavy kind of an armored tank....? what's wrong with you people?...the batmobile is way different in the book ,not mentioning all the unnecessary special effects around the movie and the random sequence of events (bad scrips and bad writing...). In conclusion: dry ,boring ,another pointless remake -too overrated and too hyped."
tt0422272,"The location shots and overall setting on the Isle of Wight are wonderful. The movie also has several eerie moments and likable characters (all the kids, Helen, the old ladies). But, it's a formulaic paranormal tale seen time and time again. While a horror film, some aspects were so implausible (the reason for shutting off the second floor without even explaining the other floors above it as well...) I couldn't get passed them. The acting was pretty good. Even Calista Flockhart did well, even though a different actress would have been more suitable in my eyes (cue Julianne Moore please). Through most of the film, Ms. Flockhart maintained her waifish, 'I'd rather be anywhere else in the world right now' appeal. The paranormal antagonist was interesting. But, why was she nude? That was definitely unneeded."
tt1853728,"I've enjoy the movie, it was nicely written, story was good. went we reach 2h, at the point Dr. King Schultz was suppose to end the deal with Calvin Candie ( Leonardo DiCaprio ). Then the UNNECESSARY BLOOD S.H.I.T START for another 45 min.USELESS, POINTLESS BLOOD S.H.I.T.Would be great that HE DID SHAKE HAND, come back to kill Clavin Candie who care, but all the shooting destroy all the effort to make a GREAT MOVIE.They don't go GOOD MOVIE as they Use to do :( it always as to come with Kill the human ASP.Too bad the first 2h was AMAZING ! GREAT STORY"
tt0108052,"This movie treats one of the most important subjects of our century, i.e. the national socialist movement in europe which could have ended up in a disaster.The acting and the cinematography are as good as it gets! However, since the purpose of the film is to be some kind of document on what happened in the camps in Germany and Poland during the nazi-period, I find the fact that Spielberg is making up things in the movie, such as the shooting of innocent jews from the balcony of a residence, somehow takes away much of its value as a document over history. My opinion is that there is no need for making up things and making them worse than they actually were in order to make a good movie about this era. Things were bas enough as they were; there is no need for making things up, especially things that couldn't even have happened (the location of the villa makes it impossible to shoot jews from the balcony).To conclude: I find this to be a movie, well worth seing! However, it is not to be seen as a documentation of what really happened, which in my opinion is very unfortunate since that would have given this movie yet another dimension. In my eyes, this dimension would compensated for the loss of some of the more dramatic scenes in the movie. I guess my historian background somehow blew it for me."
tt0167260,"Let me say first that after seeing Fellowship of the Ring, I went out and read the LOTR trilogy for the first time. I enjoyed it immensely, but I only read it once and not before I saw the first movie. So I might not be what you'd consider a true enthusiast.From an Enthusiasts perspective:There were a few disappointing momemts: the fact that Gandalf *still* didn't break Sarumon's staff on screen, and the way a lot of things were glossed over a bit. Additionally, there was way too much Legolas jumping around during battles. I understand they cost $9 million to make and not showing them would be effectively ""wasting"" $9 million, but there are more important things to show.Finally, and this was known very early on so it wasn't a surprise, the conclusion of the trilogy was completely removed. This trilogy began and ended with the Hobbits. It began by exposing them as lovable but helpless characters, and ended showing them to be courageous and capable of addressing significant problems. The movies, however, focused a little more on the characters people love, and while I don't fault them for that, I do fault them for not trying to show the ending of the trilogy in any way whatsoever. As an enthusiast, I can't grade the movie on its own; I must rate it as a trilogy. And this trilogy would get 9.5 / 10.From Joe's perspective:Joe wouldn't be nearly as acquanted with the characters, and a lot of what this movie succeeds on for the enthusiasts plays off of that. This is still a good movie, if a bit broken up giving far too many ""it's wrapping up"" signals. Frodo spends far too much time crying (honestly, this dragged on), and the characters spend far too much time saying ""farewell."" Joe liked the movie, but gave it a 7.0 / 10 because there are movies he simply enjoys more."
tt0167260,"This morning I was sitting in Japanese literature class, while Murakami's Novel ""A Wild Sheep Chase"" was being discussed, and a student so boldly suggested a number of parallels between it and ""The Lord of The Rings."" To my dismay a majority of the students in the class started to giggle, thinking this comment was almost a joke. What's sad about it, is that his points were valid and made perfect sense. He was comparing the Murakami novel's narrative, characters, and moral messages to LOR, and it was a most convincing comparison. Literally everything from how the characters are similar to how the plot concludes is very similar.Based on the class reaction, I have to ask, when did Lord of the Rings cease to be literature and become another Hollywood movie? 15 years ago, if the same comparison were made, people would value it and even consider it. Before LOR became a movie it was one of the most read books in the 20th century and its readership and importance in a country like Japan was present. So why couldn't this parallel exist? After all Murakami was and is heavily influenced by Western literature.Before this class, I only criticized LOR as a film in itself, and gave it credit for exposing people to a classic story. In fact, I'm pretty sure these movies will introduce millions more to the books. But now I feel differently. The lack of integrity these movies possess will pollute the books and therefore reduce their real cultural importance. When I watch these movies, I see Hollywood on a grand scale. I see little of what is in the novels and instead see an inverse effect from what I expected. Now when I consider the novel I can only picture the dumb-wit characters, so shallow and bland following the plot line like a trail of breadcrumbs. If I could go back and reverse the money and time I wasted watching these films I would. In fact, I wouldn't suggest them to anyone, because they in no way enhance the original work. I'm not critical of film adaptations of novels in many cases. Don't get me wrong. A great filmmaker can take a great novel and show you things about it that you could have never thought of yourself. He or she can interpret a work of literature as the original author originally interpreted reality itself. Italian and Japanese cinema seem to have a good track record of adaptations, but American cinema¬Ö Its %@#$! Please don't butcher anymore great works.Please.... Leave something for those who actually care about art."
tt0120815,"The opening 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan are some of the most brutal images put on screen. I don't care what you've seen before, this is absolutely shocking. There were times when it was difficult to watch these events flash in front of my eyes. War is not pretty, and Speilberg shows you this in a way that will grab you, a man holding his intestines is crying for his mother, another man who loses an arm confusingly tries to pick it up with his other hand. You know that this is not gonna be a pretty ride.Saving Private Ryan is Speilberg's follow up to last year's highly underrated film, Amistad. Tom Hanks is Captain Miller, who gets word of Private Ryan (Matt Damon), who lost all of his brothers in the war (he still doesn't know it yet), Private Ryan is therefore granted a safe trip back home, and it's up to Captain Miller and seven others to make sure that he makes his return home as soon as possible. The only problem is that they don't know exactly where he is, just somewhere behind enemy lines. The eight begin their journey and on their way each of their characters are revealed, we find out that Captain Miller, as tough as he is, wants nothing more than to get out of the violence and tragedy that he has to deal with everyday. He just wants to return home, as does almost everybody else.Speilberg is in top form again, and although it's not as perfect as his masterpiece, Schindler's List, it does rank as the best film of 1998 (so far). The performances are top-notch and incredibly real, especially Tom Hanks' character.So what can you say? Speilberg has done it again. Never before has war been shown so realistically before. If there is one film that can show the atrocities that soldiers had to go through every day, SPR is the one. Is it the best war film ever made?... I don't think so. But is it a damn good one?... definitely"
tt0109842,"While this film was a bit corny and poorly acted, it was still poignant in its storytelling techniques. The idea of kids being drug dealers isn't at all improbable, and the lives they seek out seem conducive with the consequences of following such a path in life. Not a very memorable film, but is still an interesting commentary on inner-city culture."
tt0167260,"I have been an avid LOTR fan for almost ten years now. I love love love love the books, but I really hated this movie.What Jackson did (and I'm surprised Phillipa or Christopher didn't call him out on it) was cut all the really important ending bits for sake of having disgustingly overblown battle sequences that made me want to kill myself. An hour is too long to be in battle, in a movie, I'm sorry. The CGI was amazing, and the deaths were good and all, but it didn't really help the story along. All it did was sit there. And we aren't even going to get into how much I hate Orlando Bloom.The fact that the scenes in the houses of healing were cut just pisses me off. Faramire and Eowyn deserved more than a glance during Aragorn's OMG SPIFFY coronation. They were the the link between Gondor and Rohan. They were actually quite major characters, and they were totally glossed over for the sake of some Oliphants falling over. Butchery? Yes, yes it is.And the endings. The endings weren't long enough. I know what you're thinking, ""but... the ending dragged on and on with no sign of an end in sight until it actually ended"", but seriously folks, don't give me that BS unless you've read the books as many times as I have (if you have, then by all means, give me that BS many people have read them more times then I have, but those people would agree with me) when Peter Jackson decided to use his ""artistic"" license to completely forget about half of the stuff in the books, he cheated people out of some seriously amazing story telling. The scouring of the Shire is what the whole trilogy is supposed to be about. It's about how Frodo leaves hating how much the hobbits take for granted in life, and then coming back, and helping to save them from something they have never before had the displeasure of meeting, and that is slavery. And then when they won their freedom back, they loved their heroes, and they celebrated them, and they were happy again, and they (hopefully) wouldn't take so much for granted again in the future.Okay, I'm getting myself upset, and I'll shut up. But seriously, all this movie is for is watching people run around and stab things. Not interesting to me."
tt7286456,"I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life's simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I'm a happy bunny. I will not let life's current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world's expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger's Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an ""Origins"" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What's his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker's mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It's about ""Why?""And now I see ""Why?""So now ask yourself... ""Why so serious?"""
tt0133093,"After seeing this movie it changed the way i will look at sci-fi movies for the rest of my life. This film was taken straight from the imagination of the Wachowski. The amazing special effects drove this film along with great sound editing and dialog. Just in case you don't know i will tell you the main plot of the movie. Neo is just an average guy who ends up being hunted by Agent Smith. HE ends up being one of the crew members with Morpheus and Trinity. Morpheus thinks that Neo is ""The One"" which means that this person would be very strong and can dodge bullets and do wild stuff like that.The reason so many people loved this movie was because it was so out of this world and no one else not even Mr.Spielberg could have done this movie because only two brothers could have brought this to life and made one of the best sci-fi sagas ever made(tied with the ""Alien"" saga) and make remembered through generations, so i hope when i get old this movie will still be remembered because it is simply amazing."
tt0120737,"There was not much I liked about this film, outside of the first half-hour or so.  I had very little problem with the plot alterations for the sake of converting the book to film, I think they did an admirable job with that.My concerns with the film as compared to the book were more about the feel and atmosphere.  Using Merry and Pippin as little more than comic relief?  A clumsy, pointless love scene between Strider and Arwen?  Saruman as a B-movie bad guy?  Countless teary and dreadfully unsubtle cornpone scenes of loyalty and friendship?  It felt like they took the outline of the standard Hollywood movie and happened to find bits of The Fellowship of the Ring to shove into the appropriate places (except for having an actual ending of course).You can change the plot to fit it into a film, but when you change the whole feeling until the only recognition is plot bits and character names, you have a loser in my book."
tt0468569,"The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that I'm not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot.Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), I'm not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him.My inability to empathise with the characters wasn't helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker weren't enough to keep the film going.As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadn't been as good as I was hoping it would be."
tt1345836,"I loved the first two Batmans because he was Batman, but this one was such a let down! There wasn't one moment where the audience or anyone in the movie was like ""wow thats Batman!"". I kept thinking: ""after this scene they are really going to make him come back"" and then, ""oh after this scene we are really going to see Batman!"". Never happened. I am pretty sure if I had counted he probably only put the suit on five times the whole movie and they tore him down never to bring him back up in any real Batman capacity. Basically the entire movie was him getting his you know what kicked. And the end was left open too. I am so disappointed."
tt0172495,"This movie is in so many ways wannabe movie. Cinematography is good, but the story is missing something. Russell Crowe is not the best choice for the role of gladiator. Most of the movie he mumbles in his chin so you cannot understsnd the half of what he's saying. Maybe if he spoke Latin, we would understand him better. It's too distracting.Also, movie is kinda 'good vs bad' which makes it flat and boring. One of the main characters, Lucilla is a tragic but too pretentious character so you cannot sympathise with her neither.The main character is general turned gladiator, but the actor is too chubby and fat to play such a character. Soldiers and especially gladators in the anciant Roman Empire were the 3% body fat type of people, with limited access to food and all day hard trainings. This guy came out of war chubby and even when he became gladiator he still remained chubby after all that torture and hard training. It's confusing. Actor for that role cannot be 'all you can eat 24/7 buffer' type of person. Another proof that this is miss cast.Only good thing in the movie is scenography, Roman amphiteater in particular. And music."
tt0816692,"Note - the last two lines sum it all up if you want to skip my blathering. Interstellar is nothing more than a sci-fi drama. If you crave sci-fi movies as I do, this film will leave you feeling unfulfilled and usurped. It is about nothing more than ""the human element"" set against a semi sci-fi backdrop that is obscenely absurd. Happy ending? Not really, and what makes it worse is that's predictable early on. Should you bother to watch this film? Yes, I watch them all, probably because curiosity gets the best of me, and who knows, you might like it. I have been disappointed, read enraged, by other films much more than this one, but it failed to impress me. Maybe if I had sat down to this one expecting to be disappointed it might have been better, but to be quite honest, the trailers make it out to be something totally different than what you get. Sad thing is, too much film marketing goes this same way these days."
tt1853728,"The story and the acting were good but the implementation could have been better. The main character is nothing more than a black Clint Eastwood, so in that respect it's kind of a rip-off of his spaghetti westerns. The musical score is terrible. It doesn't come close to matching the era or the scenes themselves. Gunfights are very graphic and most will find them over the top. It's not something I'd put in my collection, neither is it something that is good for repeated viewing. Everyone seems to give it rave reviews but I think it's because they are just Tarantino movie fans and are letting his reputation feed into their opinion."
tt0108052,"Look guys, it 2015, at this point we've pretty much nailed the concept of colour in films. How am I supposed to stay awake through a film without there being streams of colours and explosions everywhere.Okay, I guess might have just been a mistake on the part of Steven Spielberg (one of the worst directors of this generation producing such messes as: Jaws, Jurassic Park and Raider of the Lost Ark). This doesn't excuse him from taking all of the colour out of the film. It's just not exciting and it's not engaging.I'll tell you what's a good film, Psycho. You know, that Vince Vaughn film where he is a murderman who stabs a naked lady. It used colour terrifically to show blood going into a bath hole. It is really good.I can't see why Steven Spielberg can't just be more like Vince Vaughn. That large man is just a genius of the silver screen.Truly, this film deserves a 1 out of 10."
tt0120737,"Although it may not be entirely faithful to the book, Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy perfectly captures the essence of J.R.R. Tolkein's fantasy classic: it's magical, imaginative and completely unforgettable, but also extremely long and a little hard going at times. Those who stay the distance, however, seem to agree that a bit of perseverance is well worth it in the end.The Fellowship of the Ring is perhaps the most laborious of the three films, what with the setting up of the plot, the introduction of a multitude of characters, and several talky scenes eating into the 171 minutes running time, but thankfully the film's impressive fantasy fighting action, breath-taking scenery, and amazing performances more than make up for the duller moments.All in all, I found The Fellowship of the Ring to be an admirable start for this ambitious attempt at bringing Tolkein's complex fantasy epic to the screen."
tt0108052,I saw this Movie once and in my opinion is this title not really that i wouldn't suggest anyone.
tt0102926,"Having read both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, and having seen the movie adaptations of each (in that order), this movie was somewhat disappointing to me. My two major complaints are with the pace and with some of the acting.To start, the pace of the movie as compared to the book is cut all to hell. Of course things would need to be shortened or refitted from novel to feature length movie, but much of the insight into several characters and their relationships is either rushed or utterly lost. Jack Crawford's personal back story, for instance, is completely left out; this leaves Scott Glen nothing to work with, though we know from past roles that he is at least an able actor Jodie Foster is contemptible as Clarice Starling. In T. Harris's well-written book, she is portrayed as frustrated and sometimes disturbed, but able, rebellious and determined. In this movie she is almost constantly falling apart and is barely able to keep herself together. Further, the reason for involving her so heavily in the case, while addressed in the book, is never properly explained here.To the movie's credit, and ironically, the characters we are supposed to like least are the most believable, and provoke the most reaction: Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, Anthony Heald as Dr. Chilton and of course Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.With a change of director, and screenwriter Ted Tally's growth over 11 years, Red Dragon is much more reflective of its source material, much more insightful, has a much better lead actor and is simply better all around. One will enjoy this movie as a thriller IF one does not first read the book, or see the much more ably-handled Red Dragon."
tt1375666,"I will try not to repeat some of what others have so brilliantly written in some reviews. I just add this in order to contradict the hype that has allowed this movie to be ranked so high in IMDb. The same has been happening with other movies, and that is a shame for IMDb, which is becoming unreliable.I want to stress the fact that the only complexity in this movie is trying to figure out how you can invest so much money in a script that continuously makes a fool of the average critic intelligent viewer! The story is not complex. It is deliberately confusing in order to conceal its stupidity. Nothing that really matters is explained in the movie.And there's so many embarrassing clich√©s (the recruiting of the team, the episode in Mombassa, the assault of the ice fortress, many of the action sequences)... the average viewer must be disappointed!And the dreams - which serve as the scenario to most of the movie - are populated by the utmost lack of imagination.Finally, there's the score, louder and louder, building a suspense that is never there, for everything is a dream, and we do not quite catch what there is exactly that can go wrong...Well, all in all, the movie is an insult to the average intelligent viewer and, having been directed by Christopher Nolan, an ultimate disappointment."
tt1345836,"Christopher Nolan did a great job on the two first films. His greatness came to be in combining a complex rich story with even more complex and interesting characters.No doubt that this is an epic movie in a lot of ways. The score, the directing, the visual effects. Everything is done with utmost precision and thought, but, one thing is lacking - Plot and even more important is the Character motives.There is no explanation to why so many people follow Bane (or why goddamn no one shot him down), or why bane himself is so devoted to the concept of the league of shadows. So is Miranda. Nor why exactly cat woman does what she does if it's helping batman or helping Bain. I wouldn't go about complaining about the love story between Batman and Catwoman which simply came to be without any explanations. There are many plot holes: mainly about the nuclear bomb (that came to be known by the bad guys after they kidnapped the nuclear physicist).Well the whole story itself and many scenes were just really CHESSY; like the one that Catwoman fight off one of Bain Henchman so that the poor little kid could have his stolen shiny red apple, the anthem scene and many others. Watching this movie you feel as Nolan didn't have put much effort to write an interesting script.In conclusion, just another breathtaking full of action and special effects summer movie, Nothing more."
tt0120737,"did I ruin the film by reading the books years ago?  I had the strangest feeling watching this incredibly praised film that I live in an alternative universe where we were forced to watch a rather tiresome version of the film.  I was ecstatic to hear all the critics praising the film, ecstatic to hear all the early viewers praising the film, but it certainly didn't live up to the hype that it had been given.Minor Spoilersthere were many things that disappointed me in the film - the shallow characters and comedy relief that Pippen and Merry play, the whole council of Elrond, the battle of the wizards, and, my god, the final ""let's hunt some orc"" nonsense from Aragorn.  Hey Peter Jackson, couldn't you just take a couple more days and make sure some of those scenes were done a little better?the battle scenes were good.  hollywood certainly knows how to show someone getting sliced up or beheaded nowadays.  but I just had a hard time finding the soul of the movie.spoilers endmaybe if some critics had said that they didn't know what all the fuss was about, then I would have gone in with lower standards, and maybe on some rainy end of winter day, i'll give it another chance, but for now I believe that millions have somehow been duped into believing that this is a great movie (""the best of all time"" as too many imdb reviews state).honestly, and this hurts because I was such a fan of the book, i have to give it a 6 out of 10."
tt0172495,"It wasn't surprising really. I should have known better, after all this had happened with the narratives in Legend, 1492.., Black Rain and even in his superior works Alien and Blade Runner(and will happen again, like Peter Pan?). Hope however springs eternal, and with the casting of Derick Jacobi some comparisons with the sublime I, Claudius were inevitably and subconsciously drawn. How desperately in need of those comparisons was this dire cocktail of flashy, confusing gore and risible 'intrigue' performed by a collection of actors who, with a few exceptions, appeared to have recourse to one facial expression to express the gamut of emotions required of them by an infantile, ludicrous and totally implausible script which took 2 1/2 hours to deliver a plot which could have been written on the back of a postage stamp.Are we so easily satisfied with mediocrity that we can praise this ramshackle, gloomy hi-tech affair as being the first 'epic' of the year 2000? Surely not. Even the highpoints of the film; the opening battle scenes and the chariots vs gladiators coliseum fight come nowhere near to matching the virtuoso displays in Saving Private Ryan and Spartacus.For the rest, give me a script instead of computer-generated images which if I want to watch I can do so on one of my son's computer games.Now if Mr Jacobi had been a screenwriter ..."
tt1345836,"The most anticipated movie of the year has arrived, and I'm sorry to say, but at least for this moviegoer, it disappoints. The Dark Knight Rises is such an overly ambitious film that it tries to pack in way more than it can handle. I know I am in the minority here, but by the final hour of the movie all that I really felt was overkill.This is the capper in Christopher Nolan's trilogy which re-booted the franchise and did indeed make it more respected than it was after the last few Batman films of the 90's. This series has a much darker tone which I always preferred over the lighter fare of other superhero movies like the Spider-Man ones. The dark tone still works well here, but it's hindered by the blown-up storyline. Just as many people observed with Spider-Man 3, there's just too much going on here. It's not that the new characters of Bane and another Catwoman are what bring the film down; it's just that everything is so dragged out in scene after scene. In fact, the re-introduction of Catwoman was one of the things that worked best. I've never been much of a fan of Anne Hathaway, but her scenes were often the best ones. This is a much smarter and slicker Catwoman than we've ever seen before. And that's exactly what you should expect of a character of that name. Maybe a little more of her and less of some other characters would have served the movie well.Aside from a drawn-out plot about Batman (Christian Bale) being gone for 8 years and Bruce Wayne trying to get his alter-ego mojo back, it seems like the movie tries a little too hard to give ample screen time to all of the other actors as well. It wants to make sure that returning veterans like Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman are properly accounted for along with all the new guys played by Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Matthew Modine, and Anne Hathaway. This results in many unnecessary scenes in my opinion. There's also a little surprise about one of the characters at the end of the film, but it was something I had already figured out at the beginning. And while the primary villain Bane (played by Tom Hardy) is menacing in his physical appearance, it is a little odd that they chose to give him a voice that sounds like an old geezer from England.All in all, The Dark Knight Rises was just a bit of a letdown for me. It's not that the expectations were so high that they were hard to live up to, but I actually found this Batman film to be the worst in the trilogy. I have noticed that each one of them has a prolonged climax at the end, but this one seemed 3 times as long and I found myself zoning out while trying to stay interested. At 2 hours and 45 minutes, it really just became a movie loaded with a lot of filler. I mean Malcolm X was 35 minutes longer, yet didn't feel nearly as long as this. There's nothing wrong with a lengthy film as long as each of the scenes are interesting or important to the story. In this case, they were not."
tt0361748,"(No spoilers.) Lawrence Bender (Tarantino's Producer since Reservoir Dogs) in an interview about Inglorious Basterds said that it had the layers of Pulp Fiction but with more maturity, because, in fairness, Quentin's had 15 years to grow, learn and develop, although his last two outings of Death Proof and Kill Bill showed little sign of the writer/Director maturing, merely stamping his mark on genres that weren't in the spotlight, and in some ways, recreating them.So, did Inglorious Basterds live up to this claim of the new and matured Quentin Tarantino? Well, yes and no. Tarantino's staple dialogue, when not pushing a story, is often crude. That, for once, is not the case with Inglorious Basterds, so perhaps that can be taken as a sign of maturity. The dialogue is excellent, as expected, but at times without the poetic rhythm that his first three pictures had in abundance. The only drawback of this is that on rare occasions you'll find that you've zoned out for a moment, but, with a Tarantino film, you can be pretty damn sure that you'll be seeing it a few times anyway and you'll be able to catch up on missed dialogue. It is dialogue heavy, which today's audience seem to shy away from, but for me personally, I love to see a film driven by its script rather than its special effects.The story is layered in true Tarantino fashion. I do feel that the Basterds themselves could have been developed more, since there are many and we get to know so few, however this isn't a small film like Reservoir Dogs, revolving around a group of Basterds as the trailer makes out, and there are plenty of wonderful characters to compensate for it.Also, as we've come to expect, the film is violent, which I didn't think would bother me, but it's the only thing that left a slightly bitter taste in my mouth. I'm pretty desensitised to violence on screen and have been for many years, but I expected the violence of Inglourious Basterds to be understandable under the topic of War. I also expected a few points to emphasise the cruelty and senseless of war, but I found that in many ways this was a glorification of war and Quentin has used it as a playing field for his imagination without considering the consequences. As Uncle Ben taught us in Spiderman, ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and when I was going into Inglourious Basterds, I felt that the uneducated audience who love Tarantino might leave this film having learnt a few things. Sadly, I don't feel that is the case, and for me that is its only downfall. It's becoming more and more obvious that Quentin Tarantino makes the films that Quentin Tarantino wants to see, and while that is precisely why they're so good, I do find that if he was a little less self indulgent he could make something just as hip, funky, violent and entertaining, but with more depth.However, as a crafted piece of work, in script, style and care, it fires on all cylinders. I do not believe that a Tarantino film will ever not live up to the standards we've come to expect and I honestly feel that he is the most reliable director in the world today, but I can't help feeling that while people are calling this a more mature piece of work, the reality is that his first two ventures on the big screen were in fact more mature and with less glorified violence than what he is making now.Be that as it may, he is one of the few Director's who I feel is really worthy of the title 'Artist', and if somebody is an Artist then they should be free to make what they want. Tarantino is fortunate enough to be able to make what he wants without being hampered by producers, and I suppose in the end, I wouldn't want it any other way.So check it out when you can and see what you think.Peace."
tt0397103,"The characterization in this movie is among the worst I've ever encountered. The dialogue is trite and clich√© to the point of extreme distraction. None of the issues the characters face are developed at all--they're merely surface details intended to get a point across without having to actually come up with believable dialogue to support said point. Also, the depiction of the Chinese characters leaves a bit to be desired--I find it hard to believe that the Chinese father learns flawless English from a book(or so it is implied in one scene) so he can teach it to his daughter. Etc.The Smile Train is a great organization and it's a nice idea, to make a heartstring-tugging film about the impact a program like this can have on kids' lives, but overall, I found this movie to be more frustrating than anything."
tt0120737,"I wish I could like this movie more, because I think Jackson *gets* Tolkien, and really makes an effort to get it right.But I just don't think Tolkien's novel is filmable. Film inevitably misses the richness and depth that makes the novel great. The visuals are undeniably beautiful, but it's all surface. At best, the film works as a sort of moving illustration of the novel."
tt0361748,"Yeah, it's exciting, violent, and with some highlights, but while it's effective in spurts, we can only wonder when Lt. Tarantino will learn some new tactics."
tt1345836,"First of all you should watch Batman Begins and Dark Knight before this. This movie gets back to events of both of those movies. This is not as good as previous movies because this has few things that feel so stupid that you start to think why they are on movie.Batmans war tactics seem to be from before World War I and this movie seems to have some kind of fair fist fight fixation. Police seems to be stupid and doing things that makes no sense only because plot requires it.Another annoying thing is messing with time space continuity. In real life characters can't move that fast between places they seems to do this movie. Unnecessary time limit at the end is one of those too convenient things.Bane is quite interesting. His master plan is not. There is no motivation for what makes him do things he do. Movie would have benefit better explanations of motives.Catwoman is not called Catwoman in this movie and she has too little part for my liking.Best things about movie is how it ties story lines from first two movies and shows why good ideas from earlier movies weren't so good after all. Good ending to great trilogy. If characters motivations were explained better and they wouldn't done few of those stupid things, this would have been on level of previous ones."
tt0109830,"He may have been good in Philadelphia but be is excellent in Forrest Gump.Tom Hanks delivers another great performance in his career by portraying the lovable,king yet not so intelligent character Forrest Gump.It is also Tom Hanks' second straight win for the Best Actor Oscar which he becomes the second man to do said accomplishment after Spencer Tracy.Whilst not as dramatic as Philadelphia,Tom Hanks' performance is just as great in this movie and this movie could possibly be the film of Tom Hanks' career as he used to be a comedy guy who turned to drama in a way which would paved for future stars such as Jim Carrey(The Truman Show),Reese Witherspoon(Walk the Line) and Will Ferrell(Stranger Than Fiction) to name a few.Also staring in this great movie classic are Robin Wright-Penn who plays Jenny,Gary Sinise who was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Lieutenant Dan Taylor,Mykelti Williamson as Forrest's best friend and shrimper Benjamin Buford""Bubba"" Blue and Sally Field as Mrs.Gump.This film was nominated for a total of thirteen Academy Awards but won six of them which include Best Film Editing,Best Visual Effects,Best Adapted Screenplay,Best Picture,Best Director-Robert Zemeckis and Best Actor-Tom Hanks.This is one masterpiece of a movie that will not be forgotten about in a long time.Bravo!"
tt1345836,"Batman Begins was a nearly perfect origin story, The Dark Knight is among the best sequels ever, and probably the finest comic book film ever made.. the third entry however is almost like everybody was ""well let's just be done with this trilogy, people will love it anyway!"" and most people actually did.. But the truth is this is full of plotholes or just lazy writing, dumb moments and worst of all wasted potential!This could have been so good, the premise is great, the talent behind it(both behind and in front of the camera) is phenomenal and yet for every good, cool or awesome thing in this, there are twice as many irritating, stupid and downright counter-productive moments that tear down important points the first two movies established. The villains plan from the first movie for Gotham doesn't make any sense anymore.. the whole point of the end of the second movie loses it's meaning.. the ending is absolutely atrocious and goes against the character of Batman and also is cringeworthy as hell.. This whole movie is a mess!"
tt0422272,"Troubled American nurse Amy (a fine, credible, and affecting performance by Calista Flockhart) gets a job working the night shift at the crumbling Mercy Falls Children's Hospital in Britain. The place is being closed down. Amy discovers that there's a dangerous and possessive spirit known as Charlotte the mechanical girl (a genuinely creepy portrayal by Karmeta Cervera) on a disused floor who refuses to let the child patients leave the hospital. Director Jaume Balaguero, who also co-wrote the thoughtful script with Jordi Galceran, relates the compelling story at a deliberate pace, does an expert job of creating and sustaining an eerie and unsettling atmosphere of pure dread and unease, makes wisely judicious use of both excessive graphic gore and flashy special effects, and pulls out all the harrowing stops for the thrilling climax. Moreover, Balaguero brings a classy and subtle sensibility and sensitivity to the material that kicks the overall quality of the movie up a few extra notches. The excellent acting from the tip-top cast rates as another substantial asset: Flockhart brings a touching and appealing vulnerability to her sympathetic character, with sterling support from Richard Roxburgh as the skeptical Dr. Robert Marcus, Elena Anaya as stern nurse Helen Perez, Gemma Jones as hard-nosed head administrator Mrs. Folder, Colin McFarlane as amiable handyman Roy, and, most impressive of all, the adorable Yasmin Murphy as frightened and precocious little girl Maggie. Xavi Gimenez's shadowy cinematography gives the picture an appropriately gloomy look. Roque Banos' shivery score does the elegantly uncanny trick. A real sleeper."
tt0109830,"This is one film that I have to say did not leave a lasting impression on me all of those years ago,but since many factors play a part in whether or not you enjoy a film,and since it is obviously an Oscar winner loved by many,I recently decided to give it a second chance viewing.I am happy to report that I have had a total change of heart.We have here a story about a young man who is,to say the least,seemingly a bit slower than you and I.Yet,unlike many who are slow,he gains fame and prestige.The sweet thing about Forrest Gump is that none of that fame and prestige ever seemed to be that important to him.True love is the only thing that he ever really wanted,yet it always seemed to evade him because the girl he loved was always running away to find herself.Foolishly,she couldn't see that where she belonged was where she always seemed to be when she failed to find herself elsewhere:right there with Forrest.With Forrest Gump,you will laugh at the way he stumbles his way through the history books,yet you will be touched at the way he touches those around him,and will cheer for him to find the love he deserves.You will ultimately learn that you don't have to have that much book smarts to know what is important in life."
tt1853728,"Probably the best Tarantino film in my opinion. But let's be fair, it's really close. Regardless, Django represents everything I appreciate about this director. Drama, comedy, amazing dialogue, extreme violence, etc. I named my dog after this masterpiece, so remember the D is silent!"
tt0109830,"I think this movie (I haven't read book) seems to have an agenda. The main character is mindless but works hard at everything, so he fits into the American Way. Part of his mindlessness is a basically loving nature. This movie is saying that as long as you pick a direction, work hard, put the needs of others before yourself, and be persistent then you will wind up ahead of the game. You will have a basis of wealth, a home, and you won't have un-necessarily exposed yourself to diseases of the mind or body.If, on the other hand, you have a mind and set out to change or improve conditions in the world, you are a fool.That's what I get from this and I am somewhat offended because if there is any credence to the philosophy that this movie advances, then I must be the fool.If anyone sees where I am wrong in my interpretation of this story I welcome comments, as I am very much in the beginning stages of analyzing stories. This one got me in particular.Anyway, the agenda that I am referring to would be Conservatism."
tt0137523,"This is one of my favorite films, the acting is top tier, I thought the story was captivating and interesting all the way through. Fantastic symbolism, character arcs, camera work, experimental scenes, etc. My one complaint would be that it is a pretty long movie and I usually have to split into 2 watch periods. However, I think it is a good length for the story being told, and would not be the same if it was any shorter. The end scene always gives me goosebumps. Will always recommend to anyone."
tt0120737,"This movie loses a lot from the book, and all it adds are a few special effects.The first five minutes are cool -- everybody seems to love that part.  Then the movie becomes too slow, too formulaic.  ""Look here, this is where you feel sad.  This is where you cheer.  This is where you say 'ooh, ahh'...""A movie can enhance a book by adding dialogue.  But in this film, the script is a series of monologues.  The characters give speech after speech, and it becomes hard to tell them apart because they're all approximately the same.When they're not talking, there are a few good action sequences, but most of the time it's characters posing, wallowing in self-pity."
tt0102926,"When this movie came out, I was just a kid, so it wasn't till years later that I saw it. I liked it, but didn't understand what the fuss was about. I found it quite lacking in many aspects, especially Jodie Foster's acting, which reminds me of a bad soap opera. I, simply, found that the movie was missing a lot of things.Then, a few years later, I read the book and saw just how much the movie missed, mostly in character portrayal. The only person who, actually, did the role right, was Scott Glenn, but it was never explained why he was always so sad and melancholic (his wife's illness and death).Ted Levine was also pretty good, I liked the way he played a psycho, especially since I've seen some of his more uptight and comic roles, eg., in Monk.As far as Hopkins goes, I think that Lecter suited him better in Hannibal and Red dragon. It seemed that he was so relaxed in the role. In this movie, not so much, but I don't think it was really his fault, being a truly great actor. Like I said, the overall character portrayal was bad.I, actually, don't like Jodie Foster that much, and her whiny Clarice is not much different from, say, Nell.Demme did capture the gruesome atmosphere really well and I have to give him that.Even though it is a good movie, it is not a great one and I certainly hope someone decides to do the book a little more justice some day."
tt7286456,"I liked Phoenix's performance, but thats about it for the movie. I've watched it twice and the second time didn't really enhance it any more, or really change my mind about my first impression.I know this is a general/simplified comparison, but Joker is Taxi Driver and King of Comedy mixed together with the Joker.The apartment killing and his note taking during a set are the best scene of the movie. Lightly mixing in the Batman wasn't really necessary either. It's pretty on the nose with its message about mental health issues, the system, class division, etc..Rental at best."
tt0108052,"Is it possible for Spielberg to make a film that isn't horrendously mawkish ? Can someone please turn off his sentimentality button ?Viewed nearly ten years after its making, this film's sole purpose of letting the world know how guilty we all should feel about the holocaust only serves to point up the horrors of the ongoing Israeli occupations in Palestine.I really don't feel that this is a particularly good film besides that.Ben Kingsley is insufferable, Ralph Fiennes hams it up, Liam Neeson sounds like The Count from Sesame Street.Spielberg has stated that he set out to make a memorial to the suffering of his people, and he has done a pretty good job of that. Unfortunately, his undoubted talents lie in the field of fantasy, not reality, and this self-indulgent polemic will not earn him his place in history."
tt0480025,"12-year-old bully victim Shaun (Thomas Turgoose) comes of age in Thatcher era working-class England, at a time when a part of the British skinhead culture is evolving into white nationalism. And we follow his inclusion into a much older gang of teens and young adults who give him friendship and a sense of belonging, but also a number of influences which test his moral compass. This clearly personal film written and directed by Shane Meadows finds a wonderful balance between humour and seriousness in its delve into rather bleak subject material. We're given an inside look into a fascinating, smouldering sub-culture where pride and unity clash with frustration and inferiority complexes. A wonderfully acted and intelligently directed picture with a refreshing lack of bias."
tt0133093,The Matrix is one of the most overrated films that I can think of. The film does have good action and some of the most amazing special effects ever put on a film. But the film is also drawn out and confusing. Keanu Reeves is the only one who could play a chacrter as flat as Neo and the rest of the cast expect for Laurence Fishburne and Joe Panotilano all give paper thin performances. I give the action and effects a 10 the plot a 3 which equals about 6.4.
tt0372784,"I was lucky enough to have seen the premiere of the movie on Monday evening and I was very impressed. This is easily the best Batman movie I have ever seen. This movie completely disregards the previous 4 Batman movies and begins its own franchise. The scenes are dark and foreboding, as is Batman himself. This film makes the previous 4 Batman films look as campy as the old TV show. There are no wild costumes or over-the-top freak characters. Scarecrow's costume consists of nothing more than a burlap sack yet it is more effective than the ridiculous outfits worn by Mr. Freeze or The Riddler in the last two terrible Batman movies.The movie is outright action. The fight scenes are realistic in that there are no stupid one-liners being dropped during the fight, nor does the fight pause for one of the characters to crack a cheap joke. Christian Bale is the best Batman I have ever seen. The supporting cast is incredibly strong; with especially solid performances by Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Liam Neeson and even Gary Oldman (who I have been very critical of in the past). I hadn't seen much of Katie Holmes before this film, but her performance was every bit on par as those of the seasoned veteran actors mentioned above. Lastly there is Cillian Murphy, whose performance reminded me of the chilling characters played in the past by Christopher Walken. I can see Murphy becoming a much bigger name in film in the near future.This was not a children's' movie in any way, though the film is not overly violent or gory. I don't recall seeing any blood at any point in the film. I saw many parents bringing children to the premiere, but I believe these people were expecting a movie like the previous 4 that added corny jokes and enemies that bordered on slapstick with their appearance.The movie distances itself immediately from the others by showing the audience a different version of Bruce Wayne's parents being murdered. The origin is told well and gives us a much better insight on the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman. This Batman is realistic. We see how he is trained and hear what his beliefs are. He even bruises and looks athletic without looking TOO big to hide his appearance when not in costume. I applaud Christopher Nolan for breaking out on his own and not submitting to the campy formula of the other movies.I would gladly see this movie again in the theater. It looks to be the best film of the summer and easily the best film I've seen this year. Because there is no sex or gratuitous violence the film is okay to take the kids to, but don't expect them to be as entertained as they were with the previous films. At no point does this film even pretend to be targeted at a younger audience."
tt0137523,Soooo bad why the raitings is so good ?? The only good thing in the movie is the acting I accepted a good thing !
tt0372784,"4th Viewing and it gets worse each time. I liked it the first time I watched it. The second time too, but the third time it was kinda forgettable and now the 4th time I really see the problems and why I never really remembered what happened.The writing is the culprit of why this isn't very good.First, Katie Holmes is a total bore, she has a personality of a dead fly. Totally lifeless, which isn't good when she is supposed to be Wayne's love interest. Just showing two kids playing for 2 min isn't enough to develop a believable love story. Even as adults, Nolan didn't give us any reason why Wayne would be in love with Rachel. Just having characters exchange looks doesn't cut it. Especially with a dull character like Rachel.Then some of the dialogue was so beyond cheesy I laughed out loud. Alfred was supposed to be on Wayne's side but he constantly seemed to fight against over for the sake of just having drama/conflict. Caine is a great actor, so it's unfortunate his role was such one-dimensional.Freeman was much more interesting.There was no good reason why Wayne was afraid of bats. Them flying out of the well didn't seem like a legit reason why he feared bats so much and had to overcome them. This is like being afraid of dogs but never being bitten by one. To have such deep fear you need to SHOW why and the audience should feel just as afraid. I didn't, and I don't even like bats.Cillian Murphy was definitely one of the best things, but he was totally underused. He was also too easily defeated.In the end, Batman Begins had way too many villains and most of them had too quick of a climax before they were doomed like Carmine Falcone, Joe Chill, and Scarecrow.Nolan just had too many ideas cramped into one film.There is also some inconsistency with how Batman isn't supposed to kill for whatever moral grounds he has, but then he carried a gun and went to kill Joe Chill. That makes no sense.Why does he leave Gotham as an adult for 7 years? Did I miss something?One of the offenses Nolan committed was the total lack of relationship between Wayne and his parents, again, like with the relationship with Rachel, it was tidbit moments without much substance. I literally didn't care when his parents got shot, because I knew NOTHING about them and their relationship with Bruce.If you are going to make a Batman BEGINS, then we need more substance of why he became Batman. Juxtapose this with Star Wars a new hope where we see Luke's day-to-day routines, his interaction with his family, their dinners, work, relationships etc. They could easily have spent 15-20 min on Bruce as a kid and why he loved his parents and why they loved him with ordinary family stuff. Not him pointing and his father giving him a two-sentence life lesson. It's lazy typical writing where they show a kid hugging his parents and then expect people to think that creates a bonding relationship for the audience. They rush to action but forget that action only matters if we care about the people in the action and we can't care about them if we don't know anything substantial about them.I probably won't ever watch this again."
tt0114369,"This movie was just awesome.A thriller that really leaves you on the edge of your seat the whole time your watching. It starts morgan freeman who always does a superb job, accompanied by brad pitt who always did an outstanding job. And to top it all off it was directed by David Fincher who has made some great movies.This movie is about two detectives (Freeman,Pitt) who are sent to invesitage a weird string of murders. There is a murderer killing people using the seven deadly sins as justification.Overall this movie was really good. Great actors, great story line and a lot of twists and turns to keep you interested. I really liked it."
tt0361748,"You know how some things change the scene and set new standards for great, or positively different, movies? This can in my book not be done by repeating and reusing the things you have already created, shame on you Mr Tarantino! Add to that a mix of extremely good, and very bad, actors/directing and you are in for either a very good movie or a very bad.For me the movie started like a 7-8, but after about 1¬Ω hour of jumping back and forth, it went down to a 5 mid movie just to continue the decent to less then a 3.My summery is as follows, staring with the bad ones: - Some big names but no characters to suit them, for instance Brad Pitt which have much more in him then his character gave him credit for. - A lot of bad actors, or badly directed, your choice. - Bad plot. - To darn long! + Some great scenes and some extremely good moments, but thats all that saves this movie from slipping even further down my scale.Do not waste your money going to a cinema, watch this one at home."
tt0167260,"Why? I'll tell you why this is my opinion. First of all I can't believe it's in top five of all times!!! This is unbelievable and I think even the producer is surprised of the position of his movie:) I'm just asking you to think about what major revolutions the movie has brought. First of all the story was already used in a previous movie(The Lord of the Rings 1978). The special effects are great but what about the Matrix? The music and the costumes are great but this is ordinary for a movie with that budget, and the plot is for kids(let's face it) with no passion or feelings etc. just the old war between good and evil witch is present in any Jean-Claude Van-Damme or Stallone movie. I'm very sad, not because the world is insane about the movie, because the movie is in top 5 of all times, so they leaving me no chance but to vote the movie with 1."
tt0167261,"If you haven't seen the first of the trilogy and/or read the book, don't bother going to this movie. Total confusion for three hours; such that, at the end of the film, the uninitiated don't even known what the two towers are/were. The movie is designed for the viewer (i.e., sucker)to run out and rent the first volume because we pick up right where that left off a year ago (which is when I saw it) and the viewer is expected to know exactly where that was, who all these people (and things) are and so on.  Then a bunch of kings and princes with beards show up, and I'm sorry but I just don't have time to tell them apart. Then there's that masochistic goblet or gobbin or some such thing prancing in a loin cloth with bug eyes and incessantly talking to himself. It's just too much, including all the fight scenes which go by so fast you can't figure who shot who. Great New Zealand scenery and excellent special effects might be worth the price of admission. However, this must be breaking sales records with repeat viewers who have an extra three hours (plus 15 minutes of previews) to see it twice in an attempt to figure it out."
tt0172495,"What a piece of cynical garbage from a once good film director.  I found this film appalling on so many levels and it represents where the Hollywood blockbuster is going these days - mindless plots, one dimensional characters, bloated poorly executed special effects.  I really don't know where to begin except if you really liked this movie, please see some more and maybe someday you'll know better.What a waste of talent and my time."
tt0372784,"I actually didn't like the movie that much, I'm actually a fan of Batman returns, because i've always enjoyed Tim Burton's storytelling, and of Batman Forever, which it's just pure undiluted fun. This movie doesn't have any bad acting, nor it's poorly directed, the movie it's really fast-paced and it's reflected in the score which doesn't change for much part of the movie, i think the main problem of the movie is in the writing, the scenes between characters are too short, so you don't have much time to relate to the characters, one moment they're talking to each other, then we move to another scene, then another, then an action scene, then an explanation scene, and although it looks good in paper, the lines just don't work, and they basically connect the movie, since some of them are heard on the beginning of the movie and then heard again at the end, not to mention that the lines are very pretentious and try to make even the most normal situation into a complete psychological and philosophical event (for example almost every scene that involves Rachel and Bruce, and some of Alfred's lines when he's not desperately trying to be funny, he should have leave that to Lucius Fox or the Gotham newspaper which has the funniest scene almost at the end of the movie). I didn't enjoy the bad guys that much, they weren't so threatening, with one amazing exception, played by Tom Wilkinson (Carmine Falcone), who it's just amazing, and even though he's in the movie for about half hour, it's completely memorable. I think the movie was ruined for me because i had really big expectations, and i actually had seen some scenes from the movie before i went to see it, for example the one where Bruce goes to the hotel, almost all the scenes with Lucius Fox showing Bruce Wayne all the hi-tech gadgets, and i thought the movie was gonna expand that, but the scenes were the same, and it's really not that crazy to say that the whole movie can be summed up by the trailer. On the good side of it, i think the batmobile steals the show, but as i said, scenes are very short and quick, so it steals the show for the 15 minutes it appears in it. if you wanna watch the movie don't expect it to be something really, really memorable, the movie it's not confusing, it's pretty clear in it's plot and plot twists, the problem is that it's a Two hour and fifteen minutes long movie that happens to fast, and doesn't stop to entertain us fully, or to connect us to it's characters."
tt0068646,"I honeslty found this movie to be pretty overrated. The cinematagraphy was fantastic and the dialogue was iconic, but that's not all it takes for something to be a good movie.The plot was interesting, but not compelling enough to last 3 hours. The pace was very slow and without subtitles I had so much trouble understanding a word they were saying.The ending was really good and the tension was built up well. But none of the characters felt human enough to care about any of them. If there was just one character who was less corrupt or had an amusing personality, I would have had less of a problem sitting around watching this movie, but it was just boring."
tt0172495,"I came into this movie hearing rave reviews about it, but afterwards, I must say I was rather disappointed. To be fair, the CGI shots of the crowds at The Colluseum were gorgeous, and the fight scenes were top notch. However Gladiator was missing something that other historical epics had, and that was emotion. In Spartacus, we see the horrible conditions that Spartacus and the slaves lived in, and we rooted for them to fight for their freedom. In Braveheart, the film spends a great deal of time developing the romance between Wallace and his wife, and when she's killed by the English, there is a greater emotional response when Wallace fights the English. There was none of that in Gladiator. Although, we see Maximus' wife and son murdered, I felt nothing, since practically no time time was spent fleshing out their relationship. And also Maximus' goal is to overthrow Commodus as emperor and bring control of the Roman Empire to the Senate. I don't know about you, but government restructuring pales in comparison to trying to topple a kingdom. By the time the movie ended, I really didn't care who won or lost. I give Gladiator a 5/10 (5 is for the special effects.)"
tt0133093,"This film gives a lot of emotions, it is difficult to understand, but I think everyone can find their own. Are you ready to fight for your life or sit like a robot at a computer? This is an amazing film."
tt0993846,"8.2 Rating for this tripe? Wow, did the sheep get caught in the echo chamber and herd for this one! They heard, ""Oh Scorcese! Oh Leo DiCaprio! Oh Jonas Hill!"" and they all fell for it! Haha! Suckers! They got sucked into it just like Jordan Belforte sucked all his clients in! That's the only thing funny about this garbage.And please, don't try to pretentiously turn this movie into some kind of moral message, or some kind of hipster perspective on it because there is nothing deep, profound, or any message about it.Looking back on it, this is one of the most insulting films I've ever seen, and not because of the adult content at all, but because it was really a bad movie. The only part I even remember was DiCaprio high on Quaaludes and having a hard time crawling out of his car and up or down the stairs- that was actually funny to see, but that's it. Sure Robbie spreads her legs in the skirt, woopedy doo, nice meme for the vapid millennial generation.Everything else was pure garbage. And another thing: DiCaprio looks nothing like Belforte. Belforte has an alpha male suave about him when this was going on in real life, while DiCaprio is just playing DiCaprio, and I didn't believe for a minute he was capable of being in charge at that corporation. This whole thing is awful.If you want to see a more subtle and intellectual take on the very important topic, then just watch the far superior ""Boiler Room"" with Giovanni Rabese, Vin Diesel, and those guys from around 2000. It is much more intelligently made and still portrays all of the same material, but just with a little more realism and subtlety.It should be in the Bottom 100 worst movies ever made!1.5/10"
tt0172495,"Hard to understand how this uneven flick won the Oscars it did. Russell Crowe has moments, but they are all of a single mood. The sets are tacky (think how gorgeous they are in Fall of the Roman Empire with Loren and Plummer), the cinematography is strangely muddy, and the story leaded.The exception is Joaquim Phoenix's compelling reading of Commodus. The first time Crowe and fellow slave gladiators fight in the arena, Phoenix eclipses the scene with his convincing depiction of blood lust. One could watch the film again just for those few moments of insight into a genuine character."
tt0816692,"Well to me this was one of the better science-fiction movies that I ever saw. It's been a long time since I didn't see a sci-fi like this one. It's extremely long but you won't get bored for a second. And that says enough about it. All the actors gave us a very good performance and some shots were stunning. The story was very well written even though sometimes too complicated to understand but then again who are we to understand anything about the unknown dimensions, black holes or wormholes. You have got to stay concentrated during the whole movie to understand the story but like I said before with Interstellar it is certainly not a problem at all. I was completely absorbed by the story and was actually surprised that time flew by so easily. One of the better movies I watched this year and certainly the best sci-fi in years."
tt0120737,"I liked almost everything about this movie. The actors, the effects, the costumes and the story (of course). But they had added like half an hour to the movie which I found very unnecessary and haughty. Movies are the best when you watch them at the cinema, but i don't want to sit still for three hours if it isn't really necessary. So the fact that they had added 30 unnecessary minutes bothered me a lot. But except that, it's a very good movie."
tt1345836,"Every time a good superhero movie is made ,fanatic fanboys have to rush to IMDb to declare it as the ""Greatest Movie Ever Made"" LOL,, I do give them credit for a least being consistent. With that said, it was a good movie but should not even be in any top 100. Yes, the storyline was far fetched for real life but hey, it's the norm for a sci-fi thriller action movie. Villain wants to destroy stuff,, hero must stop him. It was well acted, and the action, while not ground breaking was shot very well. While Anne Hathaway is great to look at, and done an okay job , I felt you could of totally removed her character from the entire film and it would not have made any difference . It was almost like her role was just filler material. In the end to me it's just a fun summer movie to get lost in,,but not to put on a pedestal..."
tt0361748,"OK, there's a great joke. One joke, but a great one.Some Nazis get killed.Some film gets played.The SS guy has a great time (He's the lead, I don't know why the trailer makes it look like Brad is.) Lots of riffs on classic shots, and possibly lots of in-jokes in the non-subtitled background dialogue.Myers is gold.But to be honest, during the long two and a half hours. Twice I thought ""you could lose a reel here and not miss anything"".Twice.These reels are 20 minutes long.Probably about right."
tt0108052,"The story is about the efforts that Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a World War II profiteer, put out in order to save the Jews from Plaszow concentration camp. Let us make it very clear: from the starting point, Schindler has no interest in saving the Jews. His sole interest, at first, was to make money. How was this man converted from being an opportunistic businessman into a courageous human soul who was willing to save thousands of lives? He even appeared initially unaffected when SS-Lieutenant Amon Goth (Ralph Fiennce) blissfully murdered innocent Jews. How, then, could this man break down at the end of the film because he could not save just one more life is baffling. Agreed that he was surrounded by good Jews, but the probable reason for his transition (encountering a dead Jews who thanked him) was utterly self-congratulatory. Was he even terrified by the murders that were going on (if he was, he never showed it on screen any way)? Perhaps, only the extraordinary Schindler himself could help Spielberg realize it. Or did Spielberg care about strong characterizations, at all? There was no complexity here.However, Liam Neeson's Schindler was given pretty decent treatment when you consider the other elements in Schindler's List. Particularly was, the vicious monster of the story, Lieutenant Amon Goth. Was he the only one who killed (or loved killing) Jews throughout this whole affair? I had this question on my mind when the film exclusively focused on him insanely shooting random Jews from his bedroom. Giving a mad figure the special treatment of being the leading culprit of this mass murder is a laughably simplistic way to make sense of the Holocaust. And it fits into the general audience's banal understanding of the event. The key to Holocaust is the diffusion of responsibility among the persecutors and the lack of moral convictions on the very part of the human race. Those complex concepts were given no treatment in Schindler's List. Instead, everything is reduced to insanity. The very possibility of the Holocaust, therefore, remains alien to a whole audience, who, perhaps, come to see the film just to feel a sense of grandness and liberal guilt. Raplh Fience was terrific in his performance. However, his role, sadly, served as a springboard for the audience to blindly put their blame on. How revealing!In short, the treatment of both Schindler and Goth shed no light on the ambiguity of human nature. Schindler suddenly became ""good"" while Goth was inherently ""bad"" (This only makes the visual comparisons between the two men all the more exploitative). Everything seems pretty common sense, and obviously very digestible. However, if there is a most deplorable injustice being done here, it was the presentation of the Jewish community. Perhaps, everyone who has watched this film can recall the scene of a little girl splashed in red that Schindler spotted during the liquidation of the concentration camp. Anyone could have been fooled by this imagery, whether a film amateur or a veteran film fan. However, if you sit back to think about it, the image is pretty fortuitous. What does this present exactly? Hope? Love? Future? Or even blood? This middle-browned attempt to convey some visual meanings does not succeed in any meaningful way. Worse still, it is an exploitation of the bathos of childhood innocence, which does not make sense in this circumstance. We are dealing with the Jewish community as a whole, not some selective individuals that were singled out from this whole in order for us to dwell on 'sophisticated' feelings of loss and hope. If there is a lesson that is unforgettable about the Holocaust, it is the unjustified prejudice and hatred inflicted upon the Jewish community as a race, not just the brutality and violence that any particular Jew experienced (if you want to know about brutality and trauma, you can ask the 20 million Russians who were dead also). Why not color every Jew red then? Any selective visual presentation in this case is misguiding; and manipulative. Even the sequence that precedes it, a moral struggle between mother, daughter and childhood friend during evacuation does not feel like a climax. It is so trite, so predictable that one might just allow himself to rumble with all the emotions that Spielberg has designed for him. It feels as if, the audience is told what they already know, and all they need to do is sit there, ruminating like an act.The saddest thing is that at the end, when the credit rolls ""In memory of the 6 million Jews who died during the Holocaust"", I wonder what the whole film has to do with those 6 million deaths. If you are inattentive and easy-going, you would freely accept it as an earnest tribute to them. But really? Telling the clich√© story of a thousand who were alive is the tribute to the 6 million who were dead? What does this film have to do with the dead anyway? The desperation, the horror, the pain, the shame and the doubt of those who went dead were not adequately conveyed. Oh, just tell the marvelous story of saving lives to make the audience open their mouths and wonder. And we can forget about those who were dead. What a lovely tribute that Spielberg made!The real story is extraordinary. But there must be a way of telling it without this pretentious sense of self-importance that makes it so easily consumed by an uninformed audience. At no point in this film, do I feel a sense of desperation, that sense of ""needing to get out of this horrible nightmare"". It was just like watching a prodigious show that make you feel ""wowed"" (and admire, and cry?). But remember that grandness cannot replace substance. Indeed, Holocaust is a very difficult subject matter. It needs to be approached first with intelligence. But Spielberg evidently failed to do so."
tt0381429,"Beyond the aesthetically beautiful nature of this movie lies a story that is compelling in its realistic portrayal of young love and loneliness. The story moves along slowly, but I felt that this only added to the credibility of the plot, as most life situations aren't jam-packed with intense drama. The characters are flawed and complex - the main character Heidi is at once naive and youthful, and grown-up and savvy. The story details are slowly inserted, sometimes just through imagery - leaving the viewer to assume much of the back story - the movie does not feel contrived because you aren't being told every small detail and how the director wants you to judge each character. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys artistic camera angles, realistic characters and situations, and doesn't mind slowing down to enjoy a good story."
tt0167260,"I just saw this movie and I must say that I have mixed reactions to it. While there were moments that I was on the edge of my seat, including powerful charge of the Rohirim (as chill inducing as it was is in the books) and the precarious hobbits dangling high above the Morgul Vale, for the most part I was quite annoyed by either the overwrought, drawn out facial expressions of the actors or the unnecessary changes to the plot. Unlike other die hard fans of the book, I did not miss the  Scouring of the Shire scene, which I always felt was unecessary in the books, and certainly didn't need to be on the screen (which would have only added to the multiple endings, all of which, I might add, are in the books). Also, the change with the whole Gollum/Sam framing thing makes Frodo look stupid and Sam a blubbering baby, which the books definitely do not portray. Frodo keeps Gollum with them because he knows that Gollum knows the way better than they do and would never let Sauron get the ring. He shrewdly uses Gollums lust for the ring and desire to keep it for himself as well has his trust in Sam to protect him from Gollum. He also shares Gandalf's wisdom in being able to see Gollums fate woven into the fate of the ring, therefore woven with his as well. On top of this is his honest desire to attempt to reform Gollum and save him from his misery. This is a key point in the book and yet Jackson somehow managed to mangle it into some simplistic Gollum brainwashing trick. And yet I now understand these plot changes, because they start with Jackson saying ""well, we can't have that scene what if this character did this instead?"" and then all of a sudden you need to change some other bit, to make that change make sense, and then you need to change another bit ... etc until pretty soon the character's motivations are complelely different. Note to Jackson: don't mess with a masterpiece, Tolkien had a few thousand more IQ points and a whole lot more time to perfect his story, don't go astray because you think a particular shot would be ""cool"". Once you start unravelling such a intricate ball of yarn, it's hard to knit the thing all back together again (err, something like that, you get the idea).Now having said that, the movie could have been much worse, which is something all the naysayers have to remember, a hollywoodised version of this movie would have been The Matrix or some such drivel. Luckily for Jackson though, he had such solid material to go on, and a litle skill, that it would have taken some serious incompetence to completely botch it. At times in the movie I am reminded that Jackson is a relatively inexperienced director, having directed mostly low budget B-movies (Dead Alive anyone?) and so I would give him an A for effort, but what would have happened if he would have teamed up with a more seasoned director to add some weight to many scenes which obviously lacked it (that final shot of Frodo waking up in the bed was downright painful). Please no more slow motion facial expressions, we get the idea, they're sad/angry/happy, you don't have to ""light it up in neon"" as one critic said. A fine effort, and it will gross billions, but far from the masterpiece people claim it to be."
tt0361748,"I've always been a big fan of Tarantino films, and this was certainly a good addition to his line-up of entertaining films, even though it wasn't his best.The overall plot, in my opinion, wasn't the strongest. It didn't feel like it was well drawn up and instead felt quite disorganised, in particular, I didn't feel as if the Basterds fitted in well with the rest of the plot. Their role in the movie felt rather forced, and the scenes with the Basterds were, in my opinion, the weakest scenes in the movie.Yet, while the plot wasn't really rich, the film made up for it with its tense, memorable scenes and memorable performances. As expected with Tarantino, he builds up the tension with lengthy scenes and long periods of dialogue. Oh, and of course the comedic over-the-top violence that Tarantino is renowned for does occur in this movie don't worry, but at no point was it out of place.But really, what made the film was the acting from Christoph Waltz. Before this film, Waltz was a relatively unknown actor hailing from Vienna, yet afterwards, he was transformed into a mainstream actor who all of the film directors are chasing after, and after watching Inglourious Basterds, you can see why. Waltz played the part of SS Colonel Landa to perfection. Honestly the character is one of the best villains ever in cinema history in my opinion. It was just the sheer competence, elegance and ruthlessness the man possessed made him absolutely compelling. Tarantino himself had fears that the role simply could not be played, yet Waltz completely smashed his fear, with style.As for the rest of the acting, I have to give good mention to Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger, and overall the general acting performances were solid, although, I am critical of Brad Pitt. I felt, especially as one of the main characters, he didn't really create any connection with the viewer, and the role was relatively pedestrian and simple, so this shouldn't be a film that Pitt is renowned for.Overall though, whilst the film wasn't Tarantino's best, it's certainly a film that was very entertaining and kept my interest the whole way through, so it's certainly worth watching, especially to witness the incredible acting from Waltz. I'd give the movie 8.3/10, which is what it currently is rated at."
tt0167260,"This movie needs major editing! At over 3 hours, it's way too long and too slow. There are many parts with no dialog that a viewer can skip without missing any of the story. In addition, there is little explanation of the relationship between the various characters and groups of people, most of whom have nonsensical names. It takes 3 movies and over 9 hours to resolve a relatively straightforward plot -- Frodo has to destroy the ring by throwing it in the fire. It took me at least 3 attempts to watch the entire movie without falling asleep. I finally succeeded to get through the entire movie by watching it in the morning instead of in the evening."
tt0139414,"As if the story line wasn't corny enough, the acting is just as corny. Bridget Fonda should be banned from ever making another movie for her ultra lousy, corny performance in Lake Placid. The only redeeming actors in this movie was Golden Girl's Betty White and Oliver Platt. The Crocodile wasn't very intelligent, but it looked pretty realistic. The movie had a few good scenes, like when the 30 footer snagged a bear and chomped it in half. However, not enough to get the cheese out of the film. 1 * star out of 4 * stars."
tt0137523,"Fight Club is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. In addition to presenting a rather fresh take on life, FC also presents its material in a fresh way. My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about. I will say that I cannot recall *ever* having been ""asked"" by a film to both suspend my disbelief the way this film asks in its third act AND at the same time come to terms with an understanding that there is no room--or need--for disbelief.Perhaps these comments will not make sense to the average movie goer who will dismiss this film--and, unfortunately, its premise--as another hollywood flick filled with gratuitous violence. I'd go as far as to say that this film is not about violence. It is about choices. It is about activity. It is about lethargy. It is about waking up and realizing that at some point in the past we've gone to the toilet and thrown up our dreams without even realizing that society has stuck its fingers down our throat.I would argue that anyone caught, at some point in their lives, between a rock and a hard place--anyone who has reached bottom on a mental level--anyone who has uttered to themselves ""Wait, this isn't right. I would not do/say/feel what it is that I just did/said/felt... I do not like this. I must change before I am forever stuck being the person that I am not."" These people, they will know what I'm talking about. These people will not only recognize the similarities between Edward Norton's character and themselves--they will be uncomfortably familiar with him. These people will appreciate Fight Club for what it is: a wake up call that we are not alone.As David Berman once said: ""I'm afraid I've got more in common with who I was than who I am becoming."" If this sentence makes any sense to you, go see Fight Club. You won't regret it.L."
tt0372784,"This movie tarnishes the Batman legend forever. Even Robin wouldn't like this piece of cinematic guano.Christian Bale is no Batman. His raspy whisper is more hysterical than menacing. How can they let something so patently foolish leave the studio? At the very least they could have dubbed in some more sinister... like Porky Pig. He's easily the weakest of all Batmans. Adam West looks good by comparison.The chemistry is missing between and among the cast. They never seem comfortable with who and/what they are supposed to be. The interaction is stiff; the humor is forced. This could kill a couple of careers... or so one hopes.The story is weak. We all know Batman's origins, the details could have been worked through more expeditiously and knocked a tedious hour or so off of this monstrosity. By the time this film muddled towards climax, I didn't care how it ended---I just wanted that damn thing over. And when it was over, I just wanted my money back. My second disappointment of the day as it turns out. I guess theaters don't do that any more."
tt0167261,"***SPOILERS*** If you think Roger Moore's goofy portrayal of James Bond defines 007, then you might like this version of Tolkien's classic work.  Slapstick and goofy one-liners, etc., abound.  Until seeing this farce, I had no idea that a dwarf has no endurance, an elf can nearly get ridden down by a company of Rohirrim without hearing them coming, and Faramir is just Boromir with a bow!  Wait--cue the crescendo of the theme--Legolas is going to do a goofy ride-the-shield-down-the-stairs trick!  Hey--where's the brave dwarven warrior Gimli, representing the Dwarves--he seems to have been swapped between movies for a clown wearing a banner reading ""Comic Relief""?Why is it that all of the silliest parts of the movie are the ones that are changes from the book?  I have more respect for Tolkien than ever (and far less for Peter Jackson).  I guess Jackson figured that Tolkien fans will see it anyway and decided to Hollywoodize it to gain favor with the Lowest Common (pun intended) Denominator..and I guess it doesn't matter that it makes *him* look stupid to add such gaping holes in the plot."
tt0137523,"This movie based on what world is happening whithin your a single blink. Within a single blink you can do whatever you can in your own imagination.

The only way to break this society is to do whatever we want over the rule we've given. This film got amzing point."
tt0993846,"Martin Scorsese directs the story of a man that reached fortune by becoming really good at doing illegal activities and eventually got in trouble with the law in part for his careless behavior and in part for the bad companion he associated with.One of the few good things of the movie is how it accurately describes the aggressive and intense scene stockbrokers and sellers in general live in, unfortunately that had been done before and done better. Other than that, the movie is just a collection of depraved anecdotes set in slow-mo sequences with cool music (usually ""borrowed"" from other movies) and that makes it a genuine snore fest (literally, there were people snoring in the audience)I really wanted to like it, but it turned out to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, and I've seen the 'English Patient'. I really don't understand why the movie tries so hard to rub in our faces Jordan Belford's excessive and decadent lifestyle, which btw wasn't as shocking as I was expecting.It's funny how critics bash repetitive action and destruction scenes in movies like 'Transformers' or 'Man of Steel', but praise repetitive morbid scenes in movies like this one, when in both cases is a tedious experience.For the first time ever I found myself attending a movie in which I wasn't interested in anything that was going on or cared for any of the characters and when that happens one starts noticing a lot of continuity and edition mistakes that not even direct to DVD movies have, like when a character is supposed to be speaking but even from a behind shot we can see the actor isn't talking at all or the infamous Leonardo Dicaprio ""magic pants"" scene. But the biggest sin of the movie is that it sacrifices the essence over the form, and by that I mean the pace of the story.Once you get over the so called ""controversial"" scenes, you realize the pace is slower than grass growth, because the story didn't need a 3 hour movie to be told. The length of the movie was a consequence of the depraved overkill. Don't believe me? Take agent Denham for instance (the character played by Kyle Chandler) he was introduced 10 minutes into the movie, so we have a pretty good idea of his role in the story and where it's going, however the character speaks his first line 90 minutes after he's introduced (that's right, I was so bored I started timing things like that)Grasp that for a few secs. Ninety minutes! I could have walked out, watched 'Gravity' (again) walked back in and the character wouldn't have yet said anything. And how does the plot unfolds in those 90 minutes? It doesn't, all we see is sex, drugs and partying over and over again. I haven't read the book but I believe Scorsese could've made the movie more engaging if instead of focusing so much on Belford's life would have shown how his actions affected people, I mean we're talking about lifetime savings that were robbed and that resulted in broken families,hundreds (if not thousands) of people losing their homes, their health and even their lives. It could've at least bonded emotionally with the audience.But the fact is, if you've seen the 2 min trailer you already know 90% of the story and even worse, the remaining 10% has also been done before and done better when it was called 'Casino' (btw, the first paragraph of this review was copy / pasted from a review of that movie) which was an exciting story, however when seen in WoWS it seems wasted and clich√©d and of course you may also take into account that even when their performances were good, Jonah Hill is no Joe Pesci, Margot Robbie is no Sharon Stone and unfortunately Leo Dicaprio is no Bobby Deniro.So my recommendation is sneak in, wait until McConaughey's performance is over and then leave.Don't believe the hype4/10"
tt0068646,"In contrast to part 2 this is more loosely structured and sometimes less climactic and also seems more improvised. But thanks to the enormous effort put to detailed cinematography and camera-work it lends itself more to repeated viewings. (One example: when Vito is about to be shot there's a poster on the grocery store announcing a fight of Jake LaMotta thus foreshadowing the assassination attempt).Probably the most interesting is the light and dark contrast between the outer, ordinary world and the inner, godfather world. Even when these two worlds meet in one shot they are still strictly separated by showing two rooms in a way where you watch one world from the other (the end shot e.g. where Kay is seen in one room and the men in another: then the door shuts).Very effective use of mirrors (reflection), doors (separating worlds) and windows (showing perspective). From the back-to-back shots and other shots where an object obscures the picture we can see where many modern filmmakers get their ideas (Kar-Wai for example).Coppola has himself watched Antonioni very well: Scenes where only buildings or spaces are shown to create an alienating effect or just loneliness combined with tension (hospital scene). Or characters disappear and only a static shot of the room is seen to signify emptiness (fight between Connie and Carlo).Especially the end scene is well edited and composed: But they even improved on that scene just two years later."
tt0361748,"I am normally the first to slam revisionist history and did not go to see this on cinema release.It came onto television recently and having nothing better to do, and there being not much else on, gave it a whirl. Well blow me down,I really enjoyed it, and had to go away and think why I did so, when the plot is overall quite preposterous. And I think that is the key to the movie, it is sheer over the top nonsense so that it actually transcends revisionist history and becomes a piece of entertainment.There is some stuff in there though that isn't much known that is real history. Both Goebbels and Hitler were huge movie fans and indeed Goebbels produced a version of Titanic that is quite extraordinary in its propaganda but is regarded as the first effort to seriously make a movie about the tragedy (Google Nazi Titanic). It can be bought and I have a copy but it can now be downloaded from You Tube. Goebbels production makes his one just as ridiculous as I.B. which adds to the irony.I found it hard not to watch this movie without a grin on my face because it is very well acted (actually overacted) and so clich√©d (deliberately) that it does not really take itself seriously, and you can see that. Brad Pitt is having a ball. But it was the performance of Cristoph Waltz that really blew me away. How good was he? The perfect blend of Nazi evil with a touch of vaudeville thrown in.Recommended.This movie is completely over the top which is why it works. It does not want to try and rewrite history like the goddam awful Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Killer which takes itself all to seriously."
tt0114369,"This movie is regarded as the definition of a modern thriller. It is easy to see why, as it is easily one of the most suspenseful movies I have ever seen. What added to this suspense, was the straightforward, yet grim storyline, that keeps the audience interested.The plot revolves around two detectives, William Somerset, and David Mills, trying to solve the mystery of a serial killer. That killer, John Doe, leaves clues around for unknown reasons. Detective Somerset believes he (the killer) is following the seven deadly sins (hence the title Seven, or Se7en, and is leading them to something. What this is, is unclear, but they do eventually capture him, and he reveals that his final victim, is David's wife Tracy, thus showing he was playing a game with them all along.There are few movies I have seen, before or since, that are suspenseful as this. It is also quite bleak, which did admittedly put me off at times. It is still a great film, definitely worth a watch, if you are old enough (remembering this movie is rated R), and whether or not you enjoy it, you will probably find it interesting. From me it gets 8/10"
tt0120815,"This movie will rank in the top 100 movies of all time for years and years to come. Why? Because it helps shows war with real decency. No one would want to watch a movie with only killing, blood and gore. No one really does. This movie manages to let us, the viewers, watch virtually a firsthand take of what veterans went through.The acting was phenomenal. Tom Hanks was at his best yet, with superb realism which he displayed. Good job to others: Tom Sizemore, Edward Burn, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, and of course Vin Diessel.The Director: Steven Spielberg directed the best movie he ever made. This movie was unbelievably realistic. I know that throughout this movie, I did not and could not possibly think about anything that might take me away from the movie. In fact, the whole time I imagined that this was not a movie, that it really occurred.The music director: John Williams made one of the best of Alltime. The beautiful piece: Hymn to the Fallen Soldiers raises the goosebumps from your arms. Extremely good job with that. Revisiting Normandy and others also were profoundly beautiful. The sound was amazing. The sound of the tanks rolling, warfare, bullets under water, etc. really super sized this movie. The sound tanks in this movie got me scared.This movie clearly should have won best movie, and best actor.I loved it and watch it once every month, which I simply can not elude."
tt1853728,"I thought this production was an all around great motion picture. It kept you on your toes, it made you laugh, It made you think. Most importantly, it gives you a different perspective on the times from slavery with a comedic twist."
tt0102926,"I really wanted to leave the theater several time during the premiere of this cornball turkey, but I stayed till the bitter end. I was not scared; I was not repulsed; I was annoyed. Grand guignol histrionics, laughable dialogue (""fava beans"" indeed), impossible plot holes, and as mismatched a pair of leads as one could imagine, made this a tedious experience. And the idiocy of a main character whose parents named him Hannibal and he just happens to grow up to become a cannibal. Really? Sounds like an idea Chester Gould would have discarded as corny and unbelievable.While Jodie Foster displays no personality at all, Anthony Hopkins gives an outrageously hammy performance that would make Donald Pleasence wince. In fact, Hannibal Lector eats so much scenery in this film, how could he possibly have any room left for people?The reaction to this dog after I saw it was truly amazing - and very depressing. As far as I am concerned, the Oscars‚Ñ¢ have always been beneath contempt, so when this celluloid Necco wafer won several gilded statuettes, I was not surprised. But I am still depressed that it is considered by many to be a classic. Feh!"
tt0993846,"If you don't like what you see within the first 15 minutes of this film, turn it off or leave the theater, because that's what you will see repeated over and over again for the next three hours. Okay, I get it. There are people who will do anything for money and who are morally bankrupt. This is Hollywood meets soft porn when soft porn has already been killed off by one-click-accessible porn. I'm not a puritan. This is just an objective fact. We live in the Age of Pornography. I, therefore, don't understand why Scorsese thinks this is the 'shocking' lens he should use to educate us on the evils of Wall Street greed and excess, unless he hopes to drag in the teenage boy audience, in which case, it simply amounts to pandering. In the end, I felt that it was Scorsese himself who was morally bankrupt. I think it is time for him to reassess his career. No great film was ever made so by pandering to base instincts. Great films stand on the strength of fundamental truths about human nature that leave the viewer leaving the theater uplifted, inspired, or awakened to elements of human nature in some way. This does not mean all movies have to have happy endings. The knowledge one takes from a good film can force one to reassess their values or ideas and this can be a difficult experience. But there is nothing fundamentally challenging about this film. Even if you try to think of it as a sort of documentary, it falls flat.Now, what about the acting? There is no doubt that Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor. However, I haven't been impressed by many of his recent efforts (i.e. Gatsby). In this film his character is one dimensional from beginning to end. There is no character development and no real opportunities for him to show his acting range. The same can be said for all the other actors, but given such an insipid script, what can you expect? After a couple of hours of watching Scorsese trying to educate us on the evils of wealth, I just wanted the film to end. He seemed to have an ax to grind in the tradition of other ax-grinders like Michael Moore and Oliver Stone. The last hour was simply an ordeal. Scenes seemed randomly cut and pasted together. Although I can't say there were not some interesting scenes within the film, they only served as sad reminders of Scorsese's wasted talent.It makes no sense at all to me why this film is rated so highly. Maybe there are a number of people who were surprised to learn that excessive wealth can lead to bad behavior. All I learned is to be careful of giving too much credence to the ratings of any Scorsese film."
tt0167260,"First of all: I liked this movie, and i could watch it an awful lot of times. But that is mostly due to the great special effects .The point i rated this movie a 7 is because of the stupid story mistakes Peter putted in his movie. Especially the ghost army is a huge, huge mistake. Everybody who readed the book knows the ghost army does not take part in the huge fight, but only conquers the pirate's fleet, so Aragorn and his men can sail to the battle. The orcs think they get some backup when they see the black sails, but then are overrun by Aragorn, not the ghosts.Like the thing above there are more things which i do not like. Like the snowboarding Legolas in the battle for Helm's Deep (not this movie, but still). Legolas is indeed quite handy on his feet, but snowboarding on a shield?These are just the things which made me personally think Peter could have come up with a much better movie of one of the best story's ever written."
tt0068646,"I was finally forced to watch this 'masterpiece'.  What, exactly, is the redeeming feature of this movie that all these film 'elites' love so much.It was a long, boring, tedious experience I would never want to repeat. Watching old men convince young men to kill other old men was pointless. Was there an actual point to the story?  Or was it crafted just to sell the next installment.This movie has no business being so well-liked and shows what is wrong with both American cimema and the IMDB ranking system."
tt0068646,"Even quite tense at times - that restaurant scene had my heart pounding, as did the hospital scene. But it is overhyped. Okay, scene composition and direction are top notch, yadda yadda, acting is phenomenal, but you can't watch it without thinking ""everyone says this is the greatest film of all time"". Well maybe it is for some, but the film suffers from high expectations as a consequence. Not that you, gentle reader, are interested, but I didn't rate it as highly as Apocalypse Now, Seven Samurai or even Star Wars, but it deserves a respectable 8/10 and if you haven't seen it, its worth 3 hours of your time.Just don't believe the hype."
tt0120815,"I didn't like this one. People seem to fall for Spielberg's direction, which is very good with the exception of some big mistakes (see below). But the story is so bad.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!First of all: how can the old man at the beach remember things, he never saw? I mean he did not participate in the landing, how on earth he can remember it so vividly?Second: Question: In the end: the bridge is set with explosives, a tank is hit by a bomb from a fighter plane and a man is on that bridge directly in front of the tank. What happens to him? According to Spielberg / Rodat: Nothing! The tank is destroyed, the bridge is not, and there is not shrapnel at all - and the man is still in one piece!! Come on, you people, you call THIS realistic?!Third: Monty-bashing is okay IMO (see MarketGarden), but how come that Hanks, who is just a Captain, is more aware of the general situation than higher ranking officers with all the information they are getting from other troops, planes etc.? I am referring to the scene on the beach, when Hanks is telling us about the importance of this particulare bridge. Which turns out to be very small, nothing pioneers could not build over night. It's not like crossing the Rhine! But Hanks claims, that this bridge is not only vital for the success of D-Day, but the entire war!! This is crap beyond imagination! Thank you Mr. Rodat, you made us all believe that every soldier in every thick of a fight can judge better than a General!Four: The change of Hanks. He is trying to come out alive, he even tries to save his men's lifes. Wandering around in France he happens to hit a lonely German outpost with a machine gun. Question: What is the right decision? Correct! You run directly into the line of fire... Well, he could have said: ""Men, do you want to walk around it, could be, say, a mile to avoid it...?!"" Soldier: ""No, my script says, I have to die here, so let's run into it!"" Hanks: ""Ah, you are right! And there will be also a German soldier who has to beg for his life, and I have to have mercy on him, so he will be able to run and fight us again later. Hmm, that shows pretty well the evilness of the Germans. Okay, so let's run!""Five: The change of Hanks. So he has lost a man. Now he's going for it: ""Let's call this bridge !The Alamo!. This is were we will fall back to."" Soldier: ""Hmm, I don't remember exactly: What happened to the defenders of that place in Mexico, uh, Texas...?"" Hanks: ""Uh, any OTHER questions...?""Six: The final battle. Well though the SS was being an elite troop at the beginning of the war, it was watered down by 1944. But they were fanatics and/or thugs/killers/low-lifes/scum - you get the idea! - from about 16 countries at this time. There were even French, Norwegian, Swedish, Ukrainian soldiers - you name it - in the German army at this time. All in all we can consider them to be very dangerous. Maybe this particulare troop had some veterans from the eastern front. This is an armored infantry, bringing along tanks. And now enter Hanks an Co. They decide to shoot it out and - guess by yourself what happens....Seven: The characters. Don't get me started on that...Dear Mr. Spielberg, you are great, but you have to have more patience looking for good scripts. You did cinema history with the opening sequence, but the rest just sucks - due to the script.Dear Mr. Rodat, maybe the original script was better than this mess, maybe I am doing you wrong. But on the other hand, your next script was ""The patriot"". The one with Gibson, not Seagal...well, you'll keep trying, huh?!The movie was in the Top 10 (if I remember right), and now it's down on 58. But the users of IMDb comment on it enthusiastically. I guess the the ones who did not like it, did not comment?Bad, bad writing, good directing, good Hanks 4/10 Macaulay J. Connor"
tt0816692,"My wife and I love Sci-fi and have been anticipating this movie for months! When we saw the 9.3 review (that's what it is now anyway) we were even more excited. So, off we went to the theater last night ready to be blown away.We almost left the movie, which would be a first.OK, the special effects are great, but the sniveling factor we couldn't stomach. I'm mean seriously, there was someone bawling on the screen nearly 50% of the movie. Many of the lines were so cheesy we look at each other like, ""can you believe this?"" If you like sad drama's, depressing story lines and crying astronauts give it a go. This falls under SciFi, but it really should fall under drama. Ugh, I'm trying to forget it."

tt0110912,"For me, Pulp Fiction is a good movie. It's just not as good as so many say it is. When I took film classes in college, everyone wanted to be the next Quinton Tarantino. I actually thought Pulp Fiction had some brilliant scenes, but also some rather dull and boring scenes that were a struggle to get through. I've seen the movie now four or five times over the last twenty years to see if my opinion changes. It doesn't. In my opinion, it's a very overrated movie. It doesn't mean it's not a good movie. It's a must for any film buff, but the hype is a little over done."
tt0109830,"There aren't many movies that have penetrated the subconscious of the American zeitgeist as intensely as Gump, and it's not hard to see why. It's a film that deftly mixes nearly every genre into one epic tale, yet never shies away from the importance of small moments. But with this much love, cynicism and (some deserved) scorn aren't far behind: terms like ""on-the nose"" and ""syrupy sweet"" come to mind. But what's the advantage of this cynicism when it's so rewarding to just sit back and enjoy? At its core, Gump is pure Hollywood magic that deserves to be treasured. Essentially a biopic of a fictional character, Gump is first-person-perspective storytelling with a protagonist who sees much but perceives little¬Öat least not in the same way we do. Swimming in historical fiction and even magical realism, he impacts American history: presidents are met, classic songs are heard, Vietnam wars are fought¬Öyet Forrest's gaze is set on one thing: love. It's silly and whimsical, yet consistently surprising to see Forrest navigate through life with such sincerity and tenacity. Lest we neglect how technically impeccable the film is. The aesthetic is simplistic and gorgeous, and the effects (missing limbs, altered historical footage) are light years ahead of what they should be. But these things are rarely mentioned because they aren't the point. Zemeckis wants the movie to be the same as its hero: simple, random, sincere. Gump's unconditional love, overwhelming kindness, and na√Øve determination got him wherever he needed to be, and that journey leaves him and us in stitches, while never abandoning hope. Manipulative? Maybe¬Öor maybe it's just great filmmaking."
tt0110912,"Color me stupid but I thought ""Pulp Fiction"" sucked. Being creative is easy when there are no rules...as in fantasies and cartoons and, well, pulp fiction. Creativity is not easy when the rules of reality are imposed. The reason why it took me several sessions over several  years to finally assimilate this boring piece of filmdom crap is simply because its silly story and peculiar characters are one dimensional sensationalistic nonsense which almost anyone could have created and I personally found them boring...not unlike Sunday morning cartoons. Of course that criticism flies in a face of incredible popularity by the public and critics alike not to mention an Oscar and countless other awards. Go figure. Bottom line, ""Pulp..."" -is- pulp fiction brought to the big screen with all the gratuitous filth and violence of a dime novel but without the one thing which could really have made it interesting. Why no T&A???"
tt0480025,"The skinhead culture fascinates many directors and it's understandable. It's one of the few remaining subcultures in the West, much because of the Nazi connections.But the skins in this movie aren't political and no racists to start with. One of the gang members is even black. They live in a happy community in the early 80s, having fun and being together in a totally grey unfriendly working class environment. It's very hopeful and the 12-year-old finds himself accepted for the first time in his life. His longing for the dead father of the Falklands war is somewhat replaced.But darkness arrives with the skin veteran who comes back from jail. And there are conflicts between the racist fraction and the others. But whatever this is, it's not black and white. The characters are much more complicated.Much has been said about young Thomas Turgoose as the 12-year-old. He's very good but the great portrait is by Stephen Graham as the old/new gang leader. Absolutely brilliant work."
tt0102926,The book is completely boring. The movie is more interesting. Jodie Foster is the worst actress I ever seen. Obviously she never had any lessons. She can't act and more worse she doesn't open her mouth while she speaks - a disaster without compare. People like Jodie Foster would fail ANY real test for actors. But in Hollywood even the worst actors can earn millions of dollars with technically extreme bad acting. A real joke to pair the technically worst speaking actress with one of the technically best speaking actors (Anthony Hopkins) in a movie where the book is even more boring than the movie. The plot is just like the book illogical IN ANY SENSE.
tt0102926,"The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite of all time. It is a masterpiece of suspense, horror and psychological drama. The performances of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are unforgettable, as they play a rookie FBI agent and a brilliant but twisted serial killer who form an unlikely alliance to catch another murderer. The film is full of memorable scenes, such as the first encounter between Clarice and Hannibal, the night vision chase in the basement, and the chilling finale. The Silence of the Lambs is a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, makes you think, and stays with you long after it ends. It is a classic that deserves all the praise and awards it has received. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves cinema.üé¨"
tt0114369,"""Se7en"" is one of these cinematic rarities that elevate themselves to unsuspected levels of depth after each viewing, in the greatest tradition of film noir and detective mysteries. Like ""Chinatown"", it reinvented the noir genre with its own particular atmosphere, both were and are still atypical for their time, and both end with a case solved, yet a puzzling conclusion.""Se7en"" is less about the series of crimes committed than the two men who lead the investigation, and the way their relationship evolves and highlights their respective approach to life, to death, to the world they live in, with an implicitness that respects our intelligence enough so we can respect the film in return. This intelligence (or subtlety) is not immediately palpable, and the opening scene can mislead some viewers by falsely establishing the sort of odd couple we'd expect in a cop team: the wise veteran and the hot-headed youngster. Of course, you can trust David Fincher's directing and the cleverness of the script because there's much more to say about Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in these two roles, among the best of their careers.Morgan Freeman is Sommerset, a cop in his last week before retirement but not THE typical cop about to retire, (as a matter of fact, nothing is typical in ""Se7en""), he's a law enforcer who never fired in 34 years of service and never got shot either, quite an achievement for someone who doesn't work in the most secure neighborhood. Sommerset incarnates the typical noir protagonist, whose optimism was eroded by years and years of facing and fighting the most sordid crimes. Although he's not the most likely to have faith in humanity, he's not cynical because he still respects his job. However, he's lucid about one thing, as long as there will be men, there will be rapists, killers, and criminals of the worst species. Sommerset is lucid and competent, he's like a spotlight of hope in a gloomy darkness, and that's enough to gain our respect, he's calm even when facing the most horrific and gruesome crimes, like the poor obese man forced to eat to death.This opening crime is spectacular and graphic, but Fincher restrains himself because the horror is sometimes more efficient when it's suggested. The horrific aspect of the first crime is also distracted by the first interactions with Mills, Brad Pitt, as the replacing Detective. Mills is not a rookie, he's got his share of thrills and he knows his business. The problem is his temper: too cocky, too hot-headed, too sure of himself, he can't stand Sommerset's patronizing attitude. The progress of the investigation depends on the partnership between Mills and Sommerset, so they do their best to accommodate each other but it's only when Sommerset is invited to dinner by Mills' wife Tracy, that the ice is broken. Tracy here is essential, and not just as a simple plot device, she's a sweet and caring housewife, beautifully played by Gwyneth Paltrow. Tracy loves her husband and provides the extra level of depth needed to appreciate Mills' character who's more one-dimensional in contrast with Sommerset.Tracy is the emotional connection between the viewers and Mills, and consequently between Mills and Sommerset, she's the heart of the film, and plays like an efficient counterpart to the gloomy atmosphere we're plunged in since the very start, it's no wonder that she 'hates the place', she embodies hope, family, marriage, loyalty, the best in humanity. And that's the most brilliant aspect of ""Se7en"", especially from a 29-year old director: David Fincher, with a remarkable craftsmanship, establishes all the elements of the puzzle in the first half-hour, setting the atmosphere: a rainy, dark and totally unappealing little town. It's a hellish, nightmarish world where we're plunged, where only feeble spotlights can penetrate a nightmarish darkness, it's one of these places, you're afraid to walk like in a dark room where you can accidentally put your foot on a sleeping cockroach. Talk about a hostile atmosphere.But this atmosphere is perfect because it fits the nature of the crimes committed, and creates the disturbing urge to establish a peaceful relationship between Mills and Sommerset, which coincides with the discovery of the first two murder's links: a fat man is killed by eating, a successful lawyer forced to trade parts of his body to (temporarily) spare his live, two words written in various parts: Gluttony, Greed ¬Ö an obvious 'to be continued' message to the cops. So, everything leads to the conclusion that the crimes are related to the seven deadly sins, and this time, it's not a killer who kills, but, as states Sommerset: a killer who preaches. But Mills calls a spade a spade, and by labeling the unknown man as 'demented' and 'crazy', he lamentably clouds his judgment while Sommerset is more rational and tries to think like the killer. Mills is all about emotional reactions, Sommerset thinks before he acts, impulses and reason, interestingly, it's the former who believes in love and family, as if 'passion' could work like a double-edged sword.The atypical nature of the crimes and their author elevate the film, Sommerset goes to library to try to find out hints in Saint-Augustin's books, Dante's Inferno and other medieval and metaphysical classics. Though ""Se7en"" doesn't necessarily go deeper in the subject but it touched them enough to carry a sort of pedagogical value. We might not read all these books after, but I'm sure many of us, would question their approach to some crucial religious notions like faith, forgiveness, innocence and passion. On that level, the film is not just a cat-and-mouse thriller; it's also a descent into the most hellish aspects of humanity, incarnated by the villain's face, what's more with a perfect conclusion, leaving us with a truly awkward and uncomfortable sensation, free enough to see the half-full or half-empty glass.Again, ""Se7en"" is a film that respects the viewer's intelligence."
tt0816692,"Hi all! The film combines Science and Fiction. To be honest, they stuffed too much of everything. At the end of the film, I realized that I did not understand anything at all. My friends for this reason decided to revise it. And I think that the film in which nothing is clear is worthy of 3 stars. Thanks to all."

tt0120815,"Like so many of his generation, Steven Spielberg's father served in World War II. Therefore, the director had spent countless hours listening to Daddy describing his war-time experiences. Many years later, when Spielberg received a script about the battles on Omaha Beach in 1944, he therefore became enthusiastic. Making a film about the fight against the Nazis seemed a good way to pay tribute to Dad.The movie takes place on D-day, during the Allied invasion of Normandy towards the end of the war. It follows eight young American soldiers, struggling to find a certain Private Ryan behind enemy lines. And bring him back to the United States. Alive!Steven Spielberg hired a retired marine captain to prepare the actors for the grueling shoot. His ""boot camp"" lasted six days, with extremely tough military exercises. There was intensive weapons training, close combat drills and endless, individual maneuvers. The only thing the guys got to eat were K-rations of the same type that was used on the battlefields during the Second World War.Despite all the controversy regarding the amount of brutality portrayed, the film became a worldwide hit. It ultimately grossed over $500 million at the global box office. The movie also inspired a lively media debate about the increasing violence in popular culture. After winning a number of prestigious international awards, ""Saving Private Ryan"" collected eleven Academy Award nominations.Surprisingly, ""Saving Private Ryan"" lost to ""Shakespeare in Love"" for the best picture Oscar. Something that was considered one of the great controversies in the history of the Academy Awards. However, Steven Spielberg didn't go home empty-handed. For the second time in a few years, he won a best director Oscar. And, as in the case of ""Schindler's List"", it was for a film set during World War ll."
tt0172495,"As stated on the One line Summary, this comment will be short, so without further ado here it goes:  Hasn¬¥t anyone noticed the uncanny resemblance of Gladiator (2000) with the 1964 Classic ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" directed by Anthony Mann and starring (only to name a few) Sophia Loren, Stephen Boyd, Christopher Plummer, Alec Guiness, etc..?  As I watched the movie on the screen the other day, I could not help but make comparisons all the way.  The only thing is that the General¬¥s name was changed from Livius to Maximus, and the ensuing love affair between him and the Emperor¬¥s daughter Lucilla.  Which, in this version, is not fully developed because they never explain in depth, or at least, enough to know for certain, but you can only speculate on many levels.  Anyhow, just wanted to give my 2 cents, for whatever they are worth.  Hope I did not spoil it for anyone. Sorry guys!!!"
tt0109830,"A great movie, its great story and the story of Lieutenant Dan was sad, but I think it does not deserve the Academy Award for Best Film. I really enjoyed watching the movie and hated the character of Jenny."
tt0108052,"The problem with 'Schindler's List' is that, although superbly made by one of the most talented directors who ever lived, it has an agenda: to convince people of the Holocaust. I mean, why add all those dramatic scenes of children being led to their deaths, the gassings, bodies burning etc? What did all that add to the film story apart from try to shock the viewers? Schindler himself was, in reality, far removed from the nice man portrayed by Liam Neeson. Most of what he did was not because he particularly cared about the Jews, but because they made him lots of money. He was also a serial womaniser and adulterer. Basically, the film is a sentimental Hollywood melodrama which happens to be set at a time of great cruelty, motivated by blind fanaticism. An opportunity was lost to analyse WHY the Nazis hated Jews so much, what were the fundamental roots of the German-Jewish conflict? Instead Spielberg went for the safe option of creating brutal German robots and innocent, perplexed Jewish victims. And the final scene when Schindler gave his speech was frankly ridiculous. Final verdict: magnificent film, subject matter not properly presented."
tt0361748,"The movie is pointless. My opinion is that... actually Im not even sure if I can come up with at least 10 lines that IMDb requires me to produce. so I will try to come up with something to justify my 15 dollar movie ticket. I know that you cannot expect historical accuracy from the entertainment industry but this movie just makes no sense to me. There are no action packed sequences. No historical accuracy. some violence? If you liked the movie for its violence, then ...well then this movie is in your category. You must've liked the Hostel and Hostel2 too.:)I noticed most critics in major News outlets gave it 5 stars and seems most people bought it. I just didn't get it, I guess thats why I'm not a critic:)One good thing about the movie is its linguistic scope. Not uncommon for Tarantino. Very good set of actors. Christofer Waltz will finally be recognized after 20 years of acting in Europe..!;)"
tt1130884,"I have seen this movie several times. This movie gave me the feeling of excitement, fear, anxiety, sadness, happiness. I liked the sense of mystery of the movie and that the first time I saw the movie, I made the wrong judgment about the events. The music of the movie. It was a masterpiece. If you like the mystery genre, this movie is one of the best choices. The movie goes so well that you don't realize it's over. It was the first movie I watched twice in one day.There is only one small problem.Part of the film, one of the dead people blinks.It is strange to me how there is such a problem in such a movie!Of course, I did not understand the first time I saw the film.Those who have read the book believe that important details have been omitted from the book.I think it's intentional to make the movie more complicated."
tt0167260,"Before I review this good movie, I have to get something that's been bothering me off my chest.I went with eight people to see ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King."" All eight of them found it ""good"" at best. We all thought it was too long, with too many passages of dialogue explaining what was going to happen (""I ride to Minis Tirith at dawn to face the enemies of Middle-Earth!"" -- just do it already!), too many scenes that most definitely could have been cut or edited, and we all found that the ending of the film stretched on too long and we didn't need to see Frodo and Sam fondly gazing at each other ninety times before we got the idea that they have an affection for each other. (Brotherly love or...something else?)The thing is, all the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies are good. But none of them are great. Filmed by Peter Jackson with an epic feeling that betrays J.R.R. Tolkien's light-hearted tale, the films try to take a somewhat light idea and turn them into epics -- a problem, since the entire world is fantasy, and it is hard to take anything in the film dreadfully serious. (I thought it was just I, but some other critics have noted the same problem.)This is the best ""Lord of the Rings"" movie. Even though it sounds as if I am complaining about them, I am not. I'm complaining about the way movie geeks flock to the cinemas and spread word that it's the ""best film of all time,"" then post these comments on the Internet and try to boost the film's rating on IMDb. (Some fans have been caught in the act of making multiple usernames to do so.)I find it almost laughable that anyone could argue that the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is the best of all time, or that it is the better than ""The Godfather"" (because that film stands as the number one film on the Internet Movie Database, there are heated debates from ""Rings"" fans claiming that ""The Godfather"" is trash and their favorite film is not).It's all opinion, of course, but I sometimes wonder whether the fans of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" those who claim they are superior to ""The Godfather,"" have even seen that film. I also wonder whether the strict fans that claim it is the best film ever made have actually seen enough films to qualify for that assumption -- if it is their favorite film, fine, but to say it is THE best film of all time is entirely their opinion, although they seem to take it as a fact.  Have they seen the films of Fellini? Kurosawa? Scorsese? Coppola? ""Citizen Kane""? ""Casablanca""? ""Taxi Driver""? ""Sweet Smell of Success""? ""To Kill a Mockingbird""? ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""? ""Chinatown""? ""Apocalypse Now""? ""2001: A Space Odyssey""? The list goes on!Their definitions of classics range from the time of ""Star Wars"" to present cinema. It may sound like an old argument but it's true -- greater films are harder to find nowadays, and just because ""The Lord of the Rings"" seems like an achievement of some sort, it does not make it the best film of all time. I can name many better films. But, then again, it's my opinion, I suppose.Now that I'm done with my rant, there's nothing left to say. Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) venture closer to Mordor to destroy The One Ring, while Gollum (Andy Serkis) plots to murder them both and take the Ring of Power for himself. (We get to see Gollum's background in the film, too, which is something that will satisfy Tolkien's fans that have read the stories.)Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) returns to the throne of a kingdom (hence the title of the film) to claim his position as heir of Isildur, but first gathers together Legolas and Gimli (Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies) to help battle the Orcs venturing closer to their castle, along with Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen), who opens a can of whoop [butt] in this movie.This is the darkest film of the trilogy. You may have thought ""The Two Towers"" was dark, but ""The Return of the King"" is almost evil -- Frodo gives audiences the creeps a few times. When he says, ""The Ring is mine,"" and grins at Sam with the Elijah Wood grin, a shiver goes down your spine.The film picks up pace starting with the giant arachnid battle, about halfway through the film, and continues down the path of mild greatness until the last twenty minutes, which never seem to end. It is as if Jackson was afraid to close his film for a final time and kept dragging the scenes out -- I don't need to see Frodo and Sam admiring each other more than twice!As the credits rolled, the audience poured out of the theater. ""Wasn't that good?"" I heard someone say. ""No,"" was the reply. ""The Return of the King"" is a very good film, and certainly the best of the trilogy, but don't be fooled by the hype -- this is not one of the best films of all time. It's a case of the Emperor's New Clothes -- some day, someone's going to realize that what they're going on about isn't really there at all. And finally all the film fans will be able to say, ""Y'know, I never really loved the movie all that much anyway."" But for now, I guess we'll all have to put up with more unearned hype.I liked this movie. I liked it a lot at certain points. But I would never, ever call it great. That's just me, I guess.4.5/5 stars.John Ulmer"
tt0114369,"I don't really understand the hype over this movie, it has a good cast and it is a good movie but it's different to be good and to be one of the greatest and this movie has nothing that makes it one of the greatest. The only interesting thing here is that the killer uses the seven deadly sins but even this premise could've been better used, the plot twist is kinda shocking but isn't one of the best ones, ain't one of those jaw dropping ones, at least not for me. The actors did normal nothing especial here too. I love movies of this kind but I got bored watching this and is really nothing special about it, just a massive disappointment"
tt0109830,"I know I'm not the only one who hated this movie. In fact I'm not even the only person in my family that hated this movie, my mom and sister did too, and I have met other people who hated this movie throughout the years since it came out. Unfortunately, it hasn't been too many people at all.Enough of that, I of course looked and heard why people seem to like this movie so much. But I couldn't disagree more. The whole plot of the movie is ridiculous -- how a mentally challenged person could go through or cause all these historical events and fads. For example, creating the smiley face, the s*** happens bumper sticker, catching the people in the Watergate scandal, winning a medal of honor, becoming a ping-pong champion (like an American can ever win that!), becoming an all-American athlete for football, running across the country, falling in love with a drug-addicted stripper (well i guess this one's believable as he is mentally challenged), speaking out against the Vietnam war after he won the medal of honor for it, etc. STUPID, STUPID, STUPID. Running some more, STUPID, STUPID, STUPID. Then just quitting for no apparent reason, STUPID, STUPID, STUPID!!!!OK, now the good parts of it. Yes there are some things I liked about the movie. The cinematography was beautiful (and I'm a big fan of this as I believe it helps set the tone of a movie), but it's useless because there is nothing for it to enhance. I also liked Gary Sinise in this; Lt. Dan is actually a cool character. And of course, the soundtrack is awesome...Now only if we can mute everyone but Gary Sinise and the music, I might be able to sit through this movie again. One can only hope...Now back to the not so good to outright horrible. I never read the book by Winston Groom so I can't say if they did the book justice or not, and I really don't care. I mentioned how much I hated the basic premise for this movie, but the dialog doesn't help either, with it's cheesy axioms and pathetic southern accents (I used to live in TN, and I don't remember the accents being that bad). Whatever, I can live with the accents, but I prefer the exaggerated ones in ""Fargo"" (I thought they sounded cool). Anyway, now onto the acting: Tom Hanks wasn't great in this movie at all. How hard is it to play somebody that doesn't change from one scene to the next. He walks, talks, and acts the same in every scene of the movie. This had to have been Hanks' easiest performance to play...and it won him his second Oscar. But of course this isn't the first time that's happened. See Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man,"" but at least that was a good movie.I like a lot of Robert Zemeckis's films by the way to include ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" ""Contact"" and even ""Beowulf,"" but this one, he asked way too much for me to believe. I actually think the events of ""Star Wars 1-6"" were more likely to have occurred than the events in this movie. A lot has been said about his right wing political agenda; I don't care; it's his movie, he can do what he wants with, but I don't have to agree. Also that this movie is stereotypical to blacks. I always wondered what African Americans thought about some of the stuff in it as I don't think it was meant to be racist, but some of it kind of came off like it. I guess it's up to them to decide.Now onto the last part of my comment which doesn't have anything to do with why I like/dislike any part of the movie. I've been called a Communist, un-American, and other worse things for hating this movie. Really what is the point. I don't put other people down for not liking movies I like. Everybody's is entitled to their own opinion. Furthermore, I thought I lived in (and fought for) a country where I can like or dislike whatever movie I want. I don't like movies because everyone else does, and just because Hollywood or the media says that a movie is good, doesn't mean that it is. In fact I tend to disagree with Hollywood a lot. Anyway, isn't having to like something that's jammed down my throat communist in itself? Anyway, if I had to choose between becoming a communist and liking this movie, I would choose communism without a second thought or regret.If I was rating this movie on how much I actually liked it, I would give it a -infiniti just on the stupid screenplay alone. Too bad, it took awhile for ""The Shawshank Redemption"" to get popular, or that would have swept the Oscars that year."

tt0429078,"SIGHHHHHHH.... 1. I have never seen a Chinese action film that is so badly edited. I hardly making movie reviews, but this movie made me get off the couch, switch off the movie and head straight to IMDb. 2. With fighting scenes that are all jumbled up and don't make any sense. I love Kung Fu films, and this is possibly the worst directed film. 3. Have you ever seen a sword fight that you would ask your friend, ""What's going on?"" A real waste. 4. The camera focuses way too close to the body, there is no breathing space, no chance to actually appreciate each of the attack/defense sequence of the fight. I could not watch the full DVD. 5. Also the voice dubbing is off and all studio recorded. 6. Go watch Hero, Crounching Tiger, House of Flying daggers, Jet Li films. 7. Superficial characters, unbelievable weapons, and over dramatized expressions that leaves this the most overrated Asian film in 2005."
tt0468569,"Normally I would give this a 7.5 out of 10 but since I cant' I'll give it a seven. How anyone could rate this title that high on IMDb.com is amazing to me. It's mostly fanboys that believe this is the best movie ever and the best thing since sliced bread but what most fanboys fail to notice because they lack objectivity is that while the movie is a good one, it is quite flawed and nowhere near as perfect as many of the fanboys have rated.A couple things I noticed when I watch this movie, the movie goes on way too long. Even my friends agreed and they are huge Batman fans. There are about 3 or 4 points in the movie where it seems like it will end but goes on for another 30 minutes. And while Heath Ledger's performance is top notch and Bale as Bruce Wayne is pulled of quite flawlessly, his Batman persona is a bit weak. The voice is annoying, and many times throughout the movie, he seemingly plays second fiddle.I can't know Eckhart's casting as Two Face but Maggie Gyllenhall just doesn't seem to fit and just seems to be a standalone piece of eye candy.There are many things I can harp about but I'm not here to knock the movie. There are good points, cinematography great, Joker and Two Face played excellently by their counterparts, mood was effective and story flowed quite well albeit a bit too long.BUT this movie doesn't even belong in mention to some of the greats and shame on many movie fans that had this movie rated higher than such classics as The Godfather. Obviously the fanboys bought way too much into the hype."
tt0468569,"The true way Batman was meant to be told; I think Joaquin Phoenix was a great joker, but Heath ledgers performance is unmatched and truly frightening to watch."
tt0429078,"Just got the HK 3 DVD set and watched the film unlike any other.. and MY GOD! THIS FILM IS A Masterpiece! I was so moved ... if you do one more thing in your life before you die .. see this film! It's true...I am sure your are all familiar with the story, however, I think that i couldn't spoil it for you because it's all the visual direction that's so extraordinary and original. At it's basic level, the story follows the characters' adventures and interactions through out the film and we're getting right into their own mind and destinies that brought them together. The movie exactly feels like it's a beginning of something very big... the whole friendship and personalities of all swordsmen is still not as tight, clear and developed... and that's a good thing as we'll be slowly witnessing the whole build up of the characters through the entire series.Just like many other Tsui Hark's films, ""Seven Swords"" is gorgeous. The action and costume design in the film is extraordinary and there are so many frames that are just beautiful and indescribable, it's just something what has to be seen. The use of camera movement is as intriguing as the movement and choreography of the main swordsmen, and I really can't think of anything but this film or recollect any other wuxia film that could get even close to the monumental magnificence of ""Seven Swords"". It's great to know that there's so many others who were also so deeply affected by this incredible work of art.The certain characters become in the mid of the film very colourful, and fleshed out enough so that the viewer feels they know them, but still not enough that they'd know everything about them, and that's one of the elements intentionally left out for many other sequels. The past is something what's haunting these characters, in many ways that is a thematic point of the film that is truly just about the destiny, redemption and peace and love that all the swordsmen want to achieve (and hopefully ""will"" achieve in the process of the ongoing sequels) and as we follow the moving and struggling drama between and in the minds of the characters we may even come to understand something within ourselves. It is truly a very humanistically inspirational for the viewers, and should be noted that much more so than was even ""Seven Samurai"". Seven Swords is just a brilliant example of the true power of the cinema. And Tsui Hark once again proves that he's an unadulterated cinematic genius. It seems that some people still don't know what film can do to the viewer's senses, Tsui Hark does."
tt0172495,"OK, everybody loves this movie, which can only make me wonder, why?  Why has America become so easy to fool?  We see the trailer for a film like `Gladiator' and get all pumped up and slap our $8.00 down as soon as we can. But after sitting through 2 ¬Ω hours of a slow, unoriginal story, I could feel nothing but disappointment.Yes, I will admit that there are some cool scenes (the first fight in the Roman Coliseum is by far the best), but that's not enough to make a good movie.  We start with an ok  plot, but one key element is missing ¬ñ CHARACTER.  None of these characters have any substance to them at all. They are all flat, stereotypical boring characters that have little to nothing of importance to say.  I won't blame the actors, I think all of them have shown what they are capable of with a good script, but with a bad one ¬ñ not even the most talented of actors can save a film.  So, that is probably the biggest problem here, a poor script that lacks true character development and interesting dialogue.But the direction is also poor.  It was like Ridley was trying to do a little  `Saving Private Ryan' but did not succeed in doing it nearly as well.  To compare it to a similar film - `Braveheart' ¬ñ we see why `Braveheart' was a much more interesting film, because it had  a great bunch of characters that the audience identified with and cheered on.  `Gladiator' just could not deliver, and boy ¬ñ was the ending disappointing.  I'm sorry people ¬ñ if anybody can tell me why this is such a  movie, please do so, but this movie just reinforces for me the idea that Hollywood will always undermine the intelligence of its audience.  `Gladiator' gets a big fat 3 from me."
tt0167261,"I may be committing cinema heresy here, but I have complaints about the second Lord of the Rings film, The Two Towers. Number One: It is excessively long. I know the books that the movie is based on is really really long, and for a book, that's a good thing. When someone is reading a good book, they never want to put it down, they want to be with Frodo and Sam forever as they dodge ring raiders and enter Mordor, the home of Mt. Doom where the ring must finally end up. However, for a movie, it's tough to sit through a 3 hour plus movie, especially one that consists of nearly one hour of fighting between the good guys and the bad guys. What I personally find fascinating with the Lord of the Rings, the mythology of the ring and how the different characters are allowed to act within the rules of the Middle Earth universe, is there, but is pushed aside in favor of a dark, muddy fight. That leads to Complaint Number Two: There are too many characters for non-die hards to keep track of. Perhaps these two complaints come from the fact that my attention span is not as good as it used to be. Now the good: Gollum makes Jar-Jar Binks looks like a Simpsons' cartoon character. The combination of stop-action and CGI animation, Gollum the whithered hobbit looks totally believable and is the most interesting character in the saga, I think. What happened to him? Will the same thing happen to Frodo? These are questions I had that were spurred on by watching the Two Towers. The walking, talking trees are also a triumph in technology, something like this could not happen just a few years ago. The Empire Strikes Back is the best of the 3 Star Wars films, I think The Two Towers is the weakest of the Lord of the Rings films, so there is no definitive word on whether the middle chapter of trilogy suffers or gains compared to the surrounding chapters. It is not a bad film, again it looks great, has interesting characters, but I just wish some fat was trimmed off the film. I know die-hards would have a fit, but the length does keep some casual movie go-ers away, and there is plenty, especially in the end fight scene, to be taken away. But Peter Jackson has a houseful of Oscars, and I don't, so what do I know?"
tt0422272,"Fragile is an excellent film, taut, suspenseful and well written, with excellent acting from the leads, genuinely frightening imagery and direction and an excellent story. The movie's storyline starts off small and mysterious and builds up into one of the best psychological horror climaxes I've seen in years.Calista Flockhart is excellent, playing a tortured nurse who is grieving over an accident with a previous patient and just getting back on her feet when she's sent to a remote hospital on the Isle of Wight. Trouble is, this hospital is largely empty due to a nearby accident which has seen all the patients except the children's ICU ward evacuated, and the hospital forced into closure. Except something doesn't want them to leave, and is systematically breaking the bones in their bodies to stop them.Fragile is a great mystery. In a way, this film feels like the video game Silent Hill, with strange goings on happening in a hospital and one plucky individual attempting to unravel them as events rapidly spiral out of supernatural control. The eventual truth of the mystery is horrific and disturbing, and leads to an eventual confrontation that I won't spoil but is one of the most surreal and terrifying sequences I've seen in a long time.There's only really two things I'd say against it. This is not, in any way shape or form, a nice film. It opens with a child having his leg shattered in bed by an unseen ghostly attacker, and is in many ways one of the most disturbing mainstream films I've seen in a long time, partially because of the very original nature of the horror present in the hospital, but also because the spirits are attacking children.Indeed this leads me onto my other warning. Like Jaume Balaguero's previous film Darkness, Fragile's American release has suffered heavily at the hands of overzealous in-house censors who saw an opportunity to pump an edited version of the movie out into the cinema with a PG13 to sell to the post-Ring teenage horror audience. Hence the US version has various more menacing sequences removed, some of which are pivotal to understanding what's going on, and I'm told has a lot of swearing replaced with re-dubs like Darkness, which ludicrously had a forced audio track which replaced every f**k in the film with freak instead.It's a shame that this excellent directors work is not getting through properly due to his directing style. Like Guillermo Del Toro, Balaguero works with a varied age cast and isn't precious about what happens to the cast as relates to age. Also, an element of his directing style is that at points, characters completely lose it in the face of whatever terror is present, and believably swear blindly. We all know how dim a view Hollywood has of children being put in dangerous situations and we all know how actual realistic swearing puts their back up too hence this movie has again been butchered to make it more 'American'.Watch a European cut of this or if available an Unrated version, and enjoy what I honestly think is the best Western horror I've seen this decade. Great work."
tt0137523,"This film starts out good then it just disappoints.  It just gets stupid and stupider.  The first half hour led me to believe it was going to be good. Edward Norton attending support groups for problems and diseases he pretended to have.  Trying to get Seconal for his insomnia.  This film could have been so much better.  By the way, I do not care for Brad Pitt.  Not worth watching.  2/10"
tt0133093,"OK- don't get me wrong this was a groundbreaking movie. However I have some serious problems with it.First the good. The action scenes and special effects are awesome. They really did set new standards and knocked that hackneyed load of tripe The Phantom menace into the bin. The ending is also fantastic- there is no way that an ending this perfect was meant to be followed by two mediocre sequelsHowever, The plot is more full of holes than a fishnet stocking. For instance- I know this is nit picking- but how can Cypher be betraying the crew when not only do they have to plug him into the matrix for him to go and meet the agents in the first instance, but are also monitoring said conversation.Secondly- the philosophical parts. The matrix basically asks the question is it better to live the dream. The flaw comes in that in this case it is quite clearly better- great, so mankind is not ""free"" but each person lives a sufficiently realistic existence inside their own head for it not to matter. If the alternative is living in fear and squalor, dodging sentinels whilst eating what looks like congealed semen then I would frankly rather live inside my own dreams dining on fine food etc.Next up, the acting. Could someone please explain to me how Keanu Reeves is a leading man. He single handedly trashes all the good work put in by the supporting cast- especially Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving. Anyway how can I be expected to take a film seriously where Keanu is effectively god?Overall, a reasonable film but not the second coming of Christ so many people think it is."
tt0120815,"A script that begins with a credible concept of wartime legal necessity, then winds up at the dead end of a Private baldly disobeying a superior officer - and STAYING in the war - is almost unworthy of comment.  More believable scenarios (with laugh-track) came out of ""Hogan's Heroes"".Maybe there's a pacifist motivation in having the guy disobey his superior, then having the superior meaninglessly die.  (""War - what is it good for?"") But the other half of that 50% chance is that the writer or writers just didn't know what else to do with this thing.  After all, they clearly didn't intend to write ""Midway"" or ""Patton""."
tt0111161,"If you simply see this as a straightforward storytelling prison film, then it is excellent (10/10) because it truly gets you involved in its main character. It is an extremely enjoyable and compelling experience with a heartfelt and well-acted buddy-story at its core. It delicately--and sometimes brutally--juxtaposes Andy Dufresne's (Tim Robbins) good-natured character with the harshness of prison life, projecting so much heart in doing so.However delightful as it is, The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance. It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches - it's only a very safe buddy-story. A damn good one, but still just that. So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied, because what will it be remembered for? Friendship? Huh, neat. I therefore don't think it's entirely deserving of being considered the #2 greatest film of all time on IMDb.com.But moving on and looking past that, it is possibly one of my all-time favourite films for the feelings it leaves. Sure, it often jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely, but this is forgivable because emotion is crucial to a prison story. On top of that, it never falls prey to predictable sappiness - probably because of its content which is devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic friendship. It is so well-sewn together by a feel-good narrative by Morgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film.9/10"
tt0993846,"Just back from the wolf of wall street. Its story is based on autobiography written by Jordan Belfort. So as is usual with all autobiography, the author will portray himself a hero. Its an entertaining film but a stupid film. Right from the selling techniques of de caprio to the money laundering in swiss banks , everything is too convenient and at times plain stupid.Its supposed to be a dark comedy but the tone is Over the top.De Caprio is good in some scenes and has overacted in a lot of scenes. His scene where he has an excessive effective of a drug is so loud and drags too much its almost irritating.He looks like an overgrown kid with wrinkles. Jonah Hill is also good in some scenes and hammed in many other. Margot Robbie plays De Caprio's wife. Looks hot and acts the best among the cast. I am surprised how it has won so many award nominations, May be due to the big names associated.That is how most of the jury around the world works"
tt0108052,"This is, after all, one of the more...for lack of a better word...*necessary* films to appear in recent years. Yes, humans can fall to such depths. Yes, such rampant disregard for all we hold sacred--for life, for simple virtues--is possible. Yes, such bestiality has been, is today, will be again. ...entertaining??? Perish the thought. Nothing, absolutely NOTHING about this movie is entertaining. If you want entertainment this evening, watch something else. A Cary Grant comedy, a Mel Brooks film...anything else.But this is, when all is said and done, one of the most important films ever made...because it tells us something we need very much to know, or to remember:  On your guard! There have always been, will always be more Amon Goethes!! There will always be more Auschwitzes! ...but will I have the courage to be another Oskar Schindler??"
tt0137523,"The first half hour or so was pretty entertaining, even if most of it consisted of Edward Norton telling us what we were seeing (you know, God forbid we should use our abilities to surmise what's going on). And since I saw it on video, I could use slo-mo to catch Brad's ""Where's Waldo"" bits. As soon as Norton met Brad, it was all downhill. Even a really fine, insightful actor would have had a hard time making those pretentious lines sound significant, but Brad Pitt's spewing of them was like a nearsighted used car dealer reading cue cards. This movie was so obvious, so pretentious, and such a total con job, right up to the absurd plot twist three-quarters of the way through that completely invalidated everything that came before it. Also, for a movie that was so preachy about consumerism (""You are not your car, your khakis,"" all that hackneyed nonsense), did anyone else notice that all the tired young execs at Fight Club proper seemed to spend alot of time at the gym? Nary a pot belly to be found, save for poor Meat Loaf, who was somehow exempt from the ""no shirt/no shoes"" rule. Large-breasted Meat Loaf fighting shirtless--now that would have been shocking.Everything this movie had to say has been said before, and better. And sometimes just as badly. (See ""Zabriskie Point"" for another example of an overblown, smug rumination on being yourself and getting back to basics vs. evil products like Wonder Bread.)""Fight Club"" was just a cynical exercise from a self-important director seeing how much he could get away with."
tt0120737,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is an epic masterpiece directed by Peter Jackson. With compelling storytelling, stunning visual effects, and an exceptional cast, it masterfully transports the viewer to Tolkien's Middle-earth. The attention to detail and fidelity to the author's universe are remarkable, creating a cinematic experience that transcends time and genre. This film is a landmark in the history of fantasy cinema, thrilling and captivating generations of viewers with its epic and unforgettable magic. Majestic, timeless, and unforgettable journey. Absolutely iconic for me."
tt0848228,"Loud and overlong with minimal character and plot development and casual banter among the characters that feels more like a run through. Likewise, the conflict and plot don't really seem to matter, and there is no tension, suspense or pacing. Each scene is on same level as the one before; you could watch this film with the scenes arranged in virtually any order. This thing totally lacks momentum. The expensive cast does well enough, but the film's length and one-dimensional plot grows tiresome and the noisy soundtrack seems designed to prevent dozing. The Avengers is not particularly recommendable, nothing about it is memorable or original and it's not a film I feel any need to revisit. It's a passable time killer; nothing more."
tt1375666,"But it's got its heart in the right place. First it's too long by at least a half-hour. Second it relies too much on frenetic activity to cover up its more grievous shortfalls. And third it's not really sci-fi, it's more a psychological thriller. But despite all that it is what it is portraying, an attempt to implant a notion, and that's highly commendable on several levels. Also a few of the scenes are both memorable and essentially flawless.The acting's all there too despite what some critics claim. DiCaprio is capable and fully invested. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is especially engaging, but the casting of Ellen Page was a near fatal mistake if you ask me. I can see why she made sense to the director and producers, but she's a drag on the movie as is Ken Watanabe who I could barely understand half the time. Still I like his acting and I can tolerate his pronunciation here. Page I don't like for some reason. Perhaps it's just too distracting and/or annoying to see her exude an almost pre-adolescent lack of experience again. If they needed an 'innocent', and I don't really agree, I would have preferred Dakota Fanning. Marion Cotillard does the exact opposite, she's worldly and knowing, but her I'd like to protect and get to know personally.I would have liked to see a slower more moody treatment of this topic. Though at least one of the chase scenes is masterful and hair-raising, the real pay dirt would have been imagining trying to enter another person's mind. In fact the separation between our minds is the bedrock on which most of our problems lay. A 'shared dream' as portrayed here would have been several notches more paradigm breaking than depicted here, I think, and that's no small flaw in this film."
tt0133093,"** May contain spoilers **There aren't many movies I watched in the theatre twice  let alone on the same day - but immediately after the credits had rolled (and still pumped up by 'Rage against the Machine'), I queued up for the next screening of 'The Matrix'. I was so blown away by that film, I feared - and probably rightly so - that I hadn't caught every detail of what I'd just seen. I later found out that many of my friends had had a similar reaction to the film, and I know virtually no one who liked the film and didn't watch it at least twice. It's simply one of those rare films that are so rich you just have to watch them several times.In structure, style and concept, 'The Matrix' was ground-breaking; it marked the first time the visual style of Manga comic books and Anime such as 'Akira' or 'Ghost in the Shell' had been successfully translated to a live-action film. Apart from 'Blade Runner', which has a totally different mood and pace (but is also a masterpiece and visionary film-making), there simply hadn't been anything even remotely like it. The jaw-dropping action sequences have such a raw, gripping energy they feel like an adrenalin overdose, but unlike most action films, they never overshadow the story; on the contrary - they enhance it and make complete sense within that universe.As for the story itself, I think this is one of the most original, fascinating Sci-Fi tales you'll likely ever see on screen. Clearly inspired by Japanese Anime and Manga yet also by authors like Isaac Asimov or Philip K. Dick, the story about humanity's war against its own creation, machines of an artificial intelligence that have evolved to the point where they have become the dominant 'species' and vastly superior to their creators, could take place in the same world as 'Blade Runner' or 'The Terminator' - albeit several hundred years later. But there is also a mythical, even religious undercurrent to the story; the themes of a prophecy, a ""liberator"" or even a ""messiah"" make 'The Matrix' transcend the Science-Fiction genre and become even more unique.'The Matrix' was a watershed moment in filmmaking  in every respect  and even though two inferior sequels have left a bit of a stain on the film, they can't distract from what an uncompromising and hugely influential masterpiece this is. Sci-Fi movies that were released after 'The Matrix' have tried very hard to achieve a similar look and tone, but the original still owns them all. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
tt0848228,"The Avengers represents everything that's bad in a hero movie. In my opinion, this movie should be nominated for one of the most disappointing movie of the year. The movie is not funny, barely action and has a terrible plot. the villain in the movie, Loki, was the most bad villain character in the history of movies and not in the good way. I hope for me and for everybody else that there will not be a sequel, because it will ruin everything that batman has built about a comics movie. I was merciful and gave it 3/10 because Robert Downey Jr. succeed to do something good in this movie, but for the rest of the cast, you owe me 2.5 hours from my life."
tt1130884,"This is the kind of thriller Scorsese tried to make where the viewer is lead through the plot from the trauma induced, delusional perspective of the main character, only there's too many flashback distractions to make any sense of it all. The flashbacks are what gave away the end for me. I knew it pretty early on in the movie.However, the premise is fascinating from another perspective they only touched upon which is the idea of how anyone could be brainwashed into thinking and doing anything if given the proper support system much like what happened in ""The Manchurian Candidate"". I actually thought that was where it was going.What's not explained in the movie is from where the main character is deriving his delusions while participating in the mental hospital's roll playing therapy experiment. What induced the delusion to roll play as a US Marshal? Why choose to be a US Marshal? Was this his occupation before the actual trauma occurred that caused his psychosis?What was the seed of information that caused him to delude specifics like imagining finding a former doctor hiding out in a cave whose escaping a delusion of her own. Why would shooting your wife for drowning the children cause you to make up all that stuff? Usually in movies there's a seed of reality and logic that starts the spiral downward toward paranoid delusional psychosis this guy was experiencing. To many holes in the logic for me to suspend my disbelief.Great idea for a movie, though. It's just clumsily executed."
tt0167260,"Everyone is gushing about this film, and mostly for good reasons.  It's the crowning film of one of the best trilogies ever filmed.  It appeals to tons of people because it's based on a timeless story, it's well acted, it's filmed beautifully, and the effects don't overwhelm it like they would a Lucas effort.That said, it's far from a perfect film, and to me, not even the best of the three (I find The Two Towers to be the most consistent of the three).  It is not just the oft-repeated idea that the ending is far too long (it kind of is, but probably wouldn't seem to drag on so long if not for the tons of material cut out of the start and the middle of the film), but rather for the really uneven pacing of the film.  It seems 2/3 of the time is spent with Frodo and Samwise crawling up to Shelob and then only five minutes going across Mordor towards Mount Doom.  This is very odd to me, as if getting passed Cirith Ungol was the real feat, not the trek across the waterless, foodless plain.  The Army of the Dead was one of the most amazing aspects of the film, but they appear abruptly and disappear almost as quickly, making them a passing rather than a salient point of the battle. And, of course, there are the elements the purists complain about, which I found would have really aided in the storytelling:  Denethor's corruption by Sauron and the breaking of Saruman's hold after the battle with the ents would have smoothed it out a ton, and they could have kept the length failry the same by editing out some other parts.  Arwen, for example, was basically unnecessary as the story unfolded--leave her out; if the scouring of the Shire is unnecessary, why do we even need to go back at all, when they could just head to the ships and end it there, or even better, just end it at the ceremony on top of Minas Tirith?  I know there was an effort to keep it as true to the book, but I think Jackson made some basic errors in storytelling that keeps it far from the ranks of a ten, much like the problems with The Hulk earlier in the year.Good, but not great.  6/10"
tt0361748,"I'm in neither camp, though I lean toward liking it.What I didn't like about it: Reviewers complaining that Tarantino has fallen in love with himself are to some extent correct. Excerpting Morricone's spaghetti western soundtracks for Kill Bill really worked; here it feels gratuitous and tacked-on. There are other elements (like the constant film-geek-friendly jokes on characters' names, cf. ""Hugo Stiglitz"") that create the impression that Tarantino feels the need to do this stuff now simply because it's come to be expected. And the inclusion of David Bowie in the film score is, from a director known for his uncanny talent with matching music to the visuals, a rare and aggravating misstep.What was just middle of the road: (EDIT: I originally said here that the Nazis were expiring as a class of film villain. How quaint *that* sentiment looks in 2017. Turns out they're more relevant than ever, sadly.) If it was that easy to kill Hitler, one of the myriad assassination attempts from real history would probably have worked. Additionally and most problematically, it's not plausible for the Basterds to have had the track record they achieved behind German lines without any of them being able to speak German -- indeed, this whole premise clashes with a key factor that a major scene in the movie turns on. So, those are all flaws, albeit not film-sinking flaws.What was great: Every single person who logged in here to complain about the ""pointless"" and ""overlong"" dialogue scenes has renounced, for all time, any right at all to criticize Tarantino's ""taste"" or timing or sense of the craft. What he knows and what you don't -- and the main reason this movie is garnering the positive reviews it is -- is how powerful a tool TENSION is. Basterds is replete with scenes that build and release tension absolutely masterfully; the opening interrogation scene is the best example, but far from the only one. Tarantino's extraordinary gift for dialogue and tension is what saves the movie from its admitted flaws. All that's required in order to appreciate this gift is an attention span.He's also helped by some tremendous performances. Melanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz -- in a pair of superb performances -- have already gotten lots of well-earned attention. There's also great work from Fassbender and Diehl, and others besides. And yes, Brad Pitt -- the dozens of comments maligning him notwithstanding -- does an excellent job of establishing Aldo Raines as a shrewd and formidable character, for all that his Tennessee accent isn't authentic.Overall and with its flaws taken into account, it's a fun and entertaining film, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it."
tt0361748,"This is a perfect Tarantino movie. It's explosive and exciting while also deep and well thought out. It took me a minute to get used to reading so many subtitles because of the variety of languages used, but I think that's a quality that makes the movie even more enticing. It is incredibly well done and it had a hold of me from beginning to end. Fair warning for any Tarantino movie, be prepared for the gore and violence. It runs rampant throughout the movie, but it's kind of gratifying seeing it happen to the Nazis."
tt0111161,"This movie is more of a drama than action, but that doesn't matter, because it would fail in either case. A viewer can accept the clich√© of the wrongly convicted man, but this case is deceptively against the grain. Our society already has a predisposition to acquit any man of murdering his wife, a predisposition to think it is impossible, when the statistics claim the opposite. For that reason alone, this movie is dangerous propaganda, and most often a lie. The characters never become believable, mostly because of the reason stated earlier. Also, because such men don't wind up in prison. The wrongly convicted man always comes from a different background and class. I can't imagine someone finding this movie even remotely plausible. In fact, the viewer has no idea what the ""redemption"" is. Nothing makes any sense."
tt0111161,"Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come."
tt0120815,"The opening beach assault sequences were the most violent, realistic, and upsetting filming I've ever seen; looked as though the thing was actual combat footage. The shushing noises of rounds cutting through the air was the most chilling part of all. Perfect portrayal of the insane stupidity of war and the anguish of all who enter this most foolish of enterprises. A must see."
tt0068646,"The first movie I've ever watched that left me with the feeling that I saw something bigger than just a movie. I remember it really well - I was 16, my parents were abroad and I watched it at home with a couple of good friends. When you remember the time and setting you watched a movie so well, it is because it really touched you and influenced you, and that's what I think that movie did to me. You really should watch it. It is an offer you can't refuse!"
tt0111161,"Sorry folks but this movie is a C movie and not an A. I can't believe that people like this movie so much. Yes I am biased, I really don't like Tim Robbins but he has made a decent movie or two but this ain't one of them. This is your basic prison movie. What can I say- it has the host of usual characters.  The storyline is basic, the outcome I won't say but it is just stupid to say that this is a great movie. I didn't think it was realistic at all and anybody who falls for this crap is either delusional or needs some brains to differentiate between an Edsel and a Lamborghini. I wouldn't watch this movie again unless I was paid to do so. One viewing is enough for this predictable laugher."
tt1345836,"There's a common misconception when it comes to The Dark Knight Rises especially regarding how it tackles it's themes and story: this film isn't trying to raise the stakes, it's trying to add to the story, in this case his loneliness, his sense of powerlessness.Hans Zimmer's score is some of the best I've ever heard, Wally Pfister peaked, had the best choreographed action scenes out of the whole trilogy, had the most emotionally resonant story out of the trilogy for sure. A very well made and satisfying conclusion that makes this trilogy one of the best .. ever?A perfect comic book movie, certainly one of my favourites of all time"
tt0848228,"I'm coming out straight up to say this is ¬Ühe most freaking amazing comic movie adaptation I have ever seen....Best movie of 2012, best marvel adaptation ever.I have to say, what ¬Ühe freaking ....... Fuzz!!!!! I can't believe I've just seen a movie as great as this from Hollywood. Where could it ever go wrong? From cast ensemble, to Character arc to character development, to story, to OMG spectacular kick-ass action... -pause to catch my breath- my mind is still spiraling from what I have just seen. This is a movie I want to watch this next minute if I have ¬Ühe chance!!My only downside to this movie though is not seeing it in time.. oops ha that is no downer to ¬Ühe movie itself. It made me laugh, get tear eyed, marvel in wonder at pure awesomeness, jump out of my seat, tremble in fear, its just great. Sorry I can't find ¬Ühe words still. As large as ¬Ühe hype to this movie is, it still didn't do justice to how awesome this movie is. gosh!!!Great job Joss Whedon. He really is a passionate comic book writer who does justice to this ensemble, shuffling up things to boiling point between characters and I can't even start to describe his major villain whose actor gives an Oscar worthy performance.Never had a bad-ass bad guy that kept me awestruck this much since ¬Ühe matrix. Tom Hiddlestone does justice to this character in a way that truly signifies a real god of mischief. Scheming and plotting with thoughts and plans coming at split second intervals, Tom Hiddlestone still gives his character that dynamism of a brainiac with deep inner pain that you'd think could boil over at any moment.Mind blowing movie for a super hero generation. If u are a comic book fan, you would drool over this movie and I'm not just saying. If you are not even, there's no reason why you shouldn't watch this movie still. It just couldn't go wrong.*Panting*"
tt7286456,"45 minutes the first night, red wine. 45 minutes the second night, no wine. Why did I waste my time. Sorry but this is crap."
tt1345836,"The best thing about this movie is how satisfying it is. It doesn't leave you frustrated or confused. You can't really complain that it didn't explore certain ideas or follow through. By deciding to have an official ending to this trilogy's story, the themes surrounding Batman are very fresh. We don't know where he'll end up. It's not the same old thing about whether he can continue to be Batman or not, which was already getting repetitive in Spider-man 2. The conclusions are not as important as the feelings they invoke as they come about. Nolan is especially good at capturing the complete tension of actually not knowing what will happen and deeply questioning what you *want* to happen and why.This movie is bigger than the previous two, far more ambitious. There are no obvious annoying weaknesses that usually come with films in general, especially blockbuster action movies. All of Nolan's movies have deep psychological themes and this takes those in another new direction. I thought Inception was hugely original and insightful about the way people think. That level of abstraction and depth is present in this film. Bane bursts into it, his reputation is quickly established. Nolan uses people's expectations and anticipation to the fullest. We are left to wonder about what has happened in the 8 years since the events of The Dark Knight. Why have the characters become the way they are now?In the latter half, it does seem like the movie is trying to pull off so many different plot points and connections, but they all work. The cast is very large and impressive. You don't see ""good acting"". You see fascinating characters. They're just playing their part in the grand story that's being crafted. There are many unfamiliar faces but they all have a strange, unique look to them. We often see a person's flaws and previous decisions coming back to haunt them. They find out the hard way what mistakes they have made. Where their limits are. Where they lose control.The score is almost tribal, very raw and energetic. You don't get much chance to pay attention to it but many parts of the movie are pounding with excitement. There are countless quotable lines and disturbing slices of dialogue. They cut deep. The Joker was a great character and this is a very different movie but the themes are just as dark, only perhaps indirectly. Underneath, it's very sinister. Writing and efficiency appear to be among Nolan's greatest strengths. The story has many layers that interweave and apparently they came in under budget.Perhaps the most important thing about Catwoman is that she's completely believable. When she beats up men, you don't roll your eyes. She's feminine and powerful in her own way. She fits into the world and we completely understand her motivations. She doesn't have a huge role but a very important one.I didn't find myself moved but maybe I'm too cynical. I was more affected psychologically. Curious about humanity and all the different sides of it you see in this movie. It goes to many extremes. I felt humbled by my complete lack of life experience. What do I know about anything? How could I possibly understand half of the characters? I haven't been through anything or achieved anything compared to most of them. Michael Caine gets a bigger role this time. He was always critical but this time he's very much the emotional core.I thought Christian Bale was overlooked in The Dark Knight especially. The movies hinge on him. Bruce Wayne's just a man but also incredibly inspirational. Bale's famous for completely committing to his roles and it pays off. Tom Hardy is impressive as Bane but I suppose that's no surprise. The rest of the leads are similarly awesome. There are many references to the earlier films. Very few questions are left unanswered. It's always nice when film-makers really think it through and make an actual decision and get all the details right.So anyway, I'll miss Batman (since the trilogy has ended) but couldn't have hoped for a better, more epic and sincere finale to his story."
tt0068646,"This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers.

tt0629374,"Decided a while back (three years ago) to review all the episodes of the original 'Law and Order', 'Special Victims Unit' and 'Criminal Intent', being someone who really likes all three shows in their prime/early years. Really loved a lot of the early seasons episodes of all three shows, while also finding all three less consistent later on (with the original not feeling the same post-Briscoe and even began to lose consistency in Season 11, 'Special Victims Unit' was the one that declined the most though).This is a very harrowing subject. Season 11 did a lot of not easy subjects (which was always one of 'Law and Order's' main selling points), but the execution varied. Some episodes handled them very uncompromisingly and powerfully. Others did them rather too on the heavy-handed side and a few times with hard to swallow legal scenes. One of the toughest subject matters of the season is with ""Phobia"". Which is one of the finer examples of the former category, so uncompromising and powerful.It does seem quite ordinary at first, but it does quickly become an episode that is often anything but.""Phobia's"" production values continue to remain high, while the direction lets the dramatic intensity of the second half to blister. The music doesn't sound melodramatic. The script is lean and thoughtful, especially in the legal scenes and indeed the priceless interrogation scene with the hilariously dumb Santo Fazio.Story hooks one in early on and never lets go, and is also shocking, tense and heart-breakingly tragic in the second half. Which is absolutely riveting, pulls no punches and never comes over as too simple or over-complicated. The supporting characters are more real here than most supporting characters this season, though not many characters come off well afterwards. One does hate the perpetrator, certainly so these days where reactions towards homophobia are a good deal stronger, but one hates even more the character that made them act that way.Cannot find anything to fault the performances for, Jerry Orbach (Briscoe being one of the best loved characters in the franchise is very much deserved) and Jesse L. Martin always were my favourite police pairing of the show, while Sam Waterston is in full command of his role. Catherine Kellner makes the skin crawl. Fazio is hilarious in his screen time.All in all, excellent. 9/10."
tt0133093,"I really can't understand all of the accolades that this film continues to receive.  Has the entire world gone insane and forgotten that what makes a good movie is its script.  Has everything become about special effects, special effects and more special effects?   Sure, if you want special effects, this is definitely the movie for you.  If I was writing this entry for the Special Effects Message Board, I would have given it a 10/10 rating. But frankly, I need more than great visuals to have a movie work for me and as this film has nothing else, it gets a 1 rating.I know my rating won't dissuade the masses from singing the praises of this movie.  I know that my rating won't stop the inevitable outcome of Matrix II becoming the highest grossing film of all time during its opening weekend. Perhaps the only thing this review will do is lead like minded people in the direction of other movies that deal with similar themes yet actually have characters that you will care about.Let me make clear, that the core concept of Matrix is a great one.  The whole idea of our world being part of someone else's imagination is something that has fascinated me for as long as I can remember.  When Matrix originally debuted, you couldn't have paid me to stay away from the theater. Someone had finally put one of the great philosophic debates into movie form and I knew that it had to be incredible.   Instead, the only thing incredible about the film (beside the special effects) was how wrong I had been.There on the screen was a movie without any real screenplay.  No matter how much I tried, I couldn't bring myself to care about these characters because they just weren't real.   You would think that in a film dealing with reality-as-you-know-it crumbling around the main characters, that there would be some exploration into how the newly revealed reality affected their psyches.   But that doesn't happen here.  Instead, we are given a movie where the emphasis is placed upon stocking up on as many guns and other weapons as possible so that the bad guys can be shot and killed.   Give me a break!!!I think what has happened in these type of movies is that the producers are handed a great idea and then spend their entire budget on the actors and special effects.  They don't bother to spend anything on the screenplay because they have realized that good ones aren't necessary anymore.  Just give the public some nice CGI and they'll flock to the theatre. Unfortunately, they seem to be right.   Movies like Matrix and and the Jurassic Park series continue to sell out even though the stories are horrible.  Give us a cool CGI Dinosaur running around a city or make the lead characters do CGI kung-fu moves and we'll go home happy.   Never mind that we have absolutely no insight into who the main characters are.  We don't need to care about them as long as they are involved in computerized situations!   (Did anyone actually give a damn whether Jeff Goldblum's character lived or died in Lost World?)Anyway - my point is that you can certainly make a film exploring ideas and concepts similar to those in these mega movies and still have the audience care about the characters.In the case of Matrix, for those interested in a good ""reality-as-you-know-it"" type of movie, I would suggest Josef Rusnak's 'Thirteenth Floor' or even better yet, if you can handle sub-titles, Alejandro Amenabar's ""Open Your Eyes"".   Both of these movies manage to give you an incredible story, with characters you will remember long after the credits have rolled.  Believe it or not, you'll actually find yourself wondering about the characters' futures rather than simply commenting on how cool that CGI generated flip-in-the-air was.Good movies are supposed to leave you with questions. They are supposed to make you think.  You didn't really have to do that with Matrix, and its a shame because the movie could and should have been so much more than it ended up being.In my opinion, Matrix was a waste of both time and money.  I will just keep praying that one day the movie going public will give up on these special effects monsters and turn back to the days of enjoying movies with plots. On that day, films like ""Open Your Eyes"" will finally get their due and Hollywood will stop giving us mere eye candy like Matrix and similar ilk."
tt0361748,"Firstly, I want to make one thing clear:I'm German but I don't have a problem with Germans being the bad guys in movies. The depiction of Germans in this movie didn't offend me. There were lots of other reasons for me not to like Inglourious Basterds.I didn't have high expectations, but still it was very disappointing. I was surprised how little action this had and how boring it all was. The plot is very thin and there are a lot of absolutely pointless and painfully long scenes. Some may be fooled by this into thinking the movie actually had depth. But I think Tarantino really didn't know what he was doing. Despite the huge amount of dialogue the characters remained one dimensional and boring (with maybe one or two exceptions).The violence in-between all that boredom seemed misplaced, unnecessary and therefor really disgusted me. Want an example? There's a scene where a German officer gets brutally beaten to death with a baseball bat for not providing strategic information. He was only protecting his fellow soldiers and was actually very brave. Are we supposed to think this is perfectly acceptable because he was a Nazi? Or was this even supposed to be funny?This movie also failed from an artistic point of few. The direction and camera work was underwhelming at best. The music was horrible and didn't fit at all. Overall, there wasn't any consistent style to this movie, just a lot of pieces that didn't match.I'd rate this even lower if it weren't for Christoph Waltz's great performance as Hans Landa and a few good laughs. This is a highly overrated mediocre B-movie at best. And for me it's more proof that Tarantino isn't the great writer/director everybody took him for after Pulp Fiction. 4 out of 10."
tt0114369,"I don't really get this movie, it is met with such high acclaim,yet it doesn't really have anything to show for it.From the start i didn't like it,the tone is incessantly bland,the visuals are dull,they never even attempt to give any excitement to the audience,as if the story alone was enough to keep us entertained. The entire movie is a good concept with a disappointing realization, the series of murders influenced by the seven deadly sins and even though one or two cases do tend to shock and entertain us,altogether it's not as thrilling as it should be. As for the characters,Brad Pitt is horrible in this movie,it's like he forgot how to act,he never acts out the appropriate emotion and the last scene where he finds his wife's head in the box looked more like annoyance and disgust than shock,fear and trauma; of course,nihilism might have been the direction they were going to,another question pops in mind: ""Should a death of a loved one be a nihilistic reaction?"". Kevin Spacey's character would have been amazing if it weren't for his lack of motivation, his role was supposed to be that of an insane mastermind,but wouldn't he then have a better motive than an ""I wanna be famous"" attitude?In conclusion it's a bad movie,I see why people do tend do enjoy it for it has some noteworthy scenes,but the fact is that it mostly relies on build-up and shock,while the outcome is predictable,the atmosphere is boring and the ending is too rushed."
tt0120737,"Absolutely dire film. I was convinced by so many to watch this and i can't see why.I'm not sure whether to bother with the rest, but i'm told to stick to it.Basically, the first hour and half of the story is about a ring thats made to control all other rings (they have powers each one) and it's an evil ring. Over many years it gets passed on with untold past. Some hobbit find it and lives for 100 odd years old then decides to leave his town to die basically. That took 1 hour 30mins. The next hour is basically about the new guy with the ring, Frodo.So he has it, then there's a meeting of different 'creatures' ie dwarfs, wizards, humans etc to see what should be done about the bad ring. After arguing for 10mins they decide they should all help frodo throw it in a volcano - the one it is made from.Then the bull goes on with stupid weird sayings ""thy nose is as abscondant as a flower on a june wall in may besides a river of everlasting water"" or ""my land was bright with light, with white towers of beauty, corn was growing in fields, the sheeps all with legs..."" stupid annoying boring drawn out conversations about nothing.Frodo is captured by Octopus thingy, which dangles frodo over its mouth (i assume to eat\kill) for about 10 minutes whilst the rest chop away at the legs not holding Frodo. If I was the Octpus, he'd have been eaten whilst i used my other legs to hold the others before i eat them. Not growl at him 18 times whilst each leg is chopped off.I could go on writing about nothing that happened other than long sentences of random made up bull."
tt0120737,"...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've read ""The Lord of the Rings"" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Silmarillion"" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in ""The Hobbit"" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron.Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of 'Fellowship of the Ring' lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? I've read a reviewer saying he'd make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with 'Alvin and the Chimpmunks' kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least.Ok, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jackson's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson's, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; that's the thing with books: each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried ""ranger"". Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, he's willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the 'best friend' everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can't wait for his return.Quite frankly, I can't wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, I'll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25¬¢ novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure."
tt0167261,"While 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers (2002)' initially seems like an improvement upon its predecessor due to an almost instant start, to the point of totally leaving anyone not already on-board with the story behind, and constant 'in-the-moment' feel, the piece soon becomes a baggy and generally slow affair that does, in itself, seem like the so-called 'extended version' (how an actual 'extended version' exists, I'm not sure I'll ever fully understand). This middle instalment falls victim to its transitional status, which is essentially a kind way of saying that not all that much happens - at least not considering its bloated three hour run-time - while it ties the knot between the first and last part of its larger tale. It also suffers from a meandering narrative that opens up its world in a way that seems unfocused, taking away from the core - and, incidentally, most interesting - story of our protagonist and his journey to destroy that which would seek to destroy the world at every opportunity. There's still a lot to like, including a clarity of vision most prominent in the brilliant battle sequences - which are some of the largest in scale seen in cinema (only to be bested in size by its follow-up) and yet still retain a remarkably tangible quality - and smaller character moments - mainly surrounding its landmark 'motion capture' character. Indeed, this character is a groundbreaking achievement that did almost as much for the industry as the rest of the effects combined, being the premier creation of this kind essentially still to this day. He has some of the best moments in this feature, moments which are only slightly less interesting because of all the apparent 'filler' which surrounds them. It's made out to be essential perhaps because it sits in the source novel, but trimming sequences shouldn't be discouraged even in something based on a beloved book. This flick ends up perhaps the weakest of the trilogy. In the end, though, there are enough stand-out scenes and it's entertaining enough to make it more than worthwhile. 7/10"
tt0133093,"The Matrix brought in a mixed bag of both good and bad. On one side, its original story and setup for the next film is great, while on the other side, its mediocre acting, and aging visuals keep me from truly loving this film. So with that, I decided to give The Matrix a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. An above average score for an above average film.Read more at theVade."
tt0361748,"Brad Pitt sticks his index finger in Diane Kruger's leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants. Funny, horribly so. The invented yarn takes ""The Dirty Dozen"" for a ride and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other movies. Lots of fun. Even ""Paris when it sizzles"" is mentioned in a delightfully organic piece of dialog. I was thrilled by Christoph Waltzer's character and by his sensational performance. Brad Pitt creates a true original. I love the actor's lack of vanity. There's a quirk in the character that is pure Brad Pitt. Tarantino visits a new universe but. fortunately, his hand. his brain and his heart are visible all over the place."
tt0167260,"I read LOTR for the first time about 25 years ago, at a time when you had to look for the book in the darkest corner of your local bookstore. It was a time when reading SF or Fantasy resulted in funny looks from your pals, and raised eyebrows from your teachers.Now Peter Jackson turned this book into a mass phenomenon, and it is suddenly very trendy to out yourself as a LOTR fan. I have watched the directors cut of the first two parts at least ten times on DVD. Both extended versions are very good, and I do not know which one to prefer. My expectations for the third part were of course very high. After all, Peter Jackson liked it best, so it should be the best part of the trilogy.However, I do not think it is better than the first two parts. It is certainly a very good movie, but there are parts, which I did not like. This review contains spoilers, is more a nit picker's comment, and may also not be very helpful for people without a certain background knowledge of the books of Tolkien.1. Intro: Each of the three parts starts with an intro. In the first we see and here the background story on the war against Sauron with Gil Galad and Elendil. Brilliant. In the second, we see Gandalfs fight with the Balrog to a wonderful soundtrack. Brilliant. And in the third? Smeagols transformation into Gollum, mainly pretty disgusting...and not necessary for the understanding of the plot (we heard all about that already in the second part). Also, I found the acting not convincing. All together a week start, and not in the same league as the first parts.2. Isengard scene: Where was Saruman? What was that scene for? Just for Pippin to find the Palanthir in the muck? I surely hope that we get to see more on the DVD.3. To much of weary, dirty hobbits in the mud. The pacing is pretty slow, Gollum's schizophrenia was well established in part II. Not necessary for the plot and the movie.4. Arwen: My most loathed character of all three movies. Named third in the credits for a few unnecessary scenes. She acts like a young American girl (what she is) and not like a three thousand year old grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-aunt of Aragorn. What a difference in the few scenes we see with Galadriel!5. Aragorn: The title is the Return of the king. However, Aragorn does not get much to play this role. In the book, he challenges Sauron in the Palanthir and announces his return, whilst in the movie, he can barely hold the thing, and gets unconscious looking at it. I look forward to the DVD to hear Jacksons explanation of this unnecessary change. Also the path of the death story line is not convincing. If you read this in the book, it has a different flavour to it. The Death never fought in Minas Tirith, but for the movie it may have been useful, since it allowed to clean Minas Tirith of Orcs within a few seconds (Orcs, who had no business being there in the first place!). The unforgivable omission in Aragorn's character is that they did not show him as a healer. The Hands of the King are the Hands of a Healer. This is one of the most important parts of the third book, because it establishes Aragorn's right to the throne of Gondor, and gives him almost God like powers. To leave that out whilst wasting so much time on other redundant parts is very sad.6. Battle scenes: I must admit that the attack of the Rohirim is one of the best scenes in all three movies. (and Theoden a much better king than Aragorn, it was the other way round in the Two Towers! So Aragorn did not develop whilst Theoden did). But there is too much fighting. Too many lovely details of Orc gimmicks. From a story tellers point of few, the siege of Minas Tirith (saved by the cavalry!) is a larger copy of the siege of Helm's deep (saved by...the cavalry). In the book, the focus is not so much on this battle. It is a small part of the Return of the King (albeit a highlight), but in the movie, the battle seems to never end, the Orcs conquer almost the entire city (they do not even enter in the book), and Gandalf has lost his superior, god like powers of the book (after all, he is a Maiar, a sort of lesser angel), except in his lonely charge to help the returning Faramir.7. Denethor: What a caricature of the figure in the book! The steward is portrayed as a Shakespearean Richard III type villain, who is totally mad. Nobody bothers to explain, that he is fighting with Sauron in his personal Palanthir (just to have the power to look into such a thing repeatedly and NOT betray his people is something in his favour...)8. The fight with the Witch king: Very good movie adaptation, but still one of Tolkien's inconclusive scenes. At Amon Sul in the first movie, Aragorn chases away the witch king and four other wraiths with a burning stick and a lesser sword (although the ONE Ring was within inches of their grasp!). On the Pellenor field, the same Witch King is almost as powerful as Sauron himself, and no man can kill or defeat him. Why and where has he gained so much power?9. In the trailer we see Theoden knighting Merry on the top of Edoras. Did I miss this in the movie?10. Shelop's Lair. All together a very good adaptation, three nit picking comments: Shelop smells strongly in the book, so it is unlikely she could sneak up on Frodo like in the movie. In the movie she stings him in the chest or back (clearly in the middle of his body). But there he should be protected by his Mithril chain mail! Also, Sam could not get the ring out without destroying the cocoon.11. Finally, why on Middle earth did they not use the eagles in the first place for this quest? I am sure Gwaihir, or what his name is, would be understanding enough to fly Frodo from Rivendell to Mordor, if this would save Middle Earth. But this is of course a question, I should have asked Tolkien 25 years ago...Bottom line: I will wait eagerly for the extended DVD. Hopefully (as before with Lorien in part I and Treebeard in part II), this will add the much needed depths to the movie."
tt0993846,"The title of the film and its director were clearly enough to warrant seeing this one. But I was annoyed at how poor the acting was, and the incessant ultra-sharp close-ups of bad actors speaking mindless dialog made it too hard to watch more than the first half. While the storyline had a decent premise, its portrayal was shallow at best.There was almost no character development and no one you could identify with, which made it a bit better than a SNL skit. While the photography was good, it was put too bad use unless you like watching bimbos and greedy nerds frolic in cartoonish and gratuitous sex scenes.This wolf was a total dog. I'm not a great lover of Oliver Stone flicks, but his ""Wall Street"" puts this one to shame."
tt0816692,"I'm not a Nolan fan but I always want to give his movies a try because mostly I do like the general ideas for the stories that are told. I really tried to watch this one without prejudice. And after it was done, I sat there with the same feeling that I had after Inception: it's interesting but there is so much unnecessary ""action"" and plot holes that it loses so much of its potential. And that's sad!The first 40 minutes or so are really slow. After that the tempo goes up but so many details are overlooked that it becomes a bit hard to watch. This makes me very cynical and looking at the clock to see when the movie will be over. Also, playing with time is such an interesting idea but it has to be done right and you can't just be sloppy with details like I've seen more than a few times in this film.I wasn't crazy about McConaughey's performance, I kinda liked Hathaway. The visuals are good but I put on 2001: A Space Odyssey right after I finished Interstellar and to me these graphics are just as good, even though they're almost 50 years old. And the mood and eerie atmosphere are loads better! Besides, Interstellar seemed like a bit of a remake of 2001, and as is usually the case with remakes, not better than the original.I gave Interstellar a 5 star rating because of the concept and the effects."
tt0361748,"Quentin Tarantino. While the majority of people would tell you that he is a genius filmmaker who hasn't one bad film to his name, there is a small, but vocal minority who will tell you that while he is talented, he hasn't made anything fantastic for a while. Sure, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are masterpieces and Jackie Brown is his most mature work, but his other work has been deeply disappointing to say the least. The Kill Bill movies were self- indulgent, badly written and overly sadistic, and Death Proof was just boring. So would Inglourious Basterds be a late return to form? Well, while good, it doesn't present Tarantino at his best, and the film is still problematic as a whole.The story is that during their occupation of France, the Nazis premiere a propaganda film at a theater to celebrate their achievements. When this is found out, many use this as a plan to kill the Nazis once and for all, including the British army, the theater's owner Shoshanna who has a vendetta against the Nazis and a group known as the Basterds, a bunch of American Jews who have traveled to France in order to kill Nazis.While the plot is non-linear like Tarantino's other films, it suffers from the fact that there is a lot of pointless material in the film. Many characters who have no effect on the story are killed off, some scenes go on for way too long & some of the protagonists are deeply unlikable. This mainly implies to the Basterds themselves, who despite their cause, are portrayed as sadistic psychopaths who kill and torture many Nazis, despite some of the Nazis having legitimate grievances (i.e. having a child, keeping quiet to protect their fellow men). I'm not expecting a film like this to portray Nazis with Downfall-esque sympathy, but considering that most of the Nazis in the film are shown to be more human than in other films, the constant sadism feels unnecessary, and you can't help but feel that the Basterds are no better than the Nazis themselves.The film's sadism is a major problem. Tarantino has a weird love for extreme violence, which would be fine provided that this was a more tongue in cheek context, but considering that the movie has a mostly straight face, you can't help but feel that the movie goes too far in places. This includes cutting the scalps off Nazis, beating them to death with baseball bats, torturing an innocent witness by sticking their fingers into a bullet wound and seeing someone get strangled to death, made even more disturbing by how it is partially real (Tarantino actually strangled one of his actresses to make the film look more real). Lovely.It's a shame that the film is bogged down by being overly long and overly sadistic, as there is some great stuff in there. As many others have pointed out, the opening scene is brilliant. Great acting, dialogue, cinematography and pacing. It's also a perfect example of how Tarantino should use his unique brand of dialogue, to be quirky and advance the story, instead of using it to ramble. It's definitely the best scene in the film, and continues 2009's tradition of having great opening scenes (i.e. Watchmen, Up) in films.On top of this, some of the characters are very well done. Shoshanna is the best character in the film, being the most three-dimensional and interesting, and her story arc in the film is the most compelling because of it, essentially being the brilliant female revenge story that Kill Bill should have been. You just wish the whole movie was focused on her, but still, her scenes are where the film reaches its peak, and Melanie Laurent delivers one of the best (and sadly underrated) performances in recent memory. It's also a very well- made film. The cinematography is gorgeous, the sets and production design are well done, and the acting is very good from everybody, even though I feel that some are wasted, mainly that of Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz, the latter of whom does the absolute best with a weak character. If you want to see him at his best, watch The Zero Theorem instead.It's because of these things that I feel that while Inglourious Basterds is a slight return to form for Tarantino, it's still dragged down by many of Tarantino's usual faults. From the overly sadistic violence of the film, to the overlong running time, to the self-indulgent touches to the film (i.e. having a Mike Myers cameo, or Samuel L. Jackson as a narrator, clearly his easiest paycheck yet), the film's positive attributes, while present, are still balanced out by the film's many faults. It's definitely a step forward, but there's still some work to be done."
tt0139414,"OK, so Steve Miner's ""Lake Placid"" contains a collection of clich√©d characters - the sarcastic locals, the eccentric millionaire, and the scientist woman who freaks out at the sight of anything unpleasant - but you gotta love some of the things that the movie shows. When it got released, Entertainment Weekly's review of it was titled WHAT A CROC OF... and called it a monstrosity that sinks to the bottom. While obviously not any sort of high-value cinema, it's still a fun movie. The most interesting person in the movie is Betty White's character. She seems like the typical nice old lady, but she turns out to have a sharp tongue.Basically, the movie makes no pretense about what it is. I suspect that they had fun filming it. Producer David E. Kelley (Michelle Pfeiffer's husband) is best known for shows like ""Ally McBeal"" and is now behind ""Big Little Lies""."
tt0109842,"This film was excellent. The score well-used. It's well-acted, greatly written and executed, and it manages to capture a lot of nuances of childhood and children's behavior.The movie follows Fresh, a drug runner for two different major pushers in his hood. After a series of events he makes the decision to play the pushers as he would an opponent in chess. As the game of chess plays out over the last 15 minutes, the suspense grips you.The film guest stars Samuel L. Jackson as the absentee, alcoholic father of Fresh who is a great source for chess strategy, but not for compassion or love.The star of the film is the 12 year old (at the time) Sean Nelson, who does a fabulous job in the title role as Fresh.This movie makes Boys in the Hood, and Menace II Society look low-rate."
tt0468569,"How can a film like this be ever compared to a film like the godfather is laughable, i am a big comic book and superhero fan i particularly like this genre but i did not like the way this was handled whatsoever..the following points highlight my case why batman is nothing but a okay film.. 1- CONCEPTION AND CREATION everyone knows that one of the most exciting things about villains is there creation, and how they became they way they are, i believe the original batman films which Tim Burton directed handled this brilliantly, but look at Spiderman 2 which has a great villain. There was no flashback even to the creation of the joker character we must believe he has been there all along, as well as Two Face whos original coming of being i liked better in batman forever, not to say i like tommy lee Jones character portrayal any better than this 1.2-VIOLENCE this film had left a bitter taste after viewing i am a fan of violent films but it can be seen the way this was edited to ensure the upper catorgory of a pg-13 12a(uk) over here left the film looking a feeling like something was missing. Instead of showing the conseqeunce of for example a bullet in the head the camera would cut away leaving it for the audience imagination, another example of not showing violence and actually changing the tone of the film was robocop the R rated version when compared against the X rated version which seems lighter in tone.3-BATMAN now Batman played by Bale one of my favourite actors opted for a stupid gruff sounding voice which didn't work, also the suit castes were terrible and i mean truly bad, batmans suit made him look like a more well equipped navy seal or something, not the true mysticism that is batman which is lost in this film. There is no reference to bats whatsoever throughout the duration. Another letdown was the fight sequences which even though Bale did a lot himself did not look smooth, or good on the big screen.4-PLOT/PACINGthe plot has to many twists and turns and leaves some of the less cerebral most likely lost(not myself of course). The pacing is bad as there is one key action sequence in the middle of the film which did blow me away but the film never lived up to that particular sequence which is a shame, less morality and preachyness more ACTION! and on that note a spoiler which i do warn before hand, the ending i must say i disliked a lot, for lack of realism, depth and completion as it is left very much open of what happens to the joker character, my 2 cents please reply if you have maybe a differing opinion to mine, Spiderman 2 is one of the greatest comic book translations to films, as in the earlier batmans, (including returns) but this should never be uttered in the same sentence as a film like the Godfather, which i believe to be one of the greatest of all time, the greatest which i do believe is Once upon A time in America."
tt7286456,"Yes, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful job in his portrayal of the Joker. Albeit this Joker is plain and simple just mentally ill. He is generally portrayed in previous genres as a criminal genius mastermind. A person with wit, and masterful comprehension of trickery, and chemicals.This Joker is no fun, and highly delusional. You may question his intellect as he has to look up simple jokes in a diary he keeps. Yes, for the most part his jokes fall flat. Jack Nicholson' clever portrayal in Batman raised the bar that in my opinion has never quite been reached.I found myself uncomfortable with this portrayal as you would with someone acting out next to you on a subway. In that respect, Joaquin portrays this bit of brazen craziness to a tee. Craziness for the sake of craziness does not make for entertainment. If a sane person were locked up in a mental institution, you would not be entertained. And that is a bit how this movie felt."
tt0480025,"So many words could describe the feelings towards this series and I felt every moment of it, the emotion was pure and strong, and I was kept captivated through right til the very end, each character were so well defined, and all played a key roll the entire time, every emotion every struggle every hardship dug so deep, it made me tear everytime (now that's hard) I fell in love with this and I will continue to watch it for time to come.
A true masterpiece, deserves the full üîü üåü s"
tt0816692,"It's not a bad movie, but it's ordinary at best. Dialogue is very clumsy at times. It's too long, and way too much time is spent on explaining phenomenons that don't need to be explained. It could have been such an elegant and thought provoking movie, but instead it's dead set on explaining absolutely everything. It ruins the mystery, and the opportunity for me to use my own imagination. Unfortunately the time spent making sure that everyone in the audience understands the movie EXACTLY the way the director wants you to, is spent, at the expense of a good storyline and the development of believable characters and meaningful relationships. A funny idea, and a powerful soundtrack, just doesn't cut it for me. I was very underwhelmed and disappointed, but go see for yourself."
tt0120815,"Like so many of his generation, Steven Spielberg's father served in World War II. Therefore, the director had spent countless hours listening to Daddy describing his war-time experiences. Many years later, when Spielberg received a script about the battles on Omaha Beach in 1944, he therefore became enthusiastic. Making a film about the fight against the Nazis seemed a good way to pay tribute to Dad.The movie takes place on D-day, during the Allied invasion of Normandy towards the end of the war. It follows eight young American soldiers, struggling to find a certain Private Ryan behind enemy lines. And bring him back to the United States. Alive!Steven Spielberg hired a retired marine captain to prepare the actors for the grueling shoot. His ""boot camp"" lasted six days, with extremely tough military exercises. There was intensive weapons training, close combat drills and endless, individual maneuvers. The only thing the guys got to eat were K-rations of the same type that was used on the battlefields during the Second World War.Despite all the controversy regarding the amount of brutality portrayed, the film became a worldwide hit. It ultimately grossed over $500 million at the global box office. The movie also inspired a lively media debate about the increasing violence in popular culture. After winning a number of prestigious international awards, ""Saving Private Ryan"" collected eleven Academy Award nominations.Surprisingly, ""Saving Private Ryan"" lost to ""Shakespeare in Love"" for the best picture Oscar. Something that was considered one of the great controversies in the history of the Academy Awards. However, Steven Spielberg didn't go home empty-handed. For the second time in a few years, he won a best director Oscar. And, as in the case of ""Schindler's List"", it was for a film set during World War ll."
tt0120815,"I successfully avoided this until seeing Band of Brothers, which raised my previously low interest in Spielberg productions; having seen one too many of his mawkish, sentimental pieces of malarkey. Instead, it turns out it was wise to skip this for almost a decade.A troop that has just landed at Normandy is diverted to move 100m into France and find a single private whose value has just gone up. And sure... they walk the whole way (never even hitching a ride) They encounter provisioned troops every fifteen minutes along the way (any of which would have been more efficiently tasked with the mission.) and they find Ryan not alone & lost behind enemy-lines (maintaining radio silence, or in imminent danger); but amidst another platoon (also provisioned) and ready to take on a mission against 4 German tanks and about 80 Germans. Really... what a bunch of schlock!Why do people make up stories to tell about WW2 to show their respect for those who fought it? Make up characters? Invent a phony mission that never occurred? What? ...the hundreds of thousands of personal stories that exist didn't have enough dramatic range? This is a brazen slap in the face to all who fought.S.P.R. is just so much retrograde 1950's storytelling, and Spielberg doesn't have it in him to recognize cinematic cheese when he smells it. There's so much time for soldiers pouring out their hearts & having profound discussions that it's a wonder they even had time for a war. Spielberg is only a shade subtler than flashing subtitles every now and then that say, ""CRY NOW!"" and ""WAVE THE FLAG!"" I'm as susceptible as anyone to patriotism, but come on. The 3 stars I gave it are for the battle sequences. Every time the action slows & Spielberg needs to come up with something dramatic he delivers a pile of corn... and earns a barrel of lemons. Structurally this feels like a grab-bag of scenes made for an even longer movie. They find private Ryan almost effortlessly.And what's with the all-star cast, Hanks, Giamatti, Diesel, Damon, Danson, Hines, Ribisi... I can't imagine any of these guys are WW2 figures because they're all so overexposed in the current timeframe.I didn't need this giant pile of malarkey and all it's cheap sentiment to make me feel a debt to the Allies in WW2. I have reality to do that."
tt0167261,if you like the other  movie  this will gives you  more fights but not more story only  more fights   the  movie does not follow the book at all they have change the movie so its not   based on the booki think thats is very bad  but some people love it!what more can i say see it or leave it    but don¬¥t be to surprised if you are not finding that is happening in the book! rated  6 of 10 not more or less
tt0172495,"I don't know if this contains any spoilers, but you probably don't want to read this before viewing this movie.  I went unto the movie theater with excitement.  All the reviews that I had read about this movie raved about it's perfect marriage of stunning action and well-constructed plot.  What I found was an unrepentent melodrama of the worst stripe.  The audience nearly boo-ed and hissed everytime the villain came on screen, and cheered heavily upon the protagonist.  The script for Spice-World has more depth, and certainly more well-rounded characters.  Oh well, I thought.  At least I could sit back and enjoy the eye-candy.  And to a very limited extent, I did enjoy the gladatorial combats.  The only problem is that 90% of those scenes were in the commercials that had been run excessively before the release. Other computer-assisted action sequences were quite terribly done, such as the opening battle and all of the psychedelic flashbacks.  Overall, I feel that this is an embarrassing abortion of a movie.  It's popularity proves to Hollywood that the market for Steven Seagal movies is still expanding fast."
tt0993846,"I know I am going to get a lot of hate for this review, as this film was recommended to be by three friends whose opinion I value. I just didn't get it.The story is vaguely interesting but it is stretched atom-thin to encompass a ridiculous 3 hours!!Caprio and Hill give great performances but have very little to work with.The structure of the film is gratingly repetitive. * There will be a conversation on a taboo subject e.g. masturbation. * Someone gets their boobs out. * Someone gets wasted on drugs. * Caprio gives a rousing speech. * Repeat... for 3 hours!!Maybe I have become jaded but I don't find an ad-libbed conversation about throwing midgets particularly funny; not for PC reasons, it is just boring.Belfort seems to be a massive arse and I am sure he sits around his villa, watching this film about himself, chuckling about all the people he abused, betrayed and cheated."
tt0068646,"You may have bought into the hype and rightly so, for being made in 1971 it's pretty solid. The story if halfassed and the acting is mediocre. The voice and over the top Vito Corleone is funny in a sad way. This movie could have easily been cut down to an hour and a half and nothing would have gone awry. You could have guessed everything before it happened, very predictable. I just feel bad for the people saying it's the greatest movie e ver made. Maybe top 100 but I doubt it. Only older people who were blown away at the time by something entertaining still clutch at this boring waste of time."
tt0993846,"Since many critics emphasize on the overall quality of the movie and the artistry invested in it (no doubt about that), I'd like to write about three special moments in this movie which made my day.So behold ‚Äì SPOILERS are coming!Are you still with me? Good.1. The speeches at the ""Stratton Oakmont"" office.There is such an evangelical preaching power beaming from these sequences that even I as a reasonable man feel compelled by the egoistic nature of these motivational statements. Without a single doubt I can say that they represent both the best and the worst sides of the capitalistic culture. We can clearly see how a man can grow wild because of his ego, greed and lust. But without a single doubt I can agree with the director Scorsese that if you show the true nature of things in a comedic-sarcastic manner in the 21st century, you can only benefit from that. And what a performance from Di Caprio. Hands down2. First meeting between Belfort and FBI agent Denham on Belfort's boat.A very aggressive episode in which the viewer can see how the internal tension builds up and blows out between two strong characters. Although pride is the main reason for this wonderfully played confrontation, I can see again the competitive elements of the American culture clash between the two symbols of this adventurous society. Indeed this is a very important nodus in the story.3. The ""crawling"" episode when Belfort is trying to stop his buddy Azoff from making a call from his home and the ludicrous fight between them on the floor.This whole scene is exploring the limits of human will to overcome whatever obstacle there is in the name of self preservation. The play is so real that I thought for a moment that Di Caprio and Jonah Hill have experience with such situations (I guess celebrities' life isn't easier than the lifestyle of the main character of this movie). This whole episode is so controversial that I was wondering if I should laugh or cry about it. And after all I chose to laugh.""The Wolf of Wallstreet"" is a movie full of obscene content and crazy role playing. The director Scorsese is a bold and adventurous young soul (as always) and I admire him for that. We can all follow his example in our artwork.I guess that most of the people with moral values will condemn this film in a particular way. But it's expected and it's okay. And even though this movie is not THE best film of 2013, to me it has one of the best (if not the best) cinematic incarnations. There are scenes which are truly ""creme de la creme"". Profit and Ego are evident sins, but we all have them, so why moralize on this movie instead of just enjoy its merits and remember the morals at the end.Yes, we know it is bad to make a movie about these fellas (real life assholes), but as a part of our generation we can't stop cheering at all the wrong moments¬Ö :)"
tt1853728,"I tried to like this movie but I didn't.The ""story"" is really weak, only a pretext to show pointless violence that someone finds funny (not me).Waltz was OK but I didn't like his character. Foxx character on the other side is really awful. The way he behaves is really annoying and the fact that he becomes a skilled gunman in one lesson only is really unbelievable.The only actor that stands up is Di Caprio, but the violence he enjoys is similar to that of far fetched rated-18 horror comics; maybe teenagers finds that entertaining.I expected a surprising movie I found a boring and pointless one."
tt0422272,"The movie is worth a watch but it's not the kind that I will or need to watch again in the future. For that there are better movies in this genre. I thought the mechanical girl, the ""scary"" part of the movie, wasn't enough present to make it better. That was actually creepy but why did we have to wait so long before witnessing it? A missed opportunity if you ask me. Calista Flockhart, whom seems to have some facial work done, isn't a bad actress but she's not Oscar material either. Overal the movie is entertaining, the plot is okay, the creepy moments were good but sadly not enough exploited."
tt0172495,"Gladiator has become an icon of the 21st century of cinema. The film tells the story of Maximus (Russell Crowe), a former Romanian general turned slave and then gladiator, sets on a journey to avenge the death of his wife and son. Betrayed by the conspiring emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus must endure the brutal nature of the Colosseum and will stop at nothing until he's received his revenge.You can judge this film by so many different aspects. Just by the year this was made and the set pieces they were aiming to bring to life, I think they did a good job. The battle sequence in the beginning of the film is filled with extras and little use of CGI which to me is incredible. To orchestrate a set piece like this has got to be very difficult and yet they were able to achieve an exhilarating scene that really shows you the capabilities of the Roman Empire.Something about this sequence that bothered me and unfortunately continues throughout other fighting scenes is the shaking camera. It happens more in closeups as a means to give more realism to the scene. What it ultimately does, at least for me, is turn the scene all blurry, not being able to comprehend what's going on and miss out on what otherwise is a gut wrenching duel.I don't think I need to expand on the acting. There is a reason Russell Crowe won an oscar for his performance and Jouaquin Phoenix was nominated. The rest of the cast brings out some of their best performances as well.As for the score and direction, Hans Zimmer brings to life the empire that was Rome. With a thrilling score that keeps your heart beating fast and shifts the emotion of the different plot points. I think this is one of Ridley Scott's best films. I saw a good chunk of his films and other than ""The Martian"" and ""The Last Duel"" (both terrific) Gladiator is honestly a work of art.This film has gore, grittiness, drama, suspense and action. It serves as a time piece of the Roman Empire, investing time and care to thoroughly map out every single detail there is. The runtime is just over two and a half hours.This film has gore, grittiness, drama, suspense and action.

tt0167260,"Though certainly an improvement upon the second film in this already classic trilogy, I must say I am shocked that of all the incredible films I could name right off the top of my head that could be sitting in the fifth position in IMDb's list of Top 250 Highest Rated Films, this is the one that's sitting there. I know I'm quite tardy in my viewing of this movie, and I've known of its sky-high praise for the four or five years it's been in release, and I thought that even though the subject matter, as I explained in my reviews of the preceding two Lord of the Rings films, is not my cup of tea, I would see what everyone else sees in these movies. I was very fond of the first one, I was grateful when I saw the ending credits of the second one, and though I found myself entertained more than the second one by the third one, I was even more grateful when the final credits arrived. I will start with what I liked: The battle sequences in this film were much better than the ones in its predecessor. I thought the second film's battles were lame and this time around, they had a lot of intensity, and I found myself drawn in. Where I found myself riveted was during the climax, the fate of the ring to be determined on a coarse cliff over molting lava, and everything unexpected happens and all of the present characters in the scene have tension that finally culminates and releases, and I finally truly found myself caring about the ring, even if it doesn't make sense that Shalob can stink Frodo through a supposedly impermeable vest.But now, let's get down to brass tacks about the denouement. I have never seen a movie that ends as many times as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. After awhile, I was counting the ""final"" scenes. Counting! Then, I found myself shocked that I had given up on counting. Who counts endings to one movie? I cannot stand a badly paced film. I've always thought of directors like Peter Jackson as directors who are particularly good at keeping a brisk pace, no matter how long the movie is. But, not only do his endings lag in this single film, but they are plagued further by two horrible things: 1) Every time one ending closes, it fades out and the screen remains black for several seconds. Then it fades up again, having fooled you and the interest that causes you to stay with a film to the end has left. This happens every-single-time-the-movie-makes-you-think-it's-ending. 2) After awhile, this series of endings becomes intensely contrived and meaningless. We don't need to see most of the things that happen! And if Jackson still wants us to see what happens to these characters, as these things must in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, he should pace it better so that it does not feel stretched, tacked on, or contrived. Perfect way to achieve this: Get rid of the deceptive fade-outs!I enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring, and I suppose the last two films had their moments, but all I can say is that I am glad that I'm finished with this trilogy and that I don't have to worry about seeing them ever again."
tt0637420,"Movie fan Lucy is persuaded by a neighbor (Reta Shaw) to take over a Maps-of-the-Movie-Stars business when the latter has to move away suddenly.A decent, but not outstanding effort that has some good and bad points. The celebrity cameos at the end make this one notable and it's nice to see Lucy have an actual hobby. However, I never cared for the Lucy-in-drag episodes because the writers always end up making her needlessly destructive and it's not really funny. We also get another gorilla appearance here just four episodes after the last time we saw one.The curiously named Flip Mark makes his second appearance on the show, here playing a rival teenage map-seller who gets territorial with Lucy. His delivery here is more standard than the unique line readings he gave in Season 3's ""Lucy and the Missing Stamp.""The Carole Lombard magazine Lucy shows Reta Shaw was an authentic issue of Screen Play from September 1936.Bert Freed as the militant hotelier can be seen trying to stifle laughter at one of Lucy's lines.One of the female extras can be seeing wearing the outrageous green hat Ms. Ball wore in Season 3's ""Lucy Goes to Vegas""."
tt0372784,"My only criticism of this otherwise brilliant movie is that it is a little too long. But it is an extremely good film, that along with the original Batman could very well be the best of the Batman films(thought perhaps just lacking the original film's sophistication). People may find this blasphemy, but I did prefer this over The Dark Knight, but that was still very good. Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is stylish, dark and gritty, pretty much what Batman should be. I have seen complaints that the film ""contradicts"" the 1989 film. Perhaps so, but what I can say in the film's defence is that Batman Begins is sort of a very loose prequel to the original movies.Visually, Batman Begins looks absolutely incredible! It could very well be the most beautiful visually of the Batman films, with beautiful cinematography and a simply dazzling view of Gotham City itself. Another asset I appreciated was that the music score didn't overpower the action, in fact it gave some atmospheric flavour to it. As much as Danny Elfman's scores were outstanding and definitely memorable, Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard do a great job with the score.The script is taut and well-written with lines that really make you think along with some occasional offbeat humour, the plot isn't convoluted or predictable but original, the film moves briskly(the second half was marginally better in terms of pacing to the first half though but that is in no way a flaw) and the action is explosive particularly the climax and the bat-mobile car-chase. Also Christopher Nolan's direction is excellent.The acting, aside from the visuals is what drives the film. Christian Bale is for me the best Batman since Michael Keaton. In the role of Batman he is suitably dark and brooding, like Batman should be, and as Bruce Wayne, he is dashing, handsome and ambitious. Katie Holmes actually surprised me and in a good way. She wasn't bland or annoying, I actually found her sympathetic and surprisingly good. Liam Neeson is also very good, though he has been better, while Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred. Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson and the excellent, underrated Gary Oldman are also solid in their roles, while Morgan Freeman is wonderful as always.Overall, a brilliant film that is visually stunning, gripping and atmospheric. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0167260,"I've just re-watched The Lord of the Rings trilogy for the 1000th time tonight... nearly 15 years since the Fellowship of the Rings was released... I still haven't seen a movie that's better, nor close, to any of these three films. The casting is perfection as well as the incredible acting by everyone in the movie. I can still watch these movies back to back and not get bored. They are a light to this world and wouldn't be the same without them.I miss the good old LOTR's days. The best movies ever created. The Return of the King was the best way to end a thrilling journey through middle earth!"
tt1130884,"Finally, a horror/thriller that actually, genuinely scares the crap out of you. Not because it has fancy villains in masks or sadistic buckets of gore throughout. No, it scares you because it messes with your mind. Most will hate this movie, they don't like their brains being tampered with. I loved it. It's what we needed after all those gory R-rated and sometimes lame-duck PG-13 horror crap-fests.The horror/thriller genre has been raped lately, with gore and scantily clad- women replacing the noir and terror that Alfred Hitchcock perfected in the '50s and '60's. Here director Martin Scorsese delivers in full blast, crafting a thriller in his own unique vision. The atmosphere throughout the movie is tense and unsettling. Slow as it may be, but it is crucial to the movie and it's genuinely gripping. Your attention WILL not be lost. The scenery is beautiful and finely done with no excessive lighting, grain or darkness. The editing by Thelma Schoonmaker is fluid and pitch-perfect, and never makes the film lose focus. The movie is based on a book by Dennis Lehane and is packed with twists and turns that will leave you breathless and uneasy. The movie cranks the breathlessness and uneasiness up to the power of 5. The music is also perfectly suited with the scenes. There is sometimes no music during suspenseful moments, and sometimes the music makes the scene even more disturbing and memorable. Alfred Hitchcock's noirish thriller style is back with a vengeance, here to teach today's moviegoers the REAL meaning of suspense and horror.All the actors in the movie are in top-form. Once again, you can't go wrong with a Leonardo DiCaprio/Martin Scorsese collaboration. As the protagonist, we the audience are thrust into his shoes and we are about as confused and scared as his character is, we feel what he feels. It becomes a psychological trip that poses many, many questions about oneself, that to discuss them here would spoil the entire movie. There are some flashbacks in the movie, but all of them are important clues to DiCaprio's character. DiCaprio gives a stunning performance, once again tempting the Academy to give him another Best Actor nomination. DiCaprio gives a vivid portrayal of a vulnerable, haunted and ultimately terrified man. Apart from DiCaprio there's really not much I can say about the supporting cast, because they are all also terrific. Ben Kingsley; Mark Ruffalo; Michelle Williams; Max Von Sydow; Jackie Earle Haley; Emily Mortimer; Patricia Clarkson; Ted Levine; Elias Koteas; John Carroll Lynch. All of them.In short, this is a psychological and frightening masterpiece that will make you scared, will make you think, and will make you seek psychological help. This is one of the best films of the year. See it, go in with an open mind and prepare to be blown away.Overall value: 9/10."
tt1345836,"The movie was so boring and lengthy that I considered to leave the cinema. The script was predictable at some points and the acting was so poor amongst some of the actors. Anne Hathaway was horrible, she was not convincing at all and her outfit looked like a cheap Halloween costume. Bane, the main villain of this movie was killed in a split second and everything was forgotten about him, that's it. It's like the script writers wanted this movie to end quickly as possible at this point. The actor playing Miranda who appears to be Ra's Al Ghul's daughter Talia should get the award for worst death presentation, it was some of the worst acting I have ever seen, you can tell that she is acting. It's like she is taking a nap for crying out loud. Blake who appears to be Robin gets access to the Batman cave and all the high tech stuff that is in there, but he didn't receive any training at all so he wouldn't know how to use it. Robin is just an ordinary cop in this movie with no combat skills, yet Bruce Wayne gives away the cave to him and settles down with the supposed Catwoman."
tt1130884,"Acting? Top notch. Cinematography? Perfect. Grotesque images? In spades. Foreboding music? You bet. Gothic atmosphere? Ooo-eee-ooo.The problem here is the story and the way it is told. I had read Dennis Lehane's novel going in and knew the basic arc of the story and the big reveal at the end, but this version stuffs way too much into a relatively simple mystery story. Shutter Island could be ... THIS! Or it could be ... THAT! Or it could be ... SOME OTHER AWFUL THING! And why do we need World War II flashbacks? What do Nazis and Holocaust victims add to the story, except to give Scorcese a chance to show mournful starving Jews, a pile of bodies topped by a heartbreaking little dead girl clutching at her dead mother and an, admittedly masterful, tracking shot of Nazis being mowed down by righteous GIs. Take that, Quentin.And here's a small annoyance. As the GIs enter what is clearly stated as Dachau concentration camp, which is in Germany, we see the famous arch that says, ""Arbeit macht frei"" (work sets you free). Trouble is, that arch isn't at Dachau, it's at Auschwitz, which is in Poland. Auschwitz was liberated by the Red Army. Why can't Scorcese leave well enough alone? Things are over amplified. You can't just show a Nazi commandant's office, it has to be full of blowing paper. You can't just have stormy weather, it has to be a raging hurricane. You can't just show a woman living in a cave, you have to be sure we see the canned rations and canteen of water that keep her alive. Things to marvel at, for sure, but ultimately distracting.After a while, it's hard to tell when U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leo DiCaprio) is hallucinating and when he is not. In one scene, he wakes up from a bad dream and immediately begins hallucinating ... or is it more of the bad dream? Hmm. One can almost hear Scorcese say, ""Hey, let's not just blow up a car, let's put Teddy's hallucinated wife and daughter into the explosion!"" Taken together, these things cause a lot of suspense to drain out of the movie and it ends up being a gorgeously made creep-out flick."
tt1853728,"It's not that there is no humor; I laughed out loud maybe twice. Very early on, though, it becomes clear that we are supposed to be enthralled (amused? impressed?) by unrealistic gun play and explosive red blots, and that theme continues throughout.Christoph Waltz clearly enjoyed his role and performs it with relish and a twinkle in his eye. Every time he opened his mouth, I thought ""Richard Dreyfuss""--I don't say that is either good nor bad, but to me, it was Waltz playing Dreyfuss playing this role.Jamie Foxx seemed to take his role too seriously, as the movie does not deserve it, or maybe he just doesn't do comedy well anymore (I seem to remember some funny bits on ""In Living Color"", but that was long ago.) Samuel Jackson played his role as ""house Negro"" well, but he didn't do himself much honor by taking it. There were some good cameos, particularly Don Johnson as a slaveowner in Tennessee, and Franco Nero as an Italian owner of a Mandingo fighter in Mississippi. Quentin Tarantino's cameo was ridiculously bad acting; he should refrain from putting himself in future movies.Leonardo DiCaprio's role as a degenerate slaveowner was generally well portrayed, from a stylistic point of view. I would say his character's dialogue was not particularly well written, but he has no particular cause for complaint, as bad dialogue prevails throughout, except for some ill-fitting attempts at intellectual discourse, which I saw as showy and superficial in such a mindlessly violent exercise. (I suppose the bad dialogue could be said to be intentional, but it earns Tarantino no credit.)What else? I don't object to the excessive use of the 'n' word, as it probably is realistic for the period. Unlike, say, ""Huckleberry Finn"", its use doesn't have anything profound to say about slavery except that some slaves would really have liked to kill every white person in sight (not too surprising, probably). The closest to something meaningful was when DiCaprio's character asks the interesting question: ""Why do the slaves not kill their masters?"" and doesn't answer it. Clearly many of the bad guys deserved what they got, but not all of them, and the script shows little discrimination (so to speak). The plot was tediously predictable, though I do admit I knew the outlines of it before I went in to see it.Tarantino's use of old-fashioned spaghetti Western titles, Nero, and the song performed in Italian (could get a nomination, if the field is weak enough) was probably his most interesting directorial motif, but it was neither surprising, funny, nor profound."
tt0108052,"""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire"", Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley)A film, one of Spielberg's best which details some of the horrific, and in human consequences of WW2 has been one of the best rated, and talked about movies about the holocaust in recent history. Schindler's list, presented in a black and white format enhances the visual wounds, and emotional feelings of this dark chapter in human history, without actually being involved in this era of time.   We begin the film by meeting Schindler, an excellent performance by Liam Neeson, of which we see he is a successful, generous business man. As the film unfolds, we see him changing as a person as the thousands of people are forced out of their homes, separated and sent to the camps, continued by mass killings, torture and larbour. The film also illustrates in detail the other horrors endured by the Jews, plus Schindler's friendship to Itzhak Stern, and eventually concluding by his speech, in which he announces the war is over, followed by Schindler breaking down after the years of murder he has just witnessed.The film as a whole then ends, returning to colour, making Spielberg successfully creating a field of depression in the 1940's, seperated against today's world: a more human place to live! It is here where Schindler is remembered, and the results of what he did are shown as how it matters today!Personal rating: 9/10"
tt0848228,"Before I say everything that was wrong with the movie, I will first say that I am familiar with the comics and source material, and have thought all the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies so far were decent. My personal favorite is Ironman 1, one of my favorite movies overall, because of the way it told the story and how it maintained more realism than the other movies in the franchise series of Marvel movies. Physics, engineering, and basic foundations of life were followed while telling the story of Tony Stark. Everything, while elaborate, seemed possible. Possible is the key word.I grew up watching Bill Bixby be the Incredible Hulk with Lou and thought the show was awesome. I do know, though, that technology wasn't around the make Hulk be what the comic wanted him to be. The Hulk movie therefore was decent but nothing I am dying to watch again. Captain America and Thor were decent too.So what was I expecting when I saw Avengers? I was expecting the 1992 Dream Team. I was expecting a movie that would be epic in every way where each character was maximized to their fullest while trying to solve a deep plot similar to The Watchmen or even the recent Dark Knight Trilogy. I got neither. The plot, in my opinion, was way too simplified and even worse, all the characters seemed to be more forgettable.I will say some of the casting was quite poor and didn't flow with the original intent of the characters and some were just annoying in their roles. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner, in particular, were very unwatchable even though like Lost in Translation and The Hurt Locker.Overall, I can see how this movie made so much money. It is the perfect movie to take younger kids and comic book fans. It is actually even better for those that don't know the source material because they are coming into the movie fresh. However, this is no Dark Knight type of movie with the depth of plot, real-world story lines, or the perfect casting. I give it 7/10 and hope Avengers 2 is a lot better executed."
tt0816692,"I knew nothing about Interstellar other than the basic premise, and the name of a film's director is of little interest to me i.e. I know who the good directors are, but their name on the credits doesn't set my expectations at any level.I just want a good plot, good acting, and something to take away and think about when the credits roll.I got none of that with this sorry excuse for a sci-fi film.From corn fields to a worm hole? with nothing much in between? Really? Anyway, I thought CASE and TARS were straight out of Minecraft... and so was the whole premise of Interstellar. A nothing sort of movie that leaves the viewer with nothing of substance.Motorcycle, meet shark! Actually, just take the shark from the tank and slap Christopher Nolan across the face with it.The 9 and 10 star reviews here truly mystify me..."
tt0361748,"Greetings again from the darkness. Quentin Tarantino and the Coen Brothers are whom I depend to always deliver something never previously seen on screen. Creativity of itself is not sufficient ... but when combined with a love and mastery of film-making, more often than not we are treated to something special. QT certainly delivers that with the Basterds.I found Chapter One (of Five) to be a mini-spaghetti western film short replete with perfect music, anticipation, stare downs, word play, a shoot-out and ultimate escape. Christoph Waltz immediately seizes his role as Col Landa and never lets go. He envisions himself, not as the ""Jew Hunter"" (a moniker he relishes, nonetheless) but rather as a super sleuth in line with Sherlock Holmes (hence the pipe!).Chapter Two introduces us to the titular Basterds led by Lt Aldo Raine with Brad Pitt as the hillbilly ring leader of the Dirty Dozen-type band of Nah-Zee killers. Pitt's exaggerated jaw and outlandish accent, coupled with his QT-penned dialogue, makes for one frightening cartoon character on a singular mission. And at the same time, it is a real hoot! The multiple story lines begin to intermingle in a fabulously intricate tavern scene. The dialgoue and approach to this remind a bit of Reservoir Dogs, but with the subtle facial gestures and multi-lingual word play, it goes to a whole different level. While many thought this scene dragged, I was fascinated.The finale in the Cinema Paradiso (not really, but it was the first thing I thought of) is well paced and delivers a fabulous ending of dramatic violent intimacy in the projector room and flamboyant special effects in the main theatre. Let's just say Lincoln's last night at the theatre ended better than Hitler's and Goebbel's.So many movie references in the 2 and a half hours that you can't help but tip your cap to Mr. Tarantino. For us movie lovers, he really is our leader. He is living out our fantasy and delivering just often enough to keep us fed. As an example, the lead up to the Cinderella scene is just pure torture as QT works in his foot fetish. Having previously mentioned the work of Pitt and the fantastic turn by Christoph Waltz, I must also say that Melanie Laurent in her red dress, helped capture the feel of 40's and 50's femme fatales. She was absolutely perfect.While this one is not quite at the level of Pulp Fiction, it is purely a cinematic marvel. Though not the most accurate of history lessons, there is still a bit of message that sneaks in. But more importantly, the message of cinematic adoration can't be missed. Bravo Mr. Tarantino. And thank you again."
tt0139414,"'Lake Placid' is a great example of mixing comedy with horror. It absolutely does not take itself too seriously and just has a lot of fun with the concept of a giant man eating croc on the loose. Having Betty White in the film makes it all that much better. The banter between Gleeson and Platt is hilarious and makes it all very light. However, there are still plenty of tense moments. The CGI and practical effects are pretty good too for 1999.Just like how 'Jaws' is the standard for shark movies, I still consider this the standard for crocodile/alligator movies."
tt0167260,"After the glory of the first film, and the almost-glory of the second, I was expecting better from this film than Peter Jackson delivered.Up until now he had been fairly true to the storyline.  Not so with this film.  I won't spoil it for those who haven't read the book and/or seen the film, but all I will say is that the ending to this film is, shall we say, different.A three hour film is fair enough, and I can happilly sit through one. Except when the last half hour or so is as bad as this one.  It could so easilly have been cut down to a reasonable length, just by following the plot.  Instead Mr Jackson, in his wisdom, decided it would be good to change the ending completely and extend it by about 30 minutes.I was on the verge of walking out it got so boring to the end.A bit of a disappointment really.  Such a shame as he started out so well with the other two parts."
tt0167261,"Some of us may know the back story of how Tolkien himself never wanted his books to be made into a film and I have to say that I agree with him, much of the magic of his books were in the finer details and these could never be conveyed well in a film. Here we have a film that's well done in some ways yet in the grand scheme of things it was never needed, the books stand alone and this trilogy of movies are a perhaps selfish project? -that are essentially a compromised vision of the books, this big budget 'action' movie would serve those looking for a feast of CGI effects and action sequences, thankfully there is some subtlety and the interplay between characters is the films saving grace and I appreciate the tasteful selection of dialog used for the most part. One of my big beefs with The Two Towers and the other 2 movies is just how nonthreatening Sauron is in these films, I think this aspect weakens the movies a great deal, even the ring wraiths come across as impotent compared to creatures such as the Urak Hai. Another is the abrupt transitions between scenes, and the movies lose much of the 'glue' that the books had tying everything together. Finally 'some' of the CGI effects don't do justice to the imagination - Sauron's eye, and the faces in the dead marsh seem to suffer like Gladrieal did in the previous movie - a little bit too overly dramatic and washed out - I am only mentioning this as a comparison to the majority of effects in this movies which are actually very well done. Also the costumes are excellent, I especially thought the depictions of the orcs were excellent. Overall I can only give this 5 stars."
tt0429078,"I was expecting more from the this film. Thats not to say it was good, it was decent, but thats all. For a seemingly high budget film with many famous Hong Kong stars, I really expected some kind of real epic fighting film.What lets this film down is its choppy nature, the film did not flow. There were too many characters, not enough depth, and I found the females were portrayed as pretty much helpless, needing protecting and all this kind of thing. Feminists won't like this film.The villains with all the face paint looked the business, it would've been nice to see these villains actually pose a real threat to the seven swords, except they just remained in the film as cannon fodder. One wonders why they cover the movie posters and so on, they had no importance in the film and get killed off.Yes, and like all Chinese films a person dies tragically, most often the female love interest. Not very original.Like already mentioned, there were some scenes that were just pointless like them finding this snake style sword. The inclusion of too many sub-characters was not a good idea.The positives. Some of the fight scenes were good, some just weren't. Some of the seven swords were cool, some weren't (Leon Lai).Overall it is a good watch, easily forgettable."
