    "- An A/B test is like a competition between two versions of something to see which one performs better. Imagine you have two different versions of a webpage or a feature on a website – Version A (the current version) and Version B (the new version). You want to find out if Version B is better at getting users to do something, like clicking a button or signing up for a service.\n",

    "To test a new feature on the website, we need to perform an A/B test. The success metric is the monthly click rate. Based on past data, the current click rate is 40%, and we expect this new feature to increase the click rate by 2% (relative increase). We have a daily sample size of 5,000, and we want to show the new feature to half of the users. If we want to be 90% confident in the results, approximately how many days do we need to run the A/B test?"
